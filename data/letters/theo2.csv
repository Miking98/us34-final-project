Mesdames Slocumb and Urquhart
Mesdames: I have the pleasure to inform you that my necessities which caused the request for permission to use your house during your absence this summer have been relieved. I have taken the house of General Twiggs, late of the United States Army, for quarters.
Inclined never on slight causes to use the power entrusted to me to grieve even sentiments only entitled to respect from the courage and lady-like propriety of manner in which they are averred, it is gratifying to be enabled to yield to the appeal you made for favor and protection by the United States.
Yours shall be the solitary exception to the General Rule adopted -- that they who ask protection must take upon themselves corresponding obligations or do an equal favor to the Government.
I have an aged mother at home, who, like you, might request the inviolability of hearthstone and roof-tree from the presence of a stranger. For her sake you shall have the pass you ask, which is sent herewith.
As I did myself the honor to say personally, you may leave the city with no fear that your house will be interfered with by any exercise of military right, but will be safe under the laws of the United States.
Trusting that the inexorable logic of events will convict you of wrong toward your country when all else has failed. I remain,
Your Obedient Servant,
Benj. F. Butler, Major General Comdg."

I have nothing to do with purchasing any furniture. I expect to collect $500 or $1000 for General Twiggs on Monday or Tuesday, but may be disappointed. I have already paid $216 out of my private funds for matting.

To General Dix
My dear General: When I read your decision and patriotic order as Secretary of Treasury to ""shoot on the spot"" whomsoever should attempt to haul down the American Flag, my heart bounded with joy. It was the first bold stroke of the Union under the past administration.
It gives me therefore redoubled pleasure more directly to testify my admiration by sending you the identical flag of the Revenue Cutter ""McClellan,"" which was the subject of that order, together with the Confederate flag which was hoisted by traitor hands in its place.
David Ritchie, a young Scotch Sailor on board that boat, remaining true to his adopted country when so many of her sons proved recreant, went on board the ""McClellan"" when she was being burnt by the Confederates and brought off the Flags.
His affidavit which accompanies this will give the detail of facts. I doubt not the Secretary of the Treasury will permit you to retain the flags, which could not be in better hands. Believe me, General,
Most truly Yours

The President
Sir: I have the honor to send you with this note three swords with their equipments, formerly belonging to David E. Twiggs, late Brevet-Major General in the army of the United States.
They are each presentation swords. One given him by resolution of Congress which bears the following legend:
""Presented by the President of the United States agreeable to a resolution of Congress to Brig. Gen'l. David E. Twiggs, in testimony of the high sense entertained by Congress of his gallantry and good conduct in storming Monterey.
Resolution approved March 2nd, 1847.""
Another by the State of Georgia, and bears the following legend and inscription:
""Constitution
The State of Georgia to Major General David E. Twiggs, U. S. A., as a tribute to his gallantry in Mexico 1847. Palo Alto, Resaca de la Palma, Monterey, Cerro Gorde, Chapultepec, Molino del Rey, Mexico.""
The third by his native City, Augusta, Ga., and has the following legend: ""Texas, 8th and 9th of May 1846, Monterey, Vera Cruz, Cerro Gorde. To Gen'l. David E. Twigg from the citizens of Augusta, Georgia.""
General Twiggs left these swords with a young woman on the evening before he fled from New Orleans, and in his flight on the day of the approach of the fleet, he wrote in his carriage while en route this extraordinary paper.
""I leave my swords to Miss Rowena Florence, and box of silver.
New Orleans, 25th, April, 1862
David E. Twiggs""
This paper was claimed as a deed of gift of these very valuable weapons by the young person named, but as she had neglected to inform her father of this singular donatio causa fugae, and as the girl's mother caused them to be given to a negro to be sent to Gen'l. Twiggs' house, and as they were found in possession of this negro, I venture to interfere with this testamentary disposition.
A more lamentable instance of the degradation to which this rebellion has reduced its votaries can hardly be imagined.
Swords given to a General for courage and good conduct in the armies of the Union as tokens of admiration by his fellow-citizens and the gratitude of a State and Nation, voluntarily bequeathed for safe-keeping to a woman as a more proper custodian than himself, by that same General, when flying at the approach of the Armies of that country which he had renounced and betrayed, at last find a depository with a negro, for the sake of enslaving whom even the double crime of treachery and rebellion had been consummated.
Now that the weapon given by the United States is returned to the Executive, and the others placed at his disposal, might I take leave to suggest a possible disposition of them.
Might not the first be presented to some Officer as a token of appreciation of loyalty and devotion to the country?
The qualities of courage and good conduct on the battle-field have never been found wanting in our armies, but loyalty and entire devotion to the country have failed in so many examples of which General Twiggs is a shining one, that some token of respect for those qualities bestowed in this manner, might not be inappropriate.
The sword from the State of Georgia might be deposited in the Library of West Point, with an appropriate inscription, as a perpetual memento to the youths there, how worse than useless are all education and military training, even when allied to gallantry and courage, if heartfelt patriotism and undying fidelity to the Constitution and the Flag are wanting.
That given by the City of Augusta might be deposited in the Patent Office as a warning against the folly and uselessness of such an invention as ""Secession.""
Pardon the freedom of these suggestions and believe me most faithfully,
Your obedient Servant,
Benj. F. Butler, Maj. General Commanding"

Sir: Enclosed will be found several letters addressed to ""General David E. Twiggs, late of the U. S. Army,"" by his son-in-law, Col. Myers, late of the army and now Quartermaster General, I believe, of the Confederate State Government.
The letter of Nov. 12th, 1860, which encloses the order for General Twiggs to take command in Texas, shows that at
that early day he was contemplating the treason he has since acted, and that he sought the very place so as to be in position to do the utmost mischief.
The others of dates May 16th, 22nd, and 26th, disclose the reasons of his appointment as ""Provisional General"" by the rebel Government, and his declination of the position of Major General.
All these were found in his house, which I have taken possession of, and with its furniture have had put in order for quarters for myself and a portion of my staff.
I have caused all the property here which General Twiggs owned or of which he received the income, to be sequestered, and the rents, after paying expenses, to be held to await the action of the Government of the United States. I have the honor to be,

My dear General: Will you allow me to add my congratulations to those of your many friends on your late successes. I have watched them with deep interest, and done all I could to cooperate by a little scribbling and newspaper censorship on my own hook.
I believed in your star when it was a little under a cloud of detraction, and I enjoy immeasurably the display of its fuller light. If I can serve you in any way here, pray use me. I will with pleasure attend to any wish or commission. I have been a thousand times tempted to give up everything here and join you, and have used every exertion to get a leave of absence to do so, in vain. I was in Boston day before yesterday, and found Fay very busy in your matters. I envied him for having it in his power to serve you. He is a splendid fellow. In the cars, hotels, and in fact everywhere, the name of Butler was in all, and in the churches. My old Uncle, Captain Bailey, U. S. N., was greatly pleased with you. He is a staunch old fellow and loves a row.
Be so kind as to present me kindly to the gentlemen of your military family.

Major General B. F. Butler
General: My last communication to you entrusted for delivery to Cuthbert Bullett, Esq. then on the point of departing for New Orleans, bore date on the 23rd instant, and since that time I have received your despatches of the 17th, 18th, and 19th, instant, with their various enclosures.
The suggestion made in your despatch of the 10th instant, as to a ""qualified amnesty,"" has been brought to the notice of the President, and his determination shall be announced to you with the least possible delay.
The attention of the President has also been drawn to your General Order No. 41, requiring certain oaths from foreigners resident at New Orleans, as well as to your correspondence on that subject with the Acting British Consul, -- and two communications relative thereto have been received from the State Department, of which copies are herewith transmitted to you, by direction of the President, for your information and guidance.
The Department has likewise received from the Secretary of State the enclosed copy of certain instructions issued by him to the Hon. Reverdy Johnson, to examine and report as to the facts touching the sugars claimed by certain British, French, and Grecian merchants, of which mention was made in your despatch of the 17th instant; and also a letter, of which a copy is enclosed, approving your course with reference to the Mexican Consulate, which it gives me great pleasure to transmit to you.
The views expressed in your despatch of the 25th May, to which you again refer in that of the 18th instant, as to the
policy to be preserved in regard to persons held under the laws of Louisiana to labor or service, but whom the fortune of war have placed within your command, -- have strongly impressed me. It has not yet, however, been deemed necessary or wise to fetter your judgment by any specific instructions in this regard.
Your last despatch upon this subject, and the accompanying report of General Phelps, which were not received until the 28th inst. shall be laid before the President. Pending his consideration, and any action which he may see fit to take thereon, it is confidently hoped that, exercising your accustomed skill and discretion, you will so deal with this question as to avoid any serious embarrassment to the Government, or any difficulty with General Phelps. Your cordial commendations of his skill, experience, and courage renders the Department very unwilling to forego the aid of his services.
The news of the brilliant achievement of Lieut. Col. Kimball of the 12th Maine Vols., and the brave men under his command at Manchac Pass, was very gratifying to the Department, and it entirely approves your action in allowing the Regiment to retain the colors which they had so gallantly taken from the enemy.
Information has reached the Department that General McClellan has met with a serious reverse in front of Richmond. Though the details have not transpired, it is quite certain that the published accounts are very much exaggerated. The army has changed its base, with comparatively little loss, to a much stronger position (Turkey Point) on the James River, and will, it is confidently expected, very soon march on and into Richmond. I am, General.
Very respectfully, Your obedient servant,
Edwin M. Stanton, Sec. of War
Department of State, Washington, 24th June, 1862 The Honorable E. M. Stanton, Secretary of War
Sir: I notice that Major General Butler is represented to have required certain oaths from foreigners at New Orleans. Though his general right, pursuant to martial law, to make any exactions which he may deem necessary for the peace and safety of the District under his command, cannot be questioned, the expediency of requiring oaths from those who do
not owe a permanent allegiance to the Government is so doubtful that I am directed by the President to request you to order him to discontinue that practice for the future, and to cancel any such obligations which may thus have been compulsorily contracted. Foreigners owe temporary allegiance to the authorities wherever they may reside. From this nothing but a treaty stipulation can absolve them. In general, however, it is best to observe that they will observe this allegiance. If, however, they disregard it, the particular acts by which this disregard may be shown are liable to punishment by the civil, or if this should be silent or inadequate, by martial law. It is preferable for the maintenance of harmonious relations with foreign powers that misconduct on the part of their citizens or subjects within our jurisdiction should not be anticipated, but that its actual development should be awaited. When it shall have occurred, is notorious in particular instances, or shall be susceptible of due proof, their Governments cannot reasonably complain if the guilty parties are punished in proportion to their offence.
This department having been officially apprised by the British Legation here that Mr. Coppell had been duly appointed Acting British Consul at New Orleans, I will again thank you to direct General Butler to respect his official acts accordingly. It is to be regretted that the General should have deemed it advisable to issue a certain order in consequence of which that gentleman deemed it necessary formally to relinquish his Consular functions. He has been requested through the British Legation here to resume them. I have the honor to be, Sir,
Your Obedient Servant, William Seward
Department of State, Washington, 27th June, 1862 To the Honorable E. M. Stanton, Secretary of War
Sir: I have the honor to inform you that I have just held an interview with Mr. Stuart, Her Britannic Majesty's Charge d'Affairs, in the course of which he has assured me that the letters of Mr. Coppell, the British Acting Consul at New Orleans, to the legation here, and everything else concerning him which has come to their knowledge, have uniformly shown entire fairness towards this Government. It is to be apprehended, therefore, that General Butler in his correspondence with Mr. Coppell, especially that which relates to certain sugars at New Orleans, must have assumed a contrary
hypothesis, and that in the severity of his remarks he has done that gentleman injustice. I will, consequently, thank you to communicate the fact and express to General Butler the President's desire that he will do what he can towards removing from Mr. Coppell's mind the impression of injury which he may have done to that gentleman. I have the honor to be, Sir,
Your obedient Servant, William H. Seward
Department of State, Washington, D. C., 27th of June 1862
The Honorable Reverdy Johnson, New Orleans, Louisiana
Sir: The President regards the renewal of commerce at New Orleans, and on the Mississippi and its tributaries, as a most effective means of bringing this unhappy civil strife to an end, and restoring the authority of the Federal Government. Such a restoration of trade is also calculated to deprive foreign powers of all excuse for sympathy with the insurgents. Under these circumstances, he deeply regrets every case of collision that occurs, even unavoidably, between the military authorities at New Orleans and the Consuls, merchants, and others concerned in commerce. While he will in all cases maintain the national rights, he desired to protect and guard the national honor in intercourse with foreign nations.
A correspondence between Major General Butler, and the Consuls of Great Britain, France, and Greece in regard to a certain quantity of sugars claimed by certain British, French and Grecian merchants has been brought to the notice of this Department through a report of Major General Butler, made to the Secretary of War.
The President desires and authorizes you, in addition to the special duties already assigned to you, to examine into the merits of that transaction, and to report the facts thereupon to this department, to the end that justice may be done in the matter.
The carrying this instruction into effect may detain you at New Orleans longer than was anticipated, but the importance of the business makes it advisable that it should be adjusted prior to your departure. I am sir,
Your obedient servant, William H. Seward"
"June 29, 1862","Headquarters, Department of the Gulf, New Orleans, June 29th, 1862
Hon. Edwin M. Stanton, Secretary of War
Sir: I am on my return from Baton Rouge, where I have been for the purpose of inspecting the Garrison and ascertaining if possible what is the sentiment of the people toward the Government.
The Garrison, consisting of two regiments 21st Indiana and the 6th Michigan Volunteers, with a section of Everett's Battery (6th Mass.), are in fine condition and health, and, I believe, strong enough to resist a threatened attack by General Van Dorn, who has been put in command of the Department of the Mississippi in place of General Lovell, removed.
I have been agreeably disappointed in the feeling at Baton Rouge. There is a tiredness of the war and longing for the restoration of the old state of things, under the Union, which is gratifying. I had a visit from a dozen or more gentlemen of Baton Rouge and vicinity, representing some five or six millions of property, and had conversation with them upon the new system of Partisan Rangers just now inaugurated, i. e. Guerilla Warfare. They depreceate it, and will do everything possible to discountenance it.
They offered to take the oath of allegiance if I required, but assured me they thought they could do more good by abstaining from that oath for the present, because it would be impossible for them to have communication with these partisans if they took the oath, and it should be publicly known.
Governor Moore has issued an address more remarkable than any document of the kind ever penned. I enclose a copy.
At the same time, General Van Dorn has issued his General Order No. 1, which recommends that all inhabitants remove eight miles from the river. I brought before me some of the most violent of the rebels, and after calling their attention to the present state of things, I proposed to them the oath of allegiance, and after consideration over night, two of them, Mr. Benjamin, brother of the rebel Secretary of War, and Byam, the Mayor of the City, took the oath.
I brought away with me and now have under arrest five of those who had used threats toward the men who had shown themselves favorable to the Union.
Upon full reflection and observation I find the condition of public sentiment to be this:
The planters and men of property are now tired of the war, well-disposed toward the Union, only fearing lest their negroes should not be let alone, would be quite happy to have the Union restored in all things.
The operative classes of white men of all trades are as a rule in favor of the Union.
In fact, this rebellion was at first inaugurated for the purpose of establishing a landed aristocracy as against the poor and middling whites, who had shown some disposition to assert their equality with the planter, and had begun to express themselves through organizations and on the basis of the Masonic Order into societies, of which the South is full, of which that ritual is the pattern. This disinclination of the people to the war has required the Conscription act, so that we now have the before unheard of fact of a people professedly fighting for their liberties against oppression, and obliged to do so by their leaders in a most rigid Conscription Act.
Free Conscripts are certainly evidence of progress in terms.
I have directed all the funds in the several banks belonging to the State of Louisiana to be sequestered and held for the disposition of the Government. They are all collected in Confederate Treasury notes, and so may not be very valuable.
By some unfortunate oversight the Paymasters came down here with $285,000 too little money to pay the troops up to last of May. Some of them have not been paid for six months, and some not since they have been in service, nine months. Men were disheartened; the Mails brought intelligence of the destitution of their families. Two months' more pay come due July 1st.
In this emergency, specie seized and which by the direction of a Commission was to be sent to Washington, in amount $50,000, was taken by pledge of personal credit and the faith of the Government a hundred thousand dollars more, which will be paid out to the suffering soldiers.
Major Locke, one of the Paymasters, has also been ordered to report to Washington to get funds to pay the allotment, and for the July payment which ought to be made at once, may I ask that his mission be speeded at once? Details are given in a note to the Secretary of the Treasury, a duplicate of which is enclosed.
The question of how to feed the people of this City and
the surrounding country becomes of the utmost magnitude, and to it I have given the best exertions.
Owing to the impression at the North that the river was opened, no flour has been shipped from Northern Ports. It is now at a fabulous price. Moore's proclamation has frightened all the people from the Red River County from sending the flour here, and we are in danger of starving.
Upon consultation with Col. Turner, Chief Commissary of Subsistence, it has been thought best to distribute gratuitously under proper safeguard the Flour and Beef we can spare, say 2000 barrels of each.
The leading Secessionists will be taxed to pay the expenses, which I set down at about $75,000. It is absolutely necessary that a fast-sailing steamer, capable of containing 4000 Bbls. of Flour, Beef, & Pork, be at once forwarded for the use of the City. Col. Turner has made the necessary requisition for the flour, 4000 Bbls.
The trustees for the Charity Hospital have resigned, but have been continued in office, as will be seen by the enclosed correspondence."
"July 3, 1862","A boat from Vicksburg this morning brings news (but no official despatches) that there has been an attack upon the place, that a portion of the fleet have got by the Batteries and joined fleet of Commander Davis above, that General Williams has made a lodgment on the opposite Bank of the River and erected a Battery there, and with his rifle(d) 12 pounders is throwing shells into the town and enemy's camp. This is the rebels' last defense on the river, and must yield.
We are threatened with a Guerilla War which is claimed will be interminable. I take leave to suggest that it can be terminated in a few days. A reward offered of a $1000 for each Guerilla head and freedom to the Negro who should bring it in, would bring that uncivilized system of war fare to a sudden termination by an equally uncivilized remedy. ""Fire set to fight fire.""
I am sorry to say that some of the stories about the unhumane acts of our enemies are true. Insults to the dead are too shocking to be tolerated.
I hope all those who have whined over Order No. 28 will read the Order which I have felt it my duty to enforce in the cases of Mrs. Phillips, Keller, & Andrew, copies I enclose.
I beg leave to call attention to my call for more troops, I have enough to hold all I have occupied, but if the ulterior
movements in Texas and upon Mobile are to be carried out, more will be required.
Col. Deming again returns home for reasons which he prays leave to explain to the Department, and is charged with some personal communication to which I pray attention.
I am deeply gratified, as indeed are all the loyal citizens of New Orleans, to learn that Acting Brig. Gen. Shepley has been made Military Governor of Louisiana. His successful administration of the City affairs has rendered him very acceptable. It will be necessary to give him a Commission as Brigadier General so that he may be able to command the troops detailed to him to guard the State.
Very Respectfully, Your obedient Servant,
Benj. F. Butler, Maj. Gen. Comdg."
"June 18, 1862","Opelousas, June 18, 1862
Address to the People of Louisiana
The occupation by the enemy of a portion of the territory of our State imposes upon us new and unaccustomed responsibilities. It creates an anomalous condition of affairs, and establishes between the Citizens of New Orleans and all other of our towns in the actual occupation of the enemy, and those of the Country Parishes, relations very different from those which regulate their ordinary intercourse. It is not surprising that a people who are now experiencing the first invasion of their State should not at the outset have appreciated the duties and necessities of the new position in which they suddenly find themselves placed.
New Orleans is the Commercial Depot of the State. To it the whole agricultural products of our soil are conveyed, and from it are brought in return a large measure of the supplies for our plantations and the merchandise which forms the object of every species of traffic.
The channels of trade constantly flow between it and the Country freighted with the every-day transactions of all classes of our citizens, thus binding our urban and rural population together by the strong bands of mutual dependence and reciprocal benefit.
Trade with the Enemy forbidden
A state of public war resulting in the armed occupancy of New Orleans by the enemy, changes these relations.
There cannot be a war for arms and a peace for trade between two people at the same time.
The armed occupants of that city are our enemies.
To each loyal Citizen of Louisiana and of the Confederacy, every citizen of the country hostile to us is an enemy. We cannot barter our products for theirs. We cannot exchange our corn, cattle, sugar, or cotton for their gold. We have even no right to pay money that was owing to the citizens of the now hostile States before the war.
Absolutely non-intercourse, the entire suspension of communication by visit or for trade, is the only safe rule for our guidance. It is a rule recognized as imperative by all writers on public law, and universally administered by the authorities of nations at war. Communications with Citizens of occupied Cities must cease.
Nor is it prudent to hold communication with citizens of any portion of our territory, temporarily occupied by the enemy. However much we may deplore their misfortunes, we must not permit these to be made the instruments for our further damage.
The only proper and permissible manner in which we can communicate with the enemy or those under his control who are within his lines, is under a flag of truce. Communication with New Orleans since its armed occupation has been almost unrestrained, save by the fears of those who desired, from motives either of gain or curiosity, to enter the lines of the enemy.
This communication must cease and at once. It is well-known that the General Commanding the invading army opposes no obstacle to the ingress of any of our citizens into New Orleans, but invariably attaches to the passport for egress the statement: ""This Pass is given upon the parole of honor of the holder, that he will in no way give information, countenance, aid, or support to the so-called Confederate States or Government.""
This cunningly-devised trap to catch the unsuspicious visitors was expected to trammel him in the rendition of those services which his country demands. No parole is ever given when these passports are delivered -- none ever required. This condition is inserted in the passport without notification to the applicant that it is to be required, in the belief that the apparent tacit consent of the receiver to a condition thus sneakingly sought to be foisted upon him, would be held binding in morals and in conscience.
At first the passports were received unsuspectingly and without knowledge of the characteristic trickery contained in this clause, but it is now well-known that none are given without it.
Using the Enemy's passports
Whoever now, therefore, voluntarily place himself in the power of the enemy by entering their lines, throws a shade upon his loyalty to his Government. The possession of a passport containing the clause above quoted subjects the holder to grave suspicion. Its receipt is incipient neutrality, the desire to fulfill the condition assumed to be imposed is only disguised indifference to our success. The attempt to fulfill it is treachery to our cause. No man can pretend to assimilate this ex parte declaration of a Federal Provost Marshal, to which no assent is made by parole or act, to the parole of honor well recognized in military usage, the observance of which must ever be regarded as a primary duty. Such paroles are given to, are received by prisoners on either side, that they will not resume their participation in hostilities until exchanged, and by persons sent from out the lines that they will not reveal what their presence has enabled them to see or hear.
Neither the citizens of New Orleans or those visitors who have gone there since the occupation of the enemy are regarded by him as prisoners of War. If prisoners, it is his manifested duty to feed them, and when permitted to depart from his lines he would require of them a parole to cease hostilities, until exchanged.
The passport shall not be a shelter from duty. It has come to my knowledge that some persons have gone into New Orleans voluntarily, and without any apparent or avowed purpose to accomplish, save the gratification of an idle curiosity, and have since returned with these Passports. When required to perform Militia duty afterwards, or accosted by the enrollment Officer of Conscript, they present the Passport in which a Federal Officer has assumed a promise that the holder will not countenance or aid this Government. If the does not countenance then he must necessarily recognize the pretension of those who seek to crush it. Nor can he separate one part of the pretended parole from the other.
He cannot claim that he holds himself bound by the stipulation not to give aid and support to this Government, and thus avoid military duty, without also confessing to an obligation not to countenance it, which is treason unmasked.
The military officer will be charged with Orders on this subject, the rigorous execution of which will be required. The Confederacy and the State recognize but two classes -- its friends and its foes. In this mighty and awful struggle for our sacred rights, for the sanctity of our homes, for the enjoyment of liberty for the salvation of our country, all considerations of blood and friendship must give way, all apprehensions for the safety of property must be disregarded. Obedience to the laws and acquiescence to the policy of the Government will be the cheerful homage that every true man will make. Those who are not true must be deprived of the power of harm.
Spies, Salaried Iuformers & Tories
Not the least evil of the consequences flowing from communications by our citizens with the places occupied by the enemy is the facility it affords to spies who traverse the country through the negligence of officers or the unsuspicious security of the people. These spies communicate with the salaried informers who are to be found in some localities, ready to serve any master for gold.
The world has never furnished an instance of a people renouncing their Government and establishing a new one with the unanimity which has characterized the people of the Confederate States. Not even the men of '76, those fore-fathers whom we are accustomed to think of battling with undivided hearts for a severance from the crown and the independence of their nation, approached nearer to perfect unanimity than ourselves in struggle against a foe, more malignant and vindictive than the one confronted by them. In the revolt of the colonies, whole Districts were inhabited by Tories, who strove to throttle the infant liberties of their country and bind her by fetters to the throne. In our struggle they are rarely to be met, but, though very few in number, they exist, and with a hate of our Government not exceeded by the hate of their predecessors to the government of George Washington.
They can be tolerated no longer; if they did not wish to live under the Confederate Government, they were warned by its President a year ago that they were at liberty to depart. They have made their option. They cannot live here and disregard our laws. They can neither hold property nor enjoy liberty if they disown the Government which protects the one and insures the other. This would be true even in ordinary circumstances, but when the foe who aims at our subjugation
is pressing our soil, short must be the shrift of those who stand ready to welcome him.
All possible vigilance must therefore be exercised for the detection of these spies and salaried informers, and for their apprehension. All citizens should report to the nearest authorities the names and the proof or grounds of suspicion.
Nor must less rigor be enforced in the case of those persons who have not obeyed the President's warning. Strangers must give a satisfactory account of themselves, the doubtful must be closely watched, the disloyal must be imprisoned, and when found guilty of treason must be held liable to the penalty due to that capital crime.
Confederate Notes the currency of our Country
Manifold are the inducements presented by the enemy to begin trading with him. As temptation to you to thus violate your sacred duty as citizens of the Confederate States, he offers high prices for your products, which he promises to pay in gold and silver. With equal assiduity he is engaged in efforts to depreciate the currency of your country. He forgets that every Confederate Bond is a record and certificate of a sum that has been contributed by generous and confiding citizens to secure the independence of their country -- that every Confederate Note is the evidence that thus much of the wealth of the people has been loaned to the Government to help it in its struggle -- that all the resources of a Republic of ten millions of people, occupying a vast territory of unsurpassed productiveness, are pledged for their redemption -- that they constitute a currency that measures the value of all our property, and that custom and loyalty recognize them as a legal tender. They are received and paid as such by all patriots, in exchange for what he offers for sale. The refusal to take Confederate money does a direct injury to our sacred cause, fans the latent spark of treason, and gives indirect aid and comfort to the ruthless enemy who invades our soil ravages our coasts, insults our mothers, wives, and daughters, and tyrannizes over our conquered cities. The refusal to take Confederate money, if general, would at once paralyze our Government and put the Confederacy in imminent peril. Such refusal affords a presumption of disloyalty, and the plea of ignorance is but a slight palliation of the grave offence.
River Steam Boats for Transports
The enemy needs river steamboats to transport his troops to their plundering expeditions along the Mississippi, and he
seizes all that lie within his reach; he searches for them in Bayous seldom navigated, and by the aid of traitorous informers, he has succeeded in capturing those that were thought to be effectually hidden.
This must be prevented at any cost. As no concealment can be depended on, the Boats must be destroyed whenever the near approach of the enemy shall leave no other means of preventing their capture.
Supplies of Provisions for New Orleans
The delicate question of permitting New Orleans to be supplied with provisions, while in the occupation of the enemy, was presented to me soon after my return from Camp Moore, whither I had gone for the purpose of concerting Richmond plans for the future which will soon be made manifest.
Much was and is to be said for and against the policy. It is sufficient for my present purpose to say that I have given permits to two agents of the City to carry provisions to our citizens so long as the Federal General should faithfully observe his pledge not to appropriate any of the provisions to other uses than supplying the wants of our own people. I was not unaware of the danger that attended such a policy in affording advantages for the establishment of an intercourse which the previous part of this address will show I could not approve. But I did not suspect that such a concession, made in tender consideration of the pressing wants of the City, would be abused by any of its own citizens to the extent of committing an act, little short of affording direct aid to the enemy. The recent act of the Cashier of the Bank of America and his accomplices has convinced me that any departure from this rule that the necessities of the population of any locality must be held subservient to the paramount consideration of the public safety, is attended with peril, and that in my desire to relieve the people of New Orleans, I was subjecting the public interests to danger of injury. No boats will hereafter be permitted to go down to New Orleans or Baton Rouge, while those places are occupied by the enemy, unless, after the arrival of the Commanding General, Confederate Officers should be detailed for the purpose of going in charge of them in the manner usually practiced by belligerents.
Continued resistance our paramount duty
It is not proper for obvious reasons to state here in detail the measures I have taken and the plans devised for the defense of our homes. The loss of New Orleans and the opening
of the Mississippi, which will soon follow, have greatly increased our danger and deprived us of many resources for defense. With less means we have more to do than before. Every weapon we have and all that our skillful mechanics can make will be needed. Every able-bodied citizen will hold himself in readiness for immediate service. Brave, vigilant, energetic officers are authorized to raise bands of Partisan Rangers. Let every possible assistance be rendered them in forming, arming, equipping, and mounting their companies, and in giving them support and information when in service. Let every citizen be an armed sentinel to give warning of any approach of the insolent foe. Let all our River banks swarm with armed patriots, to teach the hated invader that the rifle will be his only welcome on his errands of plunder and destruction. Wherever he dares to raise the hated emblem of tyranny, tear it down and rip it in tatters.
Mumford the Martyr
The noble heroism of the patriot Mumford has placed his name high on the list of our martyr sons. When the Federal navy reached New Orleans a squad of Marines was sent on shore who hoisted their flag on the Mint. The City was not occupied by the United States Troops, nor had they reached there. The place was not in their possession.
William B. Mumford pulled down the detested symbol with his own hands, and for that was condemned to be hung by General Butler after his arrival. Brought in full view of the scaffold, his murderers hoped to appal his heroic soul by the exhibition of the implements of an ignominious death. With the evidence of their determination to consummate their brutal purpose before his eyes, they offered him life on condition that he would abjure his country and swear allegiance to her foe. He spurned the offer, scorning to stain his soul with such foul dishonor. He met his fate courageously, and has transmitted to his countrymen a fresh example of what men will do and dare when under the inspiration of fervid patriotism. I shall not forget the outrage of his murder, nor shall it pass unnoticed.
Rules that will not be relaxed
I am not introducing any new regulations for the conduct of our citizens, but am only placing before them those that every nation at War recognizes as necessary and proper to be enforced. It is needless therefore to say that they will not be relaxed.
On the contrary I am but awaiting the assistance and presence of the General appointed to the Department to inaugurate the most effectual method for their enforcement. It is well to repeat them.
Trading with the enemy is prohibited under all circumstances. Traveling to and from New Orleans and other places, occupied by the enemy is forbidden -- all passengers will be arrested.
Citizens going to these places and returning with the enemy's usual passport will be arrested. Conscripts or Militia men having in possession such passport, seeking to shun duty under the pretext of a parole, shall be treated as public enemies. No such papers will be held sufficient excuse for inaction by any Citizen.
The utmost vigilance must be used by officers and citizens in the detection of Spies and salaried informers and their apprehension, promptly effected. Tories must suffer the fate that every betrayer of his country deserves.
Confederate notes shall be received and used as the currency of the country.
River Steamboats must in no case be permitted to be captured. Burn them when they cannot be saved.
Provisions may be conveyed to New Orleans only in Charge of Confederate Officers, and under the precautionary regulations governing communication between belligerents.
Our struggle and its sure result
The loss of New Orleans, bitter humiliation as it was, has not created despondency, nor shaken our abiding faith in our success. Not to the eye of the enthusiastic patriot alone, who might be expected to color events with his hopes, but to the more impassioned gaze of the statesman, that success was certain from the beginning. It is only the timid, the unreflecting, and the property owner who thinks more of his possessions than his country, that will succumb to the depressing influence of disaster. The great heart of the people has swelled with more intense aspirations for the cause, the more it seemed to totter. Their confidence is well-founded. The possession by the enemy of our seaboard and main water courses ought to have been foreseen by us. His overwhelming naval force necessarily, accomplished the same results attained by the British in their war of subjugation. The final result will be the same. Let us turn unheeding ears to the rumors of foreign intervention. To believe is to rely on them.
We must rely on ourselves. Our recognition as a Nation is one of those certainties of the future which nothing but our own unfaithfulness can prevent. We must not look around for friends to help when the enemy is straight before us. Help yourselves, it is the great instrument of national as of individual success.

Fidel Keller has been found exhibiting a human Skeleton in his Book Store window in a public place in this City, labelled ""Chickahominy,"" in large letters, meaning and intending that the bones should be taken by the populace to be the bones of an United States soldier slain in that battle, in order to bring the authority of the U.

In the matter of the appeal of W. N. Mercer, President, and Auguste Montreuil, Cashier, of the Bank of Louisiana, defendants, from the judgment of the Provost Court, upon the complaint of A. Durand, complainant.
This is an application by the defendants, representing the Bank, made to the General Commanding, asking him to revise and set aside the judgment of the Provost Court, made in favor of the Plantiff, Durand.
It is based upon the legal theory that over all matters within garrison, camp, and perhaps geographical military department, wherein martial law has been declared, the power of the Commanding General is absolute, and that, looking to him as the representative of the martial power of the government here, all applications for redress must be made when any wrong is supposed to have been done.
This view being sound, so far as I can see, I have with the best thoughts possible under the circumstances re-examined the case and the reasons assigned for the appeal.
Error is claimed on two grounds, first, that the Provost Court had no jurisdiction of the cause, and second, that the judgment was not in accordance with the law which should govern its decision.
The argument assumes that law to be Genl. Order No. 30, and does not dispute the authority which made it, or the effect of that order, but contents itself with endeavouring to construe the order.
The objection to the jurisdiction of the Court is put upon two grounds -- first, that the Provost Court has not jurisdiction of the subject matter, second, that the proper parties were not before it so as to enable it to act with regard to the rights of those, who were not summoned in the case.
It is said that the question, being one of a right of property cannot be entertained by a Court which only acts to punish the infraction of military orders and police regulations.
A technical answer to this objection, which is in the nature
of a plea to the jurisdiction, would be that it does not appear this plea was put in till after the hearing upon the merits.
It is a familiar rule that a party shall not be allowed to go into Court, and have a hearing on his case, take the chances of a decision in his favor, and then, if adverse, repudiate the Court before which he has appeared, and to whose judgment he has submitted his cause.
This rule has been held very strictly, both as to jurisdiction over the subject matter and the parties.
But in a Court where no technical rules are allowed to work injustice, a technical answer is not sufficient.
Of what then do the defendants complain? The Bank says the Court has made an order which takes away the property of the Bank, and gives it to another, and that the Court has no power so to act. But is that so? Is it not the Commanding General's order, which does that of which complaint is made? The Bank nowhere complains that the General has not the power to make such an order, if, in his judgment, it becomes a military necessity, and that some order on the subject matter was so is shown by the fact that the first question put to him on entering the city was, what currency would be provided for the people to save them from starvation and bread riots.
It has passed into history that he permitted a vicious currency as a medium of circulation for the purpose of meeting this exigency. Again, it will be remembered that the Bank now claims that it is exempted from this order, because, by order of another Military Commander in September last (there was no civil law for it), it was obliged to suspend Specie Payment against its will, and substitute Confederate notes for its daily currency instead of its own bills. This order was submitted to if not with joy, at least not under protest, so far as I am informed.
The order, as well as the law of the land then is, that the Bank shall pay its depositors in Gold or Silver coin, and United States Treasury Notes, or its own bills. A citizen complains that this order of the Commanding General has not been obeyed to his prejudice.
For what, then, is a Provost Court, in Military phrase constituted? Confessedly, to inquire into, determine, and punish the infraction of military orders.
To do this the court must act in rem as well as in personam. A familiar example would be, if the Commanding General
orders all arms to be given up, and some citizen neglects or refuses to obey, would it not be within the jurisdiction of a Provost Court, although its judgment should act upon a right of property involving millions of dollars worth of muskets?
If the act brought before the Court, therefore, is alleged to be an infraction of a military order, it is determinable in a military Court.
Again, it is said, that the Court has not jurisdiction, because, the stockholders of the Bank were not summoned in and made parties and that their rights and interests will be affected by this decision. This is all true. But did the learned Counsel for the Bank ever hear of a suit against a bank in any Court, where the stockholders were summoned in, unless it was sought to charge them, individually, which is not the case here.
A corporation acts through its authorized agents, and is bound by their acts, and is to be charged upon notice to them. This objection of want of sufficient power in the President and Directors of the Bank of Louisiana to pay the depositor, M. Durand, in their own bills, which is only changing the form of indebtedness from a depositor to a billholder, under the order of the Provost Court, without the consent of their stockholders, would provoke a smile in a less serious discussion, when we remember that this same Board of Directors, without asking leave of their stockholders, against law and right, put 3,000,000 of its bullion out of their hands and out of the State, whence they will probably never see it again.
I am of opinion that these objections to the jurisdiction of the Court, are untenable.
The other objection as to the merits of the decision can, it seems to me, be disposed of in a word. If the order is a proper one, it must be obeyed. Its propriety cannot be discussed by me. It is admitted that Durand is a depositor in the Bank of what the Bank chose to take as money -- treated as money -- credited to him as money -- nay forced upon the community as money. He has not been paid his deposit.
The Bank should pay him in specie. The decision following the letter of the order, is that the Bank may give him their own bills instead of money. Of that decision the Bank has no cause to complain. Durand is now the creditor of the Bank as a depositor. The decision makes him their creditor as a billholder. In equity they have nothing to complain of, he may have, because he does not get his gold, to which by the
laws of banking, laws of the State and the United States he is entitled.
He does not seek to reverse the decision. Let it stand.

In view of the great distress now existing in New Orleans, an attempt to relieve it will be made on the following plan:
I. There shall be one Superintendent, with entire control, under the direction of the General Commanding the Department. He shall have the custody of all monies appropriated to the subsistence of the poor of the city, and shall be charged with the purchase of all provisions for the poor of New Orleans, and with the distribution of the same.
A Return of Provisions received and issued, and the disbursements on account of purchases of subsistence, and expenses incurred in distributing, with an account of all monies received, will be rendered monthly with vouchers to the Headquarters of the Department.
II. There shall be an Asst. Superintendent for each district of the City, appointed by the Superintendent, whose pay shall be three Dollars per day. It will be his duty to collect all informations of the poor and needy within his district, and to give orders to those who are in want upon the District depot for provisions. These orders shall be in Duplicate, one or which is retained and accompanies his return of donations, which he makes up daily to the Superintendent. He will also give orders for the sale of provisions under instruction from the Superintendent.
Cases of destitution shall be certified to either by a Clergyman of the District, by a responsible person known to the Asst. Superintendent, by personal observation, or by other satisfactory evidence to prevent imposition.
III. There shall be in each district of the City a Depot of Supplies for distribution and Sales. There shall be attached to each as it may be found necessary, a Salesman in charge of the Depot at $2.50 per day, one Asst. at $2.00 per day, and two Assts. at $1.50 pr day, each to be appointed by the Superintendent. The Salesman will receive orders from the Asst. Superintendent of his District, and see that they are promptly
filled. He will render an Account daily to the Superintendent of all provisions expended, whether by donations or sales, accompanied by the orders of the Asst. Superintendent, which shall be his vouchers for the issues of the purchases distributed, as also an account of the monies received. He will make his requisitions for provisions upon the Superintendent.
Stores properly located will be occupied for these purposes, taking those vacant and belonging to known enemies of the Country.

Sir: Will be found enclosed herewith minutes of the doings of a Commission to enquire into the seizure of the Specie of Samuel Smith & Co. The finding is that the Case should be sent to the Department for investigation. I should have sent the specie ($50,000) to you, but this remarkable state of things exists.
Two Paymasters came down here with $285,000 too little money to pay the troops of this Department, some of whom have not been paid for six months, and they and their families are suffering for their just dues; which from the inefficiency of the Pay Department in not making proper requisition has not been furnished them. I shall therefore appropriate this $50,000 toward the payment of the troops left unpaid, one of which is a Western Regiment not paid since December, and one a Maine one, not paid since October.
I shall borrow of one of the Banks here $50,000 more in gold. I cannot get Treasury notes upon my own credit and pledging the faith of the Government.
This I have promised shall be returned in gold in sixty days, with interest at the rate of six per cent per annum, and trust that pledge will be made good, as I shall have to suffer the loss.
I shall also obtain from Adams & Co. here $50,000 in Treasury notes, or thereabouts, and by leaving the allotments unpaid here but to be paid in New York, I shall be able to have the payment completed.
But this only pays the March payment, leaving two months still due. May I ask therefore that my draft in favor of Adams & Co. be honored, and a future draft not exceeding in all $50,000, be honored at sight, so that Adams & Co. can send forward the remittances to the soldiers' wives, which have been used here to pay others, and that $50,000 in gold be sent me to repay that which I have borrowed.
I could not let my soldiers go longer unpaid. It was injuring the credit of the Government with our foes and breeding sickness and discontent among my men.

My dear Sir: Many thanks for your kind note. You will have seen by my last note that I have endeavored to protect my drafts. I assure you that they would be paid at sight if here now. Therefore, do not let them be dishonored. Hildreth and Fay will aid in the matter.
I am as jealous of the good opinion of my friends as I am careless of the slanders of my enemies, and your kind expression in regard to order No. 28, leads me to say a word to you on the subject.
That it ever could have been so misconceived as it has been by some portion of the Northern Press is wonderful, and would lead one to exclaim with the Jew, ""O Father Abraham, what these Christians are, whose own hard dealings teach them to suspect the very thoughts of others.""
What was the state of things to which the women order applied? We were two thousand five hundred men in a city seven miles long by two to four wide, of a hundred and fifty thousand inhabitants, all hostile, bitter, defiant, explosive, standing literally in a magazine, a spark only needed for destruction. The devil had entered into the hearts of the women of this town to stir up strife in every way possible. Every opprobrious epithet, every insulting question was made by these bejewelled, becrinolined, and laced creatures calling themselves ladies, toward my soldiers and officers, from the windows of houses and in the street. How long do you suppose our flesh and blood could have stood this without retort? That would lead to disturbance and riot from which we must clear the streets by artillery, and then a howl that we had murdered these fine women. I had arrested the men who hurrahed for Beauregard, -- could I arrest the women? No -- what was to be done? No order could be made save one that would execute itself. With anxious, careful thought I hit upon this, ""Women who insult my soldiers are
to be regarded and treated as common women plying their vocation.""
Pray how do you treat a common woman plying her vocation in the streets? You pass her by unheeded. She cannot insult you. As a gentleman you can and will take no notice of her. If she speaks, her words are not opprobrious. It is only when she becomes a continuous and positive nuisance that you call a watchman and give her in charge to him.
But some of the Northern Editors seem to think that whenever one meets such a woman one must stop her, talk with her, insult her, or hold dalliance with her. And so from their own conduct they construed my order. The Editor of the Boston Courier may so deal with common women, and out of the abundance of the heart his mouth may speak, but so do not I.
Why, these she-adders of New Orleans themselves were at once shamed into propriety of conduct by the order, and from that day no woman has either insulted or annoyed my line soldiers or officers, and of a certainty no soldier has insulted any woman. When I passed through Baltimore on the 23rd of February last, members of my staff were insulted by the gestures of the ladies there. Not so in New Orleans. One of the worst possible of all these women showed disrespect to the remains of gallant young De Kay, and you will see her punishment, a copy of the order for which I enclose is at once a vindication and a construction of my order.
I can only say that I would issue it again under like circumstances. Again thanking you for your kind interest, I am

Special Order No. 150
Mrs. Philipps, wife of Philipp Philipps, having been once imprisoned for her traitorous proclivities and acts at Washington, and released by the clemency of the Government, and having been found training her children to spit upon the Officers of the United States at New Orleans, for which act of one of those children both her husband and herself apologized and were again forgiven, is now found on the balcony of her house during the passage of the funeral procession of Lieut.
DeKay, laughing and mocking at his remains, and, upon being inquired of by the Com'd'g General, if this fact were so, contemptuously replies, ""I was in good spirits that day.""
It is therefore ordered that she be not ""regarded and treated as a common woman."" of whom no officer or soldier is bound to take notice, but as an uncommon, bad, and dangerous woman, stirring up strife and inciting to riot.
And that therefore she be confined at Ship Island in the State of Mississippi, within proper limits there, till further orders, and that she be allowed one female servant and no more, if she so choose. That one of the houses for Hospital purpose be assigned her as quarters, and a soldier's ration each day be served out to her with the means of cooking the same, and that no verbal or written communication be allowed with her except through this office, and that she be kept in close confinement until removed to Ship Island.

"July 2, 1862","Cambridge, July 2, 1862
Maj. Gen. B. F. Butler, New Orleans
My dear General: I arrived in New York on the eighteenth of June without anything of importance occurring on the passage. Before reaching the city a messenger came on board and handed me a letter, stating that, by direction from Washington, the State prisoners were to go directly to Fort Luforth and not to Warren, also that they must be permitted to communicate with no one. I went on shore and found telegrams to that effect at the Quarter Master's and the United States Marshal. I then took them to the Marshal's office, together with their baggage, and took his receipt for them as voucher. That occupied my day, and Mrs. Butler not being very well from her seasickness, I proceeded that night with her to Boston, and left her the next morning in the Lowell depot, spending that night in Cambridge. The next day I started for Washington and arrived there sick, and was obliged to take my bed for some time. When I delivered my despatches, from what I could learn from the Secretary of War's talk, and he talked very freely, he is highly pleased with everything you have done. As I left him he said you desired me appointed Captain, and asked me if I would call the next day, which I
did, when he made an appointment certainly very satisfactory, and ordered me to report to you for duty but to come to Washington when I was ready to return. I told him I would, but for the present I was not fit for duty, and should go North, and when I could work would return. Secretary Chase seems greatly pleased with your policy, but wants to know how you get along with the negroes, and said it was a hard and troublesome question. I told him you had asked instructions with regard to it but had received none as yet. I met him in the evening at Mr. Seward's house, and he told me he had written you after our talk on the subject, though it was not his place to write, but gave you his views in an advisory note.
I sent in my card to Mr. Seward and was admitted and met very cordially, and he seemed, to know all about me in the Consul matters, and said he was of the opinion that I could not search the Consul's person. I asked him what he would have done with a stout vault and the men with a key in front of it. He said the Consul had no more right with regard to property than anyone else, and that I might have torn down his house and blown his vault to pieces, but he thought I could not touch his person. He hoped we should make him out as good a case as possible to stand on. He looks upon all of the Consul questions as very delicate ones, and spoke of the Trent matter as one we liad to back out from. My impression is that he is quite timid about the whole matter touching the Consuls, and I think he will instruct you with regard to them. He had seen in the paper that you require the Consuls to take an oath -- he says he does not think you can make them do that. I state these things to give you an idea of what I heard. Sometimes he seemed highly pleased with what you had done for the repression of the rebellion in the South. After I had talked with him a short time he said, ""Mr. Kinsman, I want you to dine with me today at seven o'clock."" Although I was quite unwell, I thought it would not do to decline, and accepted. Went back to Willard's and went to bed, and at seven went up and found it to be a Diplomatic dinner to the English and French Legation, together with the Colonists Secretaries, making twenty in all. When he took occasion to introduce me as your actor and the officer that picks the foreign Consul's pockets, and that they should have a care for me. As a modest man, you must know my suffering, though I got well over it before rising from the table. We sat
down at seven and arose at ten, very glad to go back to Willard's to bed again. The next day I went to Georgetown to see Blanche and Florence, and got them ready to start the next day (Thursday last) for home, where we all went on Friday night. I was not well on the way home, and since reaching your house I have been in bed until yesterday. Then I came down here to Cambridge, and as soon as I am good for anything I will return to you. I am Sir,
Very truly, Your obt. servt., J. B. Kinsman"

Dear Major Strong: I received your very welcome note four or five days ago, but could not answer it immediately as I wished, for the reason that I have been ill, and my eyes were so much inflamed I did not like to use them. I have rallied for the fourth, and we are preparing a holiday for the children. Mr. Butler wrote me to have the punch bowl filled, and to be sure that all drank to the absent one. Tomorrow the General and Staff were to meet in Lowell, to celebrate the day and to talk over the campaign, which, alas! is not yet finished.
It gives me great pleasure to hear that your health is so much improved. I dreaded the sea voyage for you, but felt that anything was preferable to that climate, yet if I had thought the ""Ocean Queen"" would have sailed so soon, I
should have urged you to wait a week longer. I desired so much to accompany you that at least you might have what little care and attention I could bestow.
Poor young Clark, thin as a shadow, came on with us. I really think we have saved his life by taking him away and bringing him home to his mother.
I must congratulate Mrs. Strong that she has got you home again (though sadly wasted by the climate), yet without the loss of a limb. You remember at the Revere House, on the night we started, she almost thought she would be willing to compromise with the loss of an arm. I dare not think of the summer for Mr. Butler, but am hoping every hour some lucky chance will send him home. If the news we get today of McClellan's defeat should be true I shall despair on every side.
The paragraph so kindly sent I enclosed in a letter to Mr. Butler. He cannot fail to fully appreciate the nice sense of honor that dictated the article, as well as the very handsome compliment paid him in conclusion.
When you have enjoyed the quiet of your own family for a time, and breathed ""the pure air"" till you feel strong enough to bear the society of friends, you must take Mrs. Strong and the baby and visit me at Lowell. Suit your convenience as to the time, only send me a line when you feel able to come.

General: I wrote you last under date of the 29th ultimo, and have now to say that your despatch of the 18th ultimo, with the accompanying report of General Phelps concerning certain fugitive negroes that have come to his pickets -- has been considered by the President.
He is of opinion that, under the law of Congress, they cannot be sent back to their masters; that in common humanity they must not be permitted to suffer for want of food, shelter, or other necessaries of life: that, to this end, they should be provided for by the Quartermaster's and Commissary's Departments; and that those who are capable of labor should be set to work and paid reasonable wages.
In directing this to be done, the President does not mean, at present, to settle any general rule in respect to slaves or slavery, but simply to provide for the particular case under the circumstances in which it is now presented. I am General,
Very Respectfully, Your Obedient Servant,
Edwin M. Stanton, Secretary of War"
"July 3, 1862","Headquarters, Department of the Gulf, New Orleans, July 3rd, 1862
Hon. Edwin M. Stanton, Secretary of War
Sir: Col. Deming informs me that you would listen kindly to suggestions as to some appointments upon my Staff. It is sufficiently humiliating to have to ask that the Staff be appointed for some other Major General and then assigned to me.
Longer and as successful service as any other Major General in this war would seem to entitle me to be spared that degradation, while my life is at the hazard of the bayonet, of the enemy, the poinard of the assassin, or the malaria of the fearful climate. But the just claims of gentlemen who by faithful service have fairly earned promotion and position compels me to yield this as well as everything else given up to the country.
Lt. Col. Jonas H. French of Boston, you remember, was appointed Lieut. Col. of the 30th Mass. Regt., and then set aside by Governor Andrew. He is now Provost Marshal of New Orleans and Acting Inspector General. I wish at least his former rank could be given him.
Jos. M. Bell of Boston (late law partner of Mr. Choate) has served the country as my military Secretary and Volunteer Aid de Camp since October last, without pay or emolument save the love of well-doing for his country. He is now Provost Judge of New Orleans, and is doing most acceptably the work of judges who had an aggregate of salaries more than $20,000 per year, and doing it better than it was done before. I wish that he might have the Commission of Lieut. Colonel.
Robert S. Davis Esq. of Boston, who likewise has served as my Volunteer Aid without pay or emolument, and is now doing the arduous duty of Acting Asst. Adjt. General in the absence of Major Strong who is sick, I would ask to have made Captain and Aid de Camp.
Captain George A. Kensel of Kentucky, who was Captain
in the Quartermaster Department, promoted from the 5th Artillery and now Chief of Artillery of this Division, should at least be Lieut. Col., so that he may outrank all Commanders of Batteries over which he has charge. He is now doing the double duty of Ordnance Officer as well as Chief of Artillery.
Capt. William O. Fiske of Mass., who has been serving since 17th April 1861, and came out here in command of the finest company in the service, was set aside by Governor Andrew because he was Volunteer Aid to me. He had swam ashore at Hatteras through the surf to carry orders to the land forces when none else would attempt it. He has lost his company, is gallant, courageous, and deserving. He is now employed in the Quartermaster Department, where he is much needed, with an acting appointment. I wish that he might be made a Captain again, and assigned here to relieve Captain Bainbridge, who finds his position here somewhat unpleasant, as his mother is a resident of the neighborhood and opposed to him; a deserving young man who would do good service were he placed in a proper position.
Godfrey Weitzel of Ohio, 1st Lieut. of Engineers, one of the first scholars of West Point, afterwards instructor there; who commanded the first Company which came to Washington to watch over the life of the President at the inauguration; who fortified Fort Pickens so that it stood a bombardment without the loss of a man; one whom the Country owes as much for our success at New Orleans as any other because of his intimate knowledge of the Forts and the State: for him I beg to press that he may be appointed a Brigadier General.
There will be great need of one in the Division, and there is no abler man for it in the Country. I pray that his case may be considered. He has earned this in the field. A majority of his classmates are now Generals, Colonels, and Lieut. Colonels, and he is still a Lieutenant. This is unjust. If not possible to give him to me as Brigadier, at least let him be made Aid de Camp and Colonel. I have spoken of Lieut. Weitzel before in my dispatches.
If in anything we have done we have deserved well of the country, I pray the Secretary to give us these appointments.
All these Staff appointments will be necessary to be made to some Regular Major General and then assigned to me. I am,

Benj. F. Butler, Major General Commanding"
"July 3, 1862","Contoocook, July 3rd, 1862
My dear General: I write you as a friend (a looker-on), merely as you would see were you here. It is this, is the use of a friend.
Your shipments are all well save that all the transactions connected with your authority should be officially expressed in some way. For instance, if freight is collected in port by anyone bearing your sanction, or if goods be shipped to any port, your Quartermaster should take cognizance of the fact and communicate it to the Quartermaster, where it is going for his government. All this, by a moment's reflection, you will perceive the need of, particularly if it is going into unfriendly hands.
If you could suggest that McKim be sent to you for operations in the field, and some man sent to Boston by Quartermaster General, as Q. M. it would be better for you. No matter who the Q. M. sent, he would not be an Andrew man. Kinsman was well-received at Washington, by which all this shows how you stand there.
He will write you all the particulars I don't know, have not seen him. I am still of opinion that Seward is the power behind the throne, and a good friend of yours. Have you made of him a confidante sufficiently? He may not be all you want, I think he is all you have.
Fremont is ""snuffed out."" McClellan has been repulsed not routed. Gloom all over and a little fear is now the condition of public mind. You stand well generally, are well spoken of by the middle class, in the cars, in the barrooms, at the corners, etc., as ""the right man in the right place."" This embodies the gist of what is said and how they feel. I have not seen Strong since his return. We have had a line from him, he writes in good spirits and is getting better. His letter in the Tribune was good, full and friendly to you. You must have seen it. The army of the Potomac is the all-engrossing topic just now. General, ask for an expedition to Texas during the summer, and take Bell with you. He and you are both too good to lose. If I knew any points in particular you wanted knowledge concerning, I would try and obtain it. You must write if you want to know anything in particular. Your wife and children are well, your affairs all easy, as I understand from inquiry.
The future is still in great obscurity. No light can I discover. Three hundred thousand more men are called for. Cushing agrees now with me that Seward is the power behind the throne. Until the fight for Richmond all will be in statu quo.
My dear General, remember me to all my acquaintances there that you are on terms to do so with, and believe me, ever your watchful, and unchanged in feeling and in friendship,

Sir: Your note received Saturday removes all difficulty of personal intercourse. The withdrawal of the offensive expression is sufficient, and accepted.
Commander Hewitt, of H. B. M. Sloop of War ""Rinaldo,"" now in this harbor, informs me that he is instructed by Lord Lyons to recognize you as Acting Consul of her Majesty the Queen of Great Britain, and that Commander Hewitt does recognize you in that official character. This seems sufficient for the reestablishment of official relations.
I beg leave to correct a seeming misunderstanding that the expression of that note had anything to do with my doubts of your official character. You will remember that those doubts had been expressed before that time, and no evidence of that character had been furnished, except the superscription upon two letters directed to yourself with the address, ""Acting Consul;"" that did not seem to me sufficient.
To your inquiry whether all neutrals (British subjects) wishing to go to New York or abroad, furnished with proper passports from their Government, will be required to take the oath prescribed for aliens in General Orders, No. 41 & 42, it is answered, that a pass differs from a passport, as I had the honor to explain in my letter to the Consuls upon this subject, and that as a rule the oath would not be required. Such persons will be allowed to pass on board Ships to go abroad or to New York, whom in my judgment it is not necessary to retain here from some act either done or contemplated to be done in favor of the Confederate States, -- for example buying arms, forwarding money, or intelligence.

Our land force is too small to do anything with this place -- we passed the town on the 28th, and silenced the batteries as we came up with them, but they soon returned to them and fired on us after we had passed. We have met the squadron from above, they arrived here on the 1st., and we have been shelling the town or Forts ever since. There is no telling the force they have here; they tell so many stories about Beauregard's army being here -- some say 10 and some

Here are two quasi-public corporations, whose action in regard to the currency the Commanding General has undertaken to regulate.

If you examine your checks, you will perceive that you have drawn $7,188.37 in gold, & $252.19 Treas. notes more than is credited, and that you have a credit in Bank Notes of $5,581.75, & $1,360.00 in silver more than you have drawn when your book was last balanced.
The object of the memorandum on the first page of the new book sent you was not to elicit any implied contract or to impose any obligation -- a mere memorandum which I thought would be useful to your Clerk in balancing your own books.
The gold has arrived for your bills on Boston, leaving us no profit by the operation.
Very respectfully, Your obt. servt.,

We have rumors of attempts to be made upon Baton Rouge, and I have strengthened the force there by the addition of a regiment and Battery so that they have now
their three Regiments, 4 pieces of Artillery, & a Company of Cavalry.
This large force is sent there rather to relieve the anxieties of the Inhabitants than in any belief that it is necessary; besides it will be a good point to move from when necessary toward their interior.

Maj. Genl. Butler
My Dear Sir: I hasten to inclose a letter this morning received from a friend of Judge Andrews of New Orleans, who I presume is now at Ship Island.
Judge Andrews is a native of Boston, the son of a prominent merchant late of this City. Two of his brothers, graduates of Cambridge, have been my partners. Another brother, our Consul at Malta, was for many years a prominent, popular Democrat, & is an intimate friend of Secretary Seward. I am acting as trustee of his mother, a lady between eighty and ninety years of age, and have known the Judge for the last 40 years.
It is due to him to say that I have ever found him a frank, manly, and generous fellow, and have learned from others that in past years, when the yellow fever has prevailed at New Orleans, he has devoted himself to many Northern men regardless of personal exposure, and evinced a self sacrificing spirit.
May I venture to ask you to review his case, to confront him with his accuser. I fear that he may suffer from the malignity of some secret foe, for I cannot reconcile the offence with which he is charged with his past life.
If his case cannot be reviewed, may I not ask for him some modification of the sentence. He has not been accustomed to labor, is of Northern constitution, and a Sentence for two years to Ship Island will, I fear, prove a sentence of death.
If he is to be punished, might not his sentence be commuted to imprisonment at New Orleans or Fort Warren? While making this request, you will understand me to have no sympathy with secession, and that with our community I heartily endorse your policy at New Orleans, but the past of Judge Andrews I feel warrants some revision of his case, or at least some mitigation of his sentence. I have the honor to be
Very respectfully Yours, E. H. Derby
New Orleans, July 2nd, 1862 To E. H. Derby, Esq., Boston
Dear Sir: Judge John W. Andrews requests me to write you these few lines. He is sentenced to two years' hard labor on Ship Island. The charge against him is that he exhibited in the Louisiana Club in this City a cross which came enclosed to him in a letter from Virginia, and which letter stated that the cross was made from ""a bone of a Yankee!""
I am myself a member of the Louisiana Club, and have made diligent enquiries whether any one had ever seen such a thing exhibited there, and there is not a single person connected with the Club, including the servants, who has ever seen or heard of this cross.
The Judge says he received the cross, and though the letter stated that the boys in Camp wished the writer to say that it was made of the bone of a Yankee, he considered it was made of Ivory, looked no different. The only way in which he might ever have shown it is, perhaps (according to his memory), that
some one might have been in his Company as he received the letter at the Post Office, or he might have shown the letter and the cross at his office when they were received, but never did he hawk the cross about the streets, least of all show it with any spirit of exultation. That he is incapable of such fiendish, inhuman joy, you know from his personal character.
The sentence is a very severe one. The Judge's health is quite feeble, and he is physically unable to endure such punishment. At the same time, his friends cannot prevail upon Genl. Butler to alter his sentence at this time. Perhaps, after a while, he will be better disposed to reconsider his case. There have been some aggravated cases of this kind before the General lately, he has dealt with them all alike.
If you could, prevail on the War Department or on Genl. Butler, if not to revoke the sentence at least moderate it in view of the Judge's health, as well as in view of his not being guilty in the light in which Genl. Butler received the accusation. He can certainly not live long on Ship Island; if nothing better can be done for him, he will be thankful to you if you will endeavor to have him transferred to Fort Warren.
The Judge would have written to you himself, but he is now a prisoner, & his communications have to pass through General Butler's Department.
Yours respectfully, H. Bonzano"

My Dear Sir: I have failed to get signature to the letter which I submitted to your inspection. All with whom I have conversed on the subject condemn the unfeeling and revolting remark of Mr. Andrews, but they are unwilling to admit, as that letter expressed, the necessity of punishment, because that remark, however offensive, was made some months before you came hither -- a fact of which I was myself ignorant when I wrote the letter, having supposed that it was of recent occurrence.
I must, therefore, leave Mr. Andrews to your clemency, and I hope, General, that the integrity of his character, the feebleness of his health, and the amiability of your own heart, which recognizes punishment only as a preventive of crime, and which has suggested this punishment of Mr. Andrews'
from the pure motive alone of keeping peace between the Inhabitants and your Soldiers, will procure for him a release, believing that what has already been done is enough to deter others from a paramount offence. I have the honor to remain

Sir: Upon being left in command at this place, I find in my custody thirteen male prisoners, all of them sentenced to hard labor, and there are orders that two of them shall not be allowed communication with any one upon the Island.
Regretting my inability to carry out these orders so strictly as I could wish, I have felt it my duty to inform you of the insecure position of the prisoners, and the difficulty, if not impossibility of having your instructions fully complied with.
The Fort, in its present state of incompleteness, has no accommodation for them whatever. They are at present confined, as I found them, all in one small wooden building, away from the main guard. I have been compelled to continue to keep them there, as I have no other more suitable quarters, no men to build them, and not men enough to guard them were they separated.
Of the two Companies left in my Command, only three Commis. Officers, three Sergeants, seven Corporals, & fifty-four privates are reported ""present for duty,"" so that, leaving no margin for increase of sickness, by putting one-half my available men on guard each day, which with their other duties makes as much fatigue and exposure as in this climate and season they can bear, I can have nine posts in all! but two for outpost duty, two for these prisoners, no Camp guard or guard at Head Quarters, and barely sufficient left to guard the stores about the wharf and buildings, and the female prisoners in their separate quarters.
I am aware, Sir, that I am violating the ""general rule"" in addressing this communication directly to yourself, but I trust that the greater distance of my immediate superior and the difficulty of communication may prove a sufficient excuse.

July 15, 1862
To Maj. Genl. Butler, Commanding U. S. Forces,
New Orleans, La.
General: I have received petitions from Officers of the 1st Regiment La. Partisan Rangers, touching the case of Henry Castle, a private of Co. H. of that regiment, and also an application respecting Thomas C. Pennington, a private of Capt. Wilson Tates Comp. of the same Regmt. and I deem it expedient to request your early consideration of the Subject.
It appears that Private Castle was captured by a detachment of Federal Troops in the vicinity of Baton Rouge, on or about the seventh of the present month, and Private Pennington on or about the 28th day of June, that they were taken to New Orleans, and are now held either there or at one of the Forts in the vicinity, in close confinement, with the threat that they are to be tried and executed as members of a military organization not sanctioned by the laws of civilized warfare. It is to be observed that the first great law of nature, the right of self-defense, is inherent in communities as well as individuals. No law condemns the individual who slays the robber or assassin, and no just law can condemn a community for using all its power to resist the Invader and drive him from their soil.
The exercise of this right, so universally recognized, becomes an imperative duty when the invader, as has been the case with the Federal Troops in this district, disregards those rules of warfare recognized and respected by all civilized nations, and adopts that code which has heretofore been confined to the rudest Savages.
The proof of this is unfortunately too abundant in the vicinity of Baton Rouge. It is attested by helpless women and children flying from their burning homes; by desolation of plantations; by the plunder of private property, and the wanton destruction of growing crops. Such acts are crimes against Humanity, and justify all men in taking up arms against their perpetrators.
The independence of nations has rarely been achieved by regular armies. Our own revolution; that revolution which successfully established the great principle for which the Confederate States are now contending ""that all Governments
derive their just powers from the consent of the governed,"" was mainly fought out by men who left the plow at the news of the Enemy's approach, and returned to it when he had been driven back. It may be conceded that in Europe, where the Governments mainly rely upon large standing Armies which are, as much as possible, disconnected with the people, and where the policy is to prevent the people from bearing arms under almost any circumstances, some very absurd refinements on this subject have been asserted, and to some extent tolerated. But such doctrines have never been recognized on this continent; the United States especially have repudiated them.
The various Revolutions which have agitated the Central and South American States have been conducted by the people frequently without organization, and without leaders other than those chosen upon the spur of the occasion to direct a single enterprise. And to recur to the Revolution of our Forefathers, the history of that immortal struggle abounds with instances where the hardy yeomen as at Lexington and Bunker Hill were like the clansmen of ""Roderick Dhu,"" called by a concerted signal to some ""Limerick Mead"" and there selected their officers from the very field of battle.
But whatever difference of opinion may exist on this point, it has never been claimed, even by the most stringent advocates of legitimacy, that one Belligerent has any right to complain of the name or form which the other may choose to give to its Military organization. The right to adapt these to the peculiar service required has been universally conceded. So far, indeed, has this practise been carried in naval warfare that privateersmen, ""The Militia of the Seas,"" with charters as broad as the ocean's bounds, are recognized as legitimate among Belligerents. And now, indeed, the extraordinary spectacle is presented to the contemplation of civilized man in this boasted nineteenth century of the Christian world, of a nation claiming to be civilized, in violation of its constitutional obligations, inaugurating deliberately servile war by stimulating the half-civilized African to raise his hand against his master and benefactor, and thus make war upon the Anglo-Saxon race -- war on human nature.
This with the Federal Government is legitimate warfare, but the defense of their firesides by Southern Citizens is treason and murder. In military organizations, the Polish Lancers, French Zouaves, and British Corps of Scouts and guides in
the late East Indian War, are cases in point. The Confederate States claim and have exercised this undoubted right. The formation of Companies, Battalions, and Regiments of Partisan Rangers, has been specially authorized by an act of Congress. The Officers of this Corps are commissioned, the men are regularly mustered into Service, receive pay, rations, and equipments from the Government, and are entitled to the same privileges and governed by the same regulations as all other troops in the Confederate Service. It is not perceived, therefore, what pretext can be offered by the Enemy for subjecting the members of this Corps to a different treatment from that extended to other prisoners of war. Certainly no such distinction can be recognized or tolerated by us. The Government having called these men into service, is bound by every obligation of good faith to protect them to the extent of its power; and if found necessary for their protection as well as for that of numerous unarmed citizens who have been subjected to outrages unparalleled in civilized warfare, will not hesitate. I feel constrained to declare, to resort to retaliation even to the extent sanctioned by the Jewish Law, ""An Eye for an Eye, a tooth for a tooth,"" and ""life for life."" I await an answer containing an explicit declaration of the intentions of the United States Government respecting these prisoners.

In reply to your request for information, I will state that Steal's Guerilla band consists of about 160 men, of two companies Commanded by Capt. McInnis and Capt. John Portervins. It has no more discipline than a mob, and is composed generally of very bad characters. The Officers have no control over the men, and no experience. The men are armed with double-barrelled guns, carrying buckshot and conical balls. The men ride and shoot well, and are accustomed to rough life. They say they were within 30 yds. of Lt. Dickenson's Pickets, and could have shot them; but preferred making a charge, thinking they would capture the boat. They are even said to have their camp at a place called the Center, 20 miles from Gainsville -- east, and are dispersed in small
parties recruiting their horses, which are very poor. They threaten to arrest all prisoners going to the Fort or New Orleans.
John Portervins (son of Wm. Portervins) has been sent to Johnstown to procure two pieces of cannon for Gainsville, and to induce Maj. Gen. Van Dorn, who has superseded Lovell, to send the 3rd Regt. here -- Capt. Wm. Portervins is the most violent and bitter man in his community; but for him and one or two more there would be no trouble here.
Brig. Gen. Ruggles (a Connecticut man) has been assigned to the command of all that part of La. east of the Miss, River, and of the three seaboard counties of this State, Head Quarters somewhere on the Railroad. It is whispered that they expect to try and surprise the Fort by a night expedition.
There is a report that Richmond has been taken. A man came from Mobile yesterday, who says he saw dispatches from Richmond that the U. S. forces were beaten. This man is an agent of the Telegraph Co. He came here to pay James O. Roah for taking up the Telegraph cable, and to remove the apparatus and batteries that belonged to Fort Pickens. It seems that ""O. Roah"" brought them here to the house his family occupies, and this man has been sent from Mobile for them, and they are to be set up by the Confederate authorities. Great value is attached to them. ""O. Roah"" must have communicated with the Telegraph agent at Mobile, through one of the steamers carrying flour, or by letter sent here and mailed by his son. I give this in strict confidence. If O. Roah is apprised of it, when he is discharged I shall lose my property by fire. If you intend to detain him, it is hoped he will be removed from the Fort. Many of us would like to go there also to trade with the city; but we are afraid of this man's tongue after he may be released.

General: Altho' you have been invested with high honors and power, it must not be supposed that you can act as the veriest despot without being judged by the tribunal of the
Civilized World. It is not the rowdy press of New York that will recognize your actions, neither can a suborned government, or a Congress impelled as it is by madness, who will assoilize you in what you have done at New Orleans. They are looking at it in Greece, in Turkey, in Austria, in France, in Germany, and in England. The Consuls whom you have treated with so much contumely have rights above those you describe, and their despatches and journals will henceforth be brought forward as witnesses against you; in fact, neutrals have arrived in Europe to prove to their respective Governments that you stole their money from Mr. Smith's Bank and other places, private property in every sense of their case.
Have foreign citizens no inalienable rights further than you choose to grant them? Europe must see to this. Your authority will be called in question seriously, and then will follow a system of reprisals, and I need not tell you that friends will be sure to point out your property in New England for adjudication. Take warning in time. Conciliation is your forte instead of the reverse. I have been put to confusion and shame on your account, and subscribe myself.

It would appear that the recent acts of the Federal military commandant at New Orleans have met with the very reverse of approbation from the Government at Washington; for it is understood that by this time the Federal General Butler has most probably arrived at New York, and that if he has not been ignominiously recalled, his removal can, at the most, be qualified by the ingenious term invented by continental journalists of a ""release"" from the functions he has so strangely, and, it would seem, so wantonly and brutally exercised. Moreover, according to our advices from the same quarter, the Cabinet of President Lincoln have despatched two well-accredited gentlemen to New Orleans to make sedulous inquiries into at least the entire civil administration, which has prevailed since the city was occupied by the Northern forces, if not into the remarkable military government of General
Butler. It is time. The rumours and reports of what has been going on in the Crescent City have done more harm and thrown more odium on the Federal cause in Europe than even the shameful stampede at Bull's Run, or the atrocious mission of the stone fleet to Charleston. Moreover, the misguided, ostrich-like policy of the Federal Government, in banishing honest and honourable European journalists from the headquarters of their army, has opened the door to the admission of malignant reports, while it has hindered the dissemination of authentic intelligence and impartial comments. Instead of being able to depend on the communications of gentlemen who have no interest save in speaking the truth, we are driven to the lucubrations of partisans, whose interest may lie in an exactly contrary direction, or to bald and meagre telegrams, on whose skeleton items of news all kinds of conjectures may be built. An intelligent and unbiased observer in New Orleans might have told us whether the attitude of its population could in any way justify General Butler issuing the atrocious proclamation which has aroused the indignation of politicians of every clsss in Europe -- whether his troops were really in danger of being insulted or annoyed by coarse . . . levelled against ladies who had been guilty of no more violent overt act than that of turning their heads away when their captors passed, of refusing to dance with them, or rising from their seats in church when the deadly foes of their husbands and brothers entered.
Then, again, there is the terrible story of the man Mumford, whose execution for the not very heinous sin of pulling down the United States flag from one of the public buildings, is given with characteristic minuteness, and a sensation gusto, in the Northern journals. An informant on the spot might have enlightened us as to whether the man was in arms against the Government, whether he was one of a band of conspirators whose object it was to overturn the Federal occupation, or whether he was suspected of incendiarism. If General Butler, acting according to the licence of the martial law he proclaimed, caused its extreme penalty to be inflicted on a prisoner taken in flagrant delict of rebellion to his authority, his conduct, although certainly harsh and perhaps cruel, is not entirely devoid of warranty. The unhappy Mumford only suffered the same doom which Napoleon inflicted on Palm the bookseller, and in the application of which, during the Irish Rebellion of '98, the English General Beresford
positively revelled. But if this unfortunate man was consigned to the gallows simply for a freak which might just as probably be committed by a drunken rowdy as by an inveterate rebel, the proceedings of Butler appear to us closely to resemble murder of the most brutal and deliberate character. It is almost, in fact, tantamount to a refusal of quarter to the opponents of the North, and can scarcely fail, we should imagine, to lead to the bloodiest reprisals. Unfortunately the deeds of violence and oppression ascribed to the ruthless military commandant whose supersession is by this time, we believe, an accomplished fact, have followed each other with such rapidity, and have shown such a characteristic originality of savagery, that we can scarcely believe them to have been invented or even exaggerated. We learn by the latest telegrams that an alderman of the City of New Orleans and the Chairman of the Ladies' Relief Committee have been condemned to hard labour, with a ball and chain affixed to their legs, in Fort Jackson. That a punishment reserved for felons of the worst description, and which modern humanity has removed from among the hardships undergone by convicts and galley-slaves, should be inflicted on American gentlemen by a fellow-countryman for no crime against the laws, but simply for political causes, seems well-nigh to surpass the bounds of possibility. In protesting against such infringements of the commonest dictates of humanity and courtesy, we may be twitted with the reminder of what we ourselves did during our civil wars; but we may proudly retort that, even two hundred years ago, when the world was far ruder and more barbarous than it now is, no instance is on record of a partisan of the Commonwealth being hanged for pulling down the King's arms, or of a Roundhead being sent to beat hemp in Bridewell for wounding the amour propre of the Cavaliers.
General Butler appears to have got on no better with the foreign residents in New Orleans than with those Southerners, who, notwithstanding their Confederate sympathies, we suppose, he will condescend to recognize as native-born Americans. He has been continually wrangling with the European representatives. The acting British consul, Mr. Coppell, having sought for information respecting the oaths to be exacted from foreigners sojourning in New Orleans, General Butler is stated to have replied that no answer could be given until Mr. Coppell's credentials and ""pretensions"" are recognized by the British Government and the Federal
executive, a decision which virtually leaves the British residents in New Orleans, for an indefinite period, without any protection whatever. The Washington Government will have reason, we should think to rue the day when the intemperate and seemingly half-crazy soldier, who has been carrying matters with such a high hand in New Orleans, was permitted to exercise unbridled authority in their name. What has he not done? He has converted smouldering discontent into frenzied hatred; he has widened the gulf between North and South. He has -- the insensate! -- made war against women; he has brought upon the enlightened and civilized United States of America the stigma of being ruled by a Junta of merciless tyrants, whose delight is in wanton and cruel bloodshed. He has forced the soldiers of a Christian nation to do the work of Pagan scalpers and tomahawkers; and it will be fortunate indeed if ere his recall he has not involved his employers in a fresh dispute with England, and set the initiative of a broil with France. For the military as well as the civil government of a city so peculiar as New Orleans, and possessing as it does so cosmopolitan a population, the services of a temperate, forbearing, humane, and eminently discreet officer were essential. As it is, the supreme power, with its frightful latitude for doing mischief, has been entrusted to a coarse and ruffianly desperado, who, to judge from his published proclamations, seems entirely destitute of the thoughts, the feelings, the language, and the manners, not only of a soldier, but of a gentleman."

Dear Sir: Permit me to represent that we are in great need of immediate protection from the invasion of lawless bands of men, who seize and carry off our Citizens under the Confederate conscription law, burn cotton, and take possession of the guns of the Citizens. Several persons have been captured as prisoners of State, and Mr. Doff Denst was killed in his own house after he had surrendered. Fifty men could afford us much assistance and prevent the further destruction of cotton and other property. The officers of the Parish are still acting under the authority of the Southern Confederacy. I think by the arrest of a few persons who act as leaders, and by requiring all other persons to give an allegiance, we will be able to feel secure in our persons and property.

My dear dear Wife: Why do you fret yourself and make yourself unhappy as you do in your last two letters? Pray, don't you think I will scold you, not at all, if you weep -- I will weep with you if I cannot dry your tears. And you let yourself be vexed with so many things that would not alarm you if you knew all. A vivid imagination, love, while it is your highest gift, is a very dangerous one to your peace. Let me brush away a dew-drop or two. The bells were shipped on board a transport for the government, by the government, and the government is to do just what it pleases with them. Snow has nothing to do with them, can show no order or authority whatever. Snow is the most infernal liar and rascal that lives. He has cheated everybody, lied to everybody, and if he ever comes out here will be sent to the Parish Prison for swindling. He is in no way, shape, or form interested with Andrew in any transaction or ever has been. He has no orders from him -- can show none.
As regards funds in the hands of Fay. Not a dollar can be drawn except by my order, even of that which belongs to Andrew. Every bill of lading has been endorsed to me for security. I am sorry that Fay did not choose to accept my draft at once. His letters to me say that he would have done so if he had been at home. I had no doubt that the matter would be all
right. What you say about his claim that my stock is pledged annoys me, for I assure you it is not but for six thousand dollars which I will have paid, and I have sent him ten thousand dollars in cash, and he has of my private funds some five thousand dollars. But be not troubled. Have not all affairs private as well as public gone well in fact?
My dear, dear, good wife, you ask me not to scold you. If you knew how my heart is full of kindness and love, yearning to see you, you would not write me so. Anybody else fill your place -- that is impossible, another may do everything but that. That will never be done. There is in my heart a sanctum sanctorum, a holy of holies, a niche for you alone, sacred to you, never to be intrenched on by the profane! Would you could fully believe so and never doubt more. That sometimes, in fullness of perfect possession, in the satiety of daily life, I am careless and impetuous in expression, does not show this to be different. You know and feel (acknowledge it, poor heart, and cheer up, be happy) that all is right. I am your baby, but may not the petulant child cry when an awry pin pricks him? ""Out of joint."" If you would write me it were so I would give my commission for it! Tell me at least that it is possible -- it may be so hereafter.
I will write Carney upon the matter of the consignment, and explain the matter to him.
Be not alarmed about my health. This city today is as healthy as any in the Union, -- 25 deaths only last week -- look to Boston and there are twice as many, 54 falling off in one week.
Caroline is with me as housekeeper, so you need feel no anxiety about her. My health is now precisely as it has been, if anything, rather better. The city is a little uneasy under the rumors of our defeat at Richmond, but I will take care of them.
You see that I have become suddenly famous, or rather, Lord Palmerston thinks infamous, by the No. 28. It is right, it was right. It will be right, and be the most popular act of my life. You said it was right at the time, and therefore I knew it was right. It was done for no hope of popularity, but because it was right, and it is well. I am not sure your idea of ""circumspection"" in what one does comes to much. Do what is right by ""instinct"" -- that is best. All my well considered acts pretty much have been failures. My instinct is better than my reason.
This leads me to say that there is not one wrong thing about those shipments, not one that cannot be shown to be correct. Best for the Government, best for the shipper, and good for everybody, even the Abolitionists, because it gives them something to growl over. I will take care of you, myself, the children, -- all. Fear not, love, but be happy. I will scold if I hear of your dropping a tear till I return. Be gay yourself -- four days in the house, shame, shame, go out, go out. Breathe the fresh air. Have picnics, rides, frolics -- get fat -- kiss me when you can get me, or at least get ready to do so. There, I have spent all the morning gossipping with you -- that was always the way. I thought my business would not be interrupted when you went home, but see, I have spent all the morning with you -- and I can run riot in the gossip too. You don't shake your head at all. Goodbye, dearest, back to dinner!

New Orleans
General: Several years ago, a friend of mine planted a mission, organized a parish, and built an Episcopal Church at Natchitoches, Louisiana. His name was Thomas Scott Bacon, I assisted him to build the edifice and presented him with a bell. The bell bore an inscription of which I had a copy, but is mislaid, and a verse from the Gospel. The matter was attended to, and bill paid by an agent, and therefore I cannot give particulars, but I think the bell was cast by Meneely and Son, of Troy.
Another friend of mine saw by the papers and informed me that you had seized 800 bells at New Orleans, collected in Louisiana and adjacent districts, pursuant to a call of Jefferson Davis to be cast into cannon.
As the people of Louisiana do not appear to have sense enough to set a value upon such sacred things, and as I did not intend my money invested in a bell to go towards founding cannon to be used in shooting down honest and loyal men, I would like to reclaim the bell for our own church at home, which needs one.
As I suppose that the proceeds of the sales of the bells will be regarded as prize money, I would like to redeem the bell if possible at the same rate the others sell or have been sold for.
Any information you will permit one of your clerks to afford me on this subject will be thankfully received. Please direct your clerk to address a reply to

Brig. Gen. Phelps knows me well, and that I am a party worthy this attention. I am the more interested in this matter as a portion of the gifts to the church to which I sent the bell (the Communion Service silver I know) were memorials of a dear little daughter, deceased, for whose sake I contributed that her name might live in connection with the church, little dreaming that its founder, Rev. Mr. Bacon, would be driven forth, partially if not wholly ruined, on account of his loyalty; that its consecrator, Leonidas Polk, would turn his crosier into a sword, and become a leader of rebels; and Louisiana, the property of the nation, a nest of traitors which you are so valiantly and thoroughly endeavoring to purify.

Sir: In connection with the silver coin taken from the shop of the Consul of Belgium, I deem it my duty to submit for your investigation the fact of the deposit in the hands of the Consul of France, of about seven hundred and fifty thousand dollars in silver coin, about the same time, under the following described state of facts:
At daybreak on Sunday, April 21st, or near that time, this large bulk of coin was transferred from the Citizens' Bank to the vaults of the French Consul. This, together with that sent into the Belgian Consul's Shop, was the entire silver coin of the Bank, so bulky that it could not be easily otherwise secreted.
Upon investigation, it appeared that the commercial house of Dupasseur & Co. of this City, claimed this specie as having purchased it by bills, valued on Paris at five francs the dollar for that amount of about that date, drawn in favor of the Citizen's Bank. The senior member of the firm stated to me that he bought this silver for speculation, that he expected to make Thirty thousand dollars by exporting it to Paris after the blockade was raised. That he did not take it to his own house, and did remove it to the French Consul's at this unusual time of a Sabbath morning, from fear of the mob if he moved it in business hours, and that he desired to place it under the French Flag for protection, because of the excited state of the City.
I need not remind you, so well-trained in judicial investigation, of the improbability of such a transaction, involving three quarters of a million, in such dangerous times, with such hope of profit and the entire uncertainty of ever being
able to ship the specie to meet the bills, with our cannon at that moment thundering at the Forts, and the City in fear daily of a bombardment.
It will be useful to compare dates of both these transactions, because if the object of the Citizen's Bank was to really pay Hope & Co. their interest, why not have sent forward these bills of Durprasseur, instead of transporting the silver at par in Mexican Dollars, which command a premium, to the Belgian Consul? The amounts are nearly equal, but by the two transactions the Bank got away every dollar of its silver. I should be glad to be present at the investigation of this case if public duties will permit.

We have now waited so long for our pay that the loss of interest to us is more than $6,000, -- which is of itself a hardship, but I have been here five weeks a daily attendant upon the Quarter Master General's Department to get my pay, or learn the reasons why I could not, and am informed that you purchased too nice goods, and that I must look to you for my pay. ""Sue General Butler and his Quarter Master, we will not pay your bills until you discount about $25,000.""
I have explained away most of their objections to the payment of said vouchers, and, having done all I can, I returned home to Boston disheartened, and make this appeal to you, asking your influence (if you think proper to give it) with the President in my behalf. I do this the more confidently because your authority was brought in question by the Quarter Master General, and also because you know whether or not I served the Government faithfully and honestly in delivering to your Department the best quality of goods, and you also remember the assurances I received of payment of my account. The only remaining objections I received of my account are that you ordered from us the same shirts and drawers and blouses that the States of New York, Mass., and Maine, and Col. Crossman, U. S. Qr. Master at Philadelphia, had been having of us, and in ten times greater quantities, yet we gave them to you at the same prices, they have all paid us, and Government has reimbursed them, therefore it would seem my misfortune that I am a citizen creditor of the Government instead of a State or Quarter Master. Why it is, with such facts before them and precedents, they should deny your contracts for same articles and prices, is what I want you to help me ascertain, and also why some of your Quarter Master's Vouchers should be paid by his successor, Capt. McKim, to favorites
without apparent objection, while he refuses others, and says unqualifiedly that he has paid none. Your soldiers have had our garments now more than six months, certainly long enough to test their quality, we faithfully fulfilled our contracts, and ask your assistance in our behalf that the Government may fulfill theirs, that we may not much longer suffer.
What General Meigs asks is that the all-wool indigo blue mixed shirts and drawers should be discounted in price equal to Government goods of all cotton fabric, and that the cloth coats should be reduced in price to that of their flannel blouses. Any business man can see the absurdity and the injustice of such treatment. I have the honor to be,

My dear General: I have just returned from New York, where my errand was to inquire about the freights paid vessels bringing mdse. from New Orleans. I found there had been
but one vessel discharged there, under precisely the same circumstances as those whose cargoes are consigned to me. In that case, however, Capt. Stinson, Act. Q. M., delivered the cargo at the rate specified upon the Bills of Lading. I have made the strongest appeal to Genl. Meigs from McKim's decision to claim market rates of freight, regardless of B. of L., and if unsuccessful shall carry it up to the Sec'y. of War, and if necessary to the President.
I am very sorry that you will not have the profit upon the merchandise shipped before the first of June, as it has paid best of all. Your instructions to offer the business to the Govt. were, however, explicit, and had the War Dept. not taken it, Fox would have taken the merchandise, under your letter to him. Everything shipped since the opening of the port I have carried to your account or your brother's (and the profit will be very satisfactory).
I called at your house on Monday, the 14th, and saw Mrs. Butler, apparently very well. She knew nothing of the map you wrote me about, nor have I heard of it anywhere else.
I am shipping some hay and flour to Mr. A. Montgomery by the brig ""Hannah Thornton,"" which sails from New York today. She is chiefly laden with Govt. stores, and I hope will receive every proper facility in the way of tonnage, etc.
I have been so pressed by the large amount of this business that I have not yet been able to write you so fully as I wish to do. My first thought and effort has been to guard your personal reputation in official transactions intact and unspotted. In this I believe I have been entirely successful, and if in my care in this regard I have not made all the money for you I could have done, you will not think me the less, but more,

My dear Sir: I have to thank you for your favor of the 2nd instant, which came duly to hand. The drafts have all been provided for. The government, I understand through Mr. Fay, paying me $60,600 for drafts and commissions. I cashed the drafts so as to pay off Messrs.

It came at a fortunate time for making the negotiations; and so all trouble, after the first ""hitch,"" was escaped.

My dear General: I wrote you June 14th owning receipt of yours and Col. Butler's favors of 1st inst., covering sundry drafts and invoices of shipments to me. I went immediately to Washington, where the transaction made a great deal of discussion, the essential difficulty being with the shipments made before the opening of the Port, June 1st, in view of the jealousy with which the blockade is regarded by foreign powers. The result, however, was that the Govt. assumed the transaction, making me its agent to sell the merchandise, pay the drafts, and hand them the profits. I enclose a copy of the letter of the Secretary of War containing Gen. Meigs' report upon the case. Considering the beautiful opportunities afforded for making difficulty, I think this a very satisfactory settlement, and very complimentary to your judgment. Secretary Stanton spoke in the warmest terms of your administration. Indeed he could hardly have said more in your praise. Although I am very sorry the profit on these operations does not accrue to you, I think Gen. Meigs' view a just one, and it will be far better to be able to silence the many remarks current here about the business from which your reputation would have suffered if uncontradicted. Returning from Washington only this morning, I find your favors of 10th and 11th. I will attend to your wishes about the map. The cheque for $10,000 will be placed to your credit when paid. You will observe that no bond or accountability is required of me by Govt., a handsome compliment, and a hint that they do not want to make too large a record of the business as a precedent.
Genl. McClellan has been largely reinforced. He was not defeated at Fair Oaks, but drove back a sortie in great force, losing 8 guns and 10,000 men in doing it. I came from Norfolk to Washington with a Norfolk lady. She told me that the capture of New Orleans was the only event of the war
which had disturbed the smooth current of the Secession confidence. It was a terrible blow to them. Fremont was virtually beaten at Woodstock, and Shields at Port Republic, and nothing but the invincible steadiness of my ""Beacon St. dandy friends"" of the 2nd Mass. saved Banks the loss of every man and wagon of his command at Winchester. I trust it is not wrong to say that I think Jackson the most brilliant officer the war has produced. Stern impartiality compels me to do it. He now has Siegel against him, and I rather think a genius better adapted to cope with him, with equal numbers, than any officer we have.
During my absence, several of Col. Butler's drafts on me, and some of yours on Carney, were noted for non acceptance. I have accepted them all to-day. I understand Mr. Carney has put Mr. Hildreth to some trouble to secure him. It was unnecessary, as I would have paid his draft ""for your honor"" (honor commercial). I shall go to see Mrs. Butler as soon as I can leave Boston. I suppose she has the map, as I have not seen it. I am heartily glad she is at home again. I write to Col. Butler with figures, etc.

My dear General: I needed not your note of this morning to satisfy me on the subject to which it relates. The public mind should have been put right upon it by your proclamation of the 7th of May. In these times, however, opinion is so sensitive, and misrepresentations so frequent, on all matters touching the unfortunate condition of the country, that I am glad to have your note with the privilege to make it public.
The restoration of commerce in and from this port is a result so important to the interest of this State, the United States, and the Governments of Europe, that it seems strange that an intelligent man should have doubted your wish as the representative of our Government, to do all that you could do to bring it about.
If there be any really existing fear upon the point, your
note (for which I thank you) cannot fail to remove it. The Confederate Government, as it calls itself, may burn and destroy the Cotton and Sugar of the people whom they claim to represent, and whose right they pretend to be anxious to protect. They may, too, for a time succeed in keeping alive the delusion of their followers, but an intelligent Southern public, and an intelligent European opinion, will soon, if it has not already, discover the shallowness of the pretense, and see, unless soon arrested by the fostering power of the Government, the certain ruin to which it must lead.

Maj. Genl. Butler
Sir: The question of the propriety of the payment made to you under protest, on the 5th of June last, of $8948.50, Eight thousand Nine hundred and forty-eight 50/100 Dollars, by Messrs. S. H. Kennedy & Co. of this City, the estimated value of a third of Exchange at sixty days after sight, dated Havana, the 30th of the previous April, for $1789.14, One thousand Seven hundred and eighty-nine pounds and fourteen shillings, which you have submitted to this Commission, I have carefully considered. The facts attending the shipment of the cotton to Havana by Messrs. Kennedy & Co., on the proceeds of which the bill was drawn, as well as all the other facts connected with the transaction, are clear. The shipment was in violation of the blockade, and if seized in delicto would have been liable to forfeiture. The proceeds also, if received here on the return voyage, would have been equally liable
to forfeiture. The vessel would also either on the outer or return voyage have been in like manner liable. But the blockade having been successfully run, and the cotton sold in Havana, and the first and second of Exchange drawn by the shippers' consignees in Havana, and sent to London by shippers' orders to be passed to their credit in London, the first question is, whether the third of Exchange is to be esteemed the proceeds of the shipment and liable to seizure? I am of the opinion it cannot. The first and second of Exchange having been paid by the drawers in London, and the proceeds passed to the credit of the shippers, the third is a mere nullity, valueless in the hands of the shippers. It was not then the representatives of the cotton or its proceeds. The first was the property of the buyers in Havana, the second the property of the shippers, because of the payment of the first or second, and the passing of its proceeds to their credit with their London Bankers.
The offense of running the Blockade is not, under the modern law of nations, a personal offense. It affects only the ship and the cargo. If these are not [retained] physically, or their proceeds on a return voyage, the offense escapes punishment. It never attends the vessel or the cargo further than to the termination of the [return?] voyage, with the exception of the immediate return voyage. The rule is well settled by modern authority, English, Continental, and American, that the offense is purged unless the vessel or cargo is captured in dilecto. The harshness of the ancient doctrine as to breaches of blockade, or of contraband of War, has long since been ameliorated. This has been affected by the silent but sure and effective influence of a more enlightened civilization, and a better sense of the importance to the interest of the nations of the world of an unrestricted Commerce. The rights of war as originally understood have been made to yield to a conviction of the greater value of this interest, War -- fortunately for the welfare of man -- is coming to be more and more occasional and temporary. Peace is the condition on which his happiness most depends. And all the ancient rules, applicable to a state of war, for a long period barbarous and pregnant with evil, have been for years so modified as to take from war many of its former terrible consequences.
Second. But there is another fatal objection to the payment exacted of Messrs. Kennedy & Co. When the third of Exchange was returned here, the blockade no longer existed. It
had been removed by Order of the President; and the Port declared to be open. Nothing is better settled than that the raising of a blockade, in the interval between the sailing in violation of it, and the capture of the offending Vessel and Cargo, exempts both from penalty. The object of enforcing the penalty is to guard against future violations of the Blockade, not of any that may thereafter be declared. The whole purpose is to secure the particular blockade against violation, and no other. When, therefore, that blockade is raised, the reason for forfeiture ceases. In the language of Wheaton, ""When the blockade is raised, a veil is thrown over everything that is done, and the vessel is no longer in delicto. The deliction may be completed at one period, but it is by subsequent events done away"" (Wheaton's Law of Nations 3rd edt. page 50). The same rule as well as the others I have stated will be found to be well-established by, amongst other authorities, the case of the ""Sanders,"" 2nd Gallican, pg. 210, 1st Rents Commentaries (6th edition pg. 151), and Carrington and al. versus the Merchants Insurance Comp. 8th Peters Reports, pp. 495-519.
My opinion is, therefore, that the sum received from Messrs. Kennedy & Co. should be returned to them. I have the honor to be, With high regard
Your Obdt. Servt.,
Reverdy Johnson, Commis."
"July 22, 1862","Head Qts. Dept. of the Gulf, New Orleans, July 22nd, 1862
Hon. Reverdy Johnson
Sir: I have your decision in the matter of the money paid by J. H. Kennedy & Co., and while I shall pay back the money in obedience to it, if the partners of the House take the Oath of Allegiance, I must dissent from the conclusions to which you have come toto animo.
The facts are briefly these. Kennedy & Corvere, merchants doing business in New Orleans, the members of which were citizens of the United States. They shipped Cotton bought at Vicksburg and brought it to New Orleans from a Bayou on the Coast, where Steamers were accustomed to run the Blockade to Havana, on board Steamships that were engaged in carrying goods from the neighborhood of New Orleans to Havana in defiance of the laws and the President's Proclamation, and under the further agreement with the Confederate authority here that a given per cent of the value
of their Cargoes should be returned in arms and Munitions of War for the use of the rebels here.
Without such an agreement, no Cotton could be shipped from New Orleans, and this publicly known, and the fact of Knowledge, that a permit for the vessel to ship cotton could only be got on such terms, was not denied at the hearing.
The Cotton was sold in Havana, and the net proceeds were invested in a draft (first, second, and third of exchange) dated April 30, 1862, payable to the London Agent of the House of Kennedy & Co., and the first and second sent forward to London, and the third, with account sales and vouchers, forwarded to the firm here through an illicit mail on board the Steamer ""Fox,"" likewise engaged in carrying unlawful merchandise and an illicit mail between Havana and the Rebel States.
The third of Exchange and papers are captured by the Army of the United States on tenth day of May on board the ""Fox"" -- flagrante delicto, surrounded by the Rebel Arms and Munitions, concealed in a Bayou leading out of Baratana Bay, attempting to land her contraband mails and scarcely less destructive arms and munitions to be sent through the by ways and swamps to the Enemy.
During all this time, J. H. Kennedy & Co. have not accepted the amnesty proffered by the proclamation of the Commanding Genl. but preferred to remain within its terms Rebels and Enemies.
Upon this state of facts, the Commanding General called upon Kennedy & Co. to pay the amount of net proceeds of the Cotton (the third of Exchange of the draft) which, with the documents relating to this unlawful transaction, he has captured as a proper forfeiture of the Government under the facts above stated, which was done upon the submission to you, whether the forfeiture was a proper one. You have decided that the money should be repaid, because the forfeiture was not proper.
Pardon me if I respectfully examine the grounds of that decision. They are: 1st. That there was no capture of the property or its representative actually running the blockade. 2nd. That there is no personal detection in Kennedy & Co. in the acts done by them, which can render them subject to forfeiture, and 3rd, that the blockade being raised by the proclamation of the President before the Capture of the draft and paper, all delection on account of the transaction is purged.
Was not this third of Exchange the very representative of the transaction in connection with the Account Sales? If the first or second has been paid, then of course it becomes valueless, but there was no evidence that either the first or second had been paid, nor could that have been done in 10 days from Havana to London, in which case the third is the sole ""proceeds"" of the illegal transaction. Is not the third of exchange usually sent by consignee to the principal, where the order is to transfer the fund to a distant House precisely for the purpose of representing the transaction? In the hands of the owners, S. H. Kennedy & Co., were not these several of exchange equal in value? If one holds the 1st & 2nd and third of Exchange, can it be said that one is more valuable than the other to the holder? Kennedy & Co. did hold all these by themselves or their Agents. All of equal value up to the capture.
The hazards of the return voyage was guarded against by a shipment to England of one of the representatives of the Cotton, but the commercial transaction was still in fieri in the transmission of its account sales and vouchers, and representative of value to the company here.
Even if I am right, however, it is unnecessary to elaborate the point further, because it seems to me that the decision turns upon a non-appreciation of the Law, what is the effect of the Blockade? As applied to this transaction, the citations and arguments, derived from elementary writers upon the law of Nations are of no value. This is not the case of a resident subject of a foreign State attempting to elude the vigilance of a blockade by a foreign power of a port of a third nation. The rule that a successful running of the Blockade, or a subsequent raising of the blockade, purges the transaction so far as punishment for personal deliction is concerned, is too familiar to need citation, at least by a lawyer to a lawyer. It would be desirable to see some citations to show there was no personal deliction in the transaction under consideration.
A traitorous commercial house, directly engaged in the treasonable work of aiding a Rebellion against the Government by entering into a trade, the direct effect of which is to furnish the rebels with arms and amunitions. To do this, they intentionally violate the Revenue laws, postal laws, of their Country, as well as the laws prohibiting trade with foreign countries from this port, and are caught in the act and fined only the Amount of the proceeds of their illegal treasonable transaction.
Their lives by every law were forfeit to the Country of their allegiance. The representative of that Country takes a comparatively small fine from them, and a Commission of that same Country refunds it, because of its impropriety.
Grotius, Puffendorf, Vatel, and Wheaton will be searched, it is believed in vain, for precedent for such action. Why cite international law to govern a transaction between the rebellious traitor and his own Government? Around the State of Louisiana the Government had placed the impassable barrier of law covering each and every subject, saying to him, from that State no Cotton should be shipped, and no Arms imported, and there no mails or letters should be delivered. To warn off foreigners, to prevent bad men of our own Citizens violating that law, the Governments had placed ships. Now, whatever may be the law relating to the intruding foreigner, can it be said for a moment that the fact that a traitor has successfully eluded the vigilance of the Government, that very success purges the crime which might never have been criminal but for this success? stare decisis.
The fine will be restored, but the Guilty Party ought to be and will be punished.
A course of treatment of rebels and traitors which should have such results [would be] not only ""rose water"" but diluted ""rose water."" The other reason given for the decision, that the Blockade had been raised, is a mistake in point of fact, both in the date and the place of capture. The capture was not made of a vessel running into the port of New Orleans, nor was the shipment made from the port of New Orleans, when the blockade was raised, but from one of those Lagoons where in former times [Lafitte] the pirate carried on a hardly more atrocious business.
Something was said at the hearing that this money was intended by Kennedy & Co. for northern creditors. Sending it to England does not seem to be the best evidence of that intention.
But, of course, no such consideration could enter into the decision. I have reviewed this decision at some length because it seems to me that it offers a premium for treasonable acts to traitors in the Confederate States. It says in substance, violate the laws of the United States as well as you can, send abroad all the produce of the Confederate States you can, to be converted into arms for the rebellion, you only take the risk of losing in transitu, and as the profits are four-fold, you
can afford so to do, but it is solemnly decided that in all this there is no personal deliction for which you can or ought to be punished even by a fine, and if you are, the fine shall be returned. I have the honor to be

Dear General: Yours by the hands of Mr. Bates has been received and attentively read. I will most cheerfully do all in my power to gain the end you desire. I have only attempted one Cotton speculation (at Red River), and that failed, being entirely surrounded by water. Since then I have had no share, lot, nor part in any Cotton transaction. I have not been able to do duty since I saw you, and I truly regret that such representations should be made to you by any one as to furnish you satisfactory grounds for threatening me. If any person save Moses Bates or a Jew has complained, I am not aware of it, and I most humbly beseech you not to hold me responsible for any charge based on their statements. If the charge comes from any other Quarter, I hope you will thoroughly investigate it, as I certainly desire at least as greatly to appear a gentleman as a soldier in your estimation. If I had a Boat at my command I could do much more in getting Cotton into market. There are a few points along the River, where the people have too much sense to destroy their Cotton, and would be glad to ship it off to market.
The prospect is getting better here, too, as many of the Citizens have sold for money instead of Confederate Bonds or Certificates. As soon as I can drive all the Rebel Bands of Guerillas beyond reach of the people, they will sell their Cotton. Many are now very desirous of being ""forced"" to sell, as they get better prices than ever before. If it was possible to get one or two more Companies of Cavalry here it would be of incalculable service. I could then follow the Guerilla Bands and break them up entirely. If I can only get hold of a few of the prominent ones it will die of itself and the hatred of the people.

The bearer of this is my husband, who is in great need of employment. We have seen better days. A few years ago my husband was proprietor of a paper in the State of N. Y. Now he is in the City of New Orleans without a ""TICKET"" in his pocket, and out of employment, while the ""Rebels"" here are given good ""fat"" situations. I am hungry, but too proud to let it be known. We went to bed without supper, and my dear husband is before you without breakfast. Dear General, I wish a favor at your hands. Do not refuse me, I am proud and a refusal will crush me. I have some furniture, and I am willing to give you a mortgage on it if you will be kind enough to let me have twenty-five or thirty Dollars' worth of rations from the Commissaries stores. Mr. Shipper will pay promptly as soon as he gets employment.

To Maj. Genl. Butler
Sir: In the case of the seizure of the goods in the store of Maull and Hancock in this City, which you have referred to this Commission, I am of the opinion that they should be restored.
Neither of the grounds, though at first view plausible, can be maintained. 1st. The fact that the parties, one or both, had been engaged in running the blockade, constitutes no
personal legal offense. The penalty for such conduct is but the forfeiture of the vessel and cargo. But this can only be enforced when the property is caught in deliclo, and that can only happen on the outward or immediate return voyage, and when at the time of seizure the blockade is in force. Neither of these facts existed in this instance, and, besides that, the goods seized are not the returns of any outward shipment. For authorities on this point, I refer you to those cited in the opinion I had the honor to give you yesterday in the case of Messrs. Kennedy and Co. 2nd. The fact, if true, that Hancock, one of the owners, was engaged in the rebellion or sympathized in it, is no cause of forfeiture of his property by military authority. But the fact is denied, and the truth of the denial is established to my satisfaction. 3rd. But if both the preceding views were erroneous, the goods should be returned. It appears that the House of Thaddeus Norris & Co. of Philadelphia, who never violated the Blockade or were privy to its violation by Maull and Hancock, and who are loyal citizens, are largely interested in the goods. This appears by an affidavit of Thaddens Norris, the head of the House, made in Philadelphia on the 27th ultimo, and by an account annexed to the same now before me. By these it appears that while Hancock is a creditor for $1722.20 Seventeen hundred and twenty-two 20/100 Dollars, and Maull for $5028.24 Five thousand twenty-eight 24/100 Dollars. Norris is one for $17,116.78 Seventeen thousand one hundred and sixteen 73/100 Dollars. To condemn the stock as the property of the two former would be to inflict upon Norris a total loss of his interest in the concern, a result evidently unjust. I have the honor to be with high regards

Gen. Williams was sent up at a time when we should have had only local troops to meet at Vicksburg. It was not properly within my Dept., but the exigencies of the public service, as it seemed to me, justified the movement.

I have, therefore, ordered his recall, as his force, since the reinforcement by Van Dorn and Breckinridge of the Enemy, is too small for operations alone, and a junction of Genls. Grant & Curtis must give ample force for the reduction of the place.

I suppose, again, of that kind. I note your query as to whether Palmerston would blow you from the muzzle of a gun; and it reminds me of an extract taken from the London Metropolitan Police Act, and I must say that one would quite readily believe that, if you had seen that Act, and ever copied from anybody, you had copied your ""Woman Order"" almost verbatim from it. The resemblance, if you never saw it, is absolutely wonderful. I hope you will be allowed to carry out your plans fully, cautiously, perseveringly, and thoroughly. So far, as a whole, I think the whole North is disposed to side with you to a greater extent than it has or does with any
General so long in the field. And I trust that if the Politicians, (for whom you know my ancient regard and respect) have succeeded in sending out one of ""their own"" as adviser with you, that he will turn out to be man enough to apprehend and comprehend the position, and be an aid instead of a clog and a hindrance in holding it man-fashion. If not, I can but hope that his Commission does not make him your Military Superior.
We are spunky and hopeful yet, here at the North. Have not quite done our paying though, intend to finish up that, and other odds and ends, and see what the ""muss"" is, and take hold and settle that. Your doctrine of going to war to hurt somebody is getting to be the prevailing creed, and by the 1st September will count the largest denomination. Knowing that you will be among the ""most zealous,"" and wishing you abundant success. I am as ever

My dear Sir: I spoke to you Saturday of a proposition made to me by an English Gentleman engaged in the cotton trade in Mobile.
His proposition is that the Rebels will permit cotton to come out of Mobile in exchange for salt and such merchandise as they need there, not contraband of war, provided the pledge shall be given that the cotton shall be shipped to England. Of course we do not care where the cotton goes, even if it goes to that portion of the world known as Great Britain where they inhumanly blow Rebels from guns, and such cities that are so unfortunate as to fall into their hands, as witness Pekin and Delhi.
Please give me your opinion, as this is rather a civil than military question. I have the honor to be,

My dear General: I have yours of yesterday. The proposal of the English gentleman, I think you should not hesitate to accept. The shipment of Cotton, whether to Europe or to the loyal States, from the rebellious States, from such of their ports as are in the possession of our forces, is, I know, much desired by our Government. It was one of the principal advantages they expected to be the immediate result of the capture of this City. So anxious are they to attain the object that I am satisfied they would readily sanction such an arrangement as your note mentions.
The question is as you state ""rather a civil than a military one,"" but in either case my opinion is that you answer it affirmatively. With great regard,

General: I have been informed by Mr. I. Maury, a British subject, that he has cotton within your lines which he is desirous of getting out and bringing here, if the same can be done. That you are willing it should come as the property of a neutral, if the cotton will not be seized by the United States forces and it can be sent to England.
For this purpose he is desirous of shipping to your port salt as an equivalent for the shipment of Cotton. I have pledged, therefore, to him that I will permit to be returned to Mobile a sack of salt for every bale of Cotton that he shall bring here. The Commercial values of the two articles to be regulated by the parties owning them -- that the Cotton may be shipped from this point to England, and that no seizure or Confiscation shall be made of the Cotton or salt or any part thereof, and the vessel containing the same shall have safe

I am shipping a few articles of provisions, but sparingly, as I am discouraged by the rush of speculators, and by the exorbitant freights. Recruiting goes on slowly, and we require a draft at once. General Halleck is established at Washington, and the newspapers are blowing his trumpet, while, even in Boston, General McClellan has scarcely a friend.

Dear Sir: This will be handed you by Mr. Roselius, of New Orleans. I need not say to you, who so well remember the events that inaugurated this rebellion, that Mr. Roselius was a member of the Louisiana convention that passed the Secession Ordinance, and one of the five that voted against it. True to the last, he has remained a firm friend to the Union, even to this day.
Representing a large class of opinion here, better acquainted than any other man with the feelings, intentions, and wishes of the people of this State, by his unblemished private life and high professional talent and acquirements, holding the respect of those whose violence would have otherwise rendered his life unsafe because of his steady adherence to the Union, it has seemed to me best that he should be in Washington to represent the true state of the negro question here. I have, therefore, ventured to send him at the expense of the United States, he giving his own time, that his knowledge of the state of things might be before the government. Please render him all the assistance you may be able, to enable him to give his views to the President.
I am convinced that in no other way could I do so much good to the country as introducing Mr. Roselius to your confidence. Believe me,

Sir: I take leave to present you Mr. Roselius, a gentleman of the Bar, late Attorney General of the State of Louisiana, a member of the Convention who did not vote for the Secession Ordinance. With some others only he was found faithful when all were faithless. Among the earliest to welcome the Union Army to New Orleans, he has assisted me with his advice and counsel. Of the one subject which is to be dealt with here & now he is better informed than any man in the State.
The questions involved as set forth in my correspondence upon the action of Gen. Phelps are of the most vital and critical
importance. The determination of them cannot be delayed, and it seemed to me of sufficient importance that the President should have the benefit of the experience of one who has a most intimate knowledge of the wishes, opinions, feelings, and thoughts of the people of the State of Louisiana, upon the Question of Slavery as interwoven with the integrity of the Union.

The Fleet have made a failure of it at Vicksburg, and have come down the river, and are going to Pensacola to recruit and repair. Gen.

Sir: I enclose herewith requisitions for arms, accoutrements, clothing, camp and garrison equipage, etc., for three Regiments of Africans which I propose to raise for the defence of this point.
The location is swampy and unhealthy, and our men are dying at the rate of two or three a day. The Southern loyalists are willing, as I understand, to furnish their share of the tax for the support of the war, but they should also furnish their quota of men, which they have not thus far done. An opportunity now offers of supplying the deficiency, and it is not safe to neglect opportunities in war. I think that with the proper facilities I could raise the three Regiments proposed in a short time. Without holding out any inducements, or offering any reward, I have now upward of three hundred Africans organized into five Companies, who are all willing and ready to be put to the test. They are willing to submit to anything rather than slavery.
Society in the South seems to be on the point of dissolution, and the best way of preventing the African from becoming instruments in a general state of anarehy is to enlist him in the cause of the Republic.
If we reject his services, any petty military Chieftan, by offering him freedom can have them for the purpose of robbery and plunder. It is for the interest of the South as well as for the North that the African should be permitted to offer
his block for the Temple of Freedom. Sentiments unworthy of the man who acts on the present day, worthy only of another Cain, would prevent such an offer from being accepted.
I would recommend that the Cadets, graduates of the present year, should be sent to South Carolina, and this point kept to organize and discipline our African levies, and that the more promising non-commissioned Officers and privates of the Army be appointed as Company Officers to command them. Prompt and energetic efforts in this direction would probably accomplish more toward a speedy termination of the War, and an early restoration of peace and amity, than any other course which could be adopted.

"July 31, 1862","Washington, July 31, 1862
My dear General: I have the pleasure of thanking you for your very friendly letter, and of acknowledging your note requesting the appointment of young Mr. Nelson in the revenue cutter service.
It would have given me pleasure to designate Mr. Nelson for examination, but he did not appear to be prepared for it without some further study. I contented myself, therefore, with expressions of good will, reserving the decision as to designation to a future time when he may again present himself. Meanwhile I doubt not he will be very useful to you. I have not seen Col. Shepley since he has been in Washington, which I regret, for I should have been very glad to confer with him fully as to matters in New Orleans. It is too late to seek him now, even if propriety did not require that he should first call on me. I say too late, because it is only within five minutes that I have learned that if I would get this letter to New York in time for the steamer it must be written forthwith. Hence this long sheet and hurried writing.
Nor have I seen the instructions, if any have been prepared, which Gen. Shepley is to take back with him to New Orleans; nor has it so happened that I have talked with either the President or Mr. Stanton on the subject of their instruction. All I know of the President's views is contained in the two letters enclosed herewith, -- one for Mr Bullett and the other for Mr. Johnson, which I have heard read, and which the President left with me today to be sent to those gentlemen. All I know positively, I mean; for I have heard intimations
from the President that it may possibly become necessary, in order to keep the river open below Memphis, to convert the heavy black population of its banks into defenders.
You will see from what I have written that in what I have to say on the important topic, touched in your letter by way of reply to mine I shall express only my own opinions, -- opinions, however, to which I am just as sure that the masses will and politicians must come, as I am sure that both politicians and masses have come to opinions expressed by me when they found few concurrents.
I begin with the proposition that we must either abandon the attempt to retain the Gulf States in the Union or we must give freedom to every slave within their limits. We cannot maintain the contest with the disadvantages of unacclimated troops and distant supplies against an enemy enabled to bring one-half the population under arms with the other half held to labor, with no cost except that of bare subsistence for the armed moiety. Still less can we maintain this contest if all we do must necessarily enrage and alienate the military half, while we do nothing to conciliate but very much to disaffect the laboring half.
I have not time to argue this out or even to qualify as might be necessary to avoid captious objection as to the feasibility of my statement. Of its substantial accuracy I am certain.
As to the border states, even including Arkansas, a different rule may be adopted. In these states the President's plan of compensated emancipation may be adequate to the solution of the slavery question, though I confess my apprehensions that the slave-holders of these states will delay the acceptance of the proposition until it will become impossible to induce the Congress to vote the compensation. Should compensated emancipation fail in these states, emancipation will not be the less a necessity, and prompt emancipation as a military measure in the Gulf States will facilitate it by affording a convenient and easy outlet for the freed men.
It will not escape your acute observation that military emancipation in the Gulf States will settle or largely contribute to settle the negro question in the free states. I am not myself afraid of the negroes. If they behave themselves and work industriously and honestly I have not the slightest objection to their contributing their industry to the prosperity of the state of which I am a citizen, or to their being protected in
their rights to life, liberty, and pursuit of happiness by the same laws which protect me. But I know that many honest men really think that they are not to be permitted to reside permanently in the Northern States, and I believe myself that if left free to choose most of them will prefer warmer climes to ours. Let, therefore, the South be opened to negro emigration by emancipation along the Gulf, and it is easy to see that the blacks of the North will slide southward, and leave behind them no question to quarrel about as far as they are concerned.
This rough statement presents my general view sufficiently.
Now for its practical application to Louisiana. Of course, if some prudential considerations did not forbid, I should at once, if I were in your place, respectfully notify the slave-holders of Louisiana that henceforth they must be content to pay their laborers wages. This measure would settle it in the minds of the working population of the State that the Union General is their friend; would be apt to secure him a good deal of devotion among them; and when he wanted faithful friends or scouts he could find them. It is quite true that such an order could not be enforced by military powers beyond military lines; but it would enforce itself by degrees a good way beyond them, and would make the extension of the military lines quite easy comparatively.
It may be said the order would be annulled. I think not. It is plain enough now that the annulling of Hunter's order was a mistake. It will not be repeated.
Do the acts of Congress leave, indeed, much room for choice, if these acts are to be faithfully obeyed? The act of last year declared the slaves of all persons, if employed in aid of the rebellion, free. The acts of this last session declare free the slaves of persons who themselves engage in rebellion or aid and abet it; prohibit the return of fugitives by military commanders; and authorize the employment of slaves in the service of the Union either as laborers, or in arms, or both, at the direction of the President. How these acts can be enacted and slavery maintained, especially where slaves are numerous, I am at a loss to conceive.
I think the President feels this difficulty. Hence, he intimates in his letter to Mr. Johnson, while declining to interfere with General Phelps, that it will be well for the Louisianians to make haste back into the Union or worse evils than Gen. Phelps may befall them. Hence the other day, when some conversation
occurred about Gen. Hunter, he was very far from expressing the same dissatisfaction with his course that he would have done four or five weeks ago.
The truth is, my dear General, that there has been a great change in the public mind within the last few weeks. The people are resolved not to give up the struggle for territorial integrity. They mean to keep every inch of American soil in the United States. Whatever stands in the way of this determination has got to get out of the way. If state organizations -- they must fall; if negro slavery -- it must be abolished.
Now, it seems to me that it is just as well to make the shortest possible work of this as the longest possible. Negro slavery should first fall where it has done most mischief, and where its extinction will do most good in weakening rebellion, and incidentally otherwise in the extreme South.
And who better to begin the work than my friend Gen. Butler? Yet I am told that your policemen are now engaged all the time in returning fugitives to masters, provided only they take the oath. Let me beg of you, as one who greatly esteems you and greatly desires your increasing honor and affection among your countrymen, -- let me beg you to put a stop to this: simply see that the acts of Congress are carried out in good faith. It would hardly be too much to ask you to call, like Jackson, colored soldiers to the defence of the Union; but you must judge of this. Of one thing be assured -- you can hardly go too far to satisfy the exigency of public sentiment now.
You must determine in the exercise of your own good judgment what prudence will permit; but as far as prudence allows you may certainly well go.
I have had a great deal of practical experience. I have observed opinions long and closely. I think myself tolerably cool and practical. At any rate, I have not made any failures thus far. And I give you in this letter hastily, indeed, and roughly, but with substantial accuracy, I think, my deliberate judgments.
Whatever you may think of them, believe me, dear general, with the sincerest esteem and admiration.
Your friend, S. P. Chase

My dear Sir: Yours of the 16th by the hand of Governor Shepley is received.
It seems the Union feeling in Louisiana is being crushed out by the course of General Phelps. Please pardon me for believing that it is a false pretence. The people of Louisiana -- all intelligent people everywhere -- know full well that I never had a wish to touch the foundations of their society, or any right of theirs. With perfect knowledge of this, they forced me to send armies among them, and it is their own fault, not mine, that they are annoyed by the presence of General Phelps. They also know the remedy -- know how to be cured of General Phelps. Remove the necessity of his presence. And might it not be well for them to consider whether they have not already had time enough to do this? If they can conceive of anything worse than General Phelps within my power, would they not better be looking out for it? They very well know the way to avert all this is simply to take their place in the Union upon the old terms. If they will not do this, should they not receive harder blows rather than lighter ones? You are ready to say I apply to friends what is due to enemies. I distrust the wisdom if not the sincerity of friends who would hold my hands while my enemies stab me. This appeal of professed friends has paralyzed me more in the struggle than any other one thing. You remember telling me, the day after
the Baltimore mob in April, 1861, that it would crush all Union feeling in Maryland for me to attempt bringing troops over Maryland soil to Washington. I brought the troops notwithstanding, and yet there was Union feeling enough left to elect a legislature the next autumn which in turn elected a very excellent Union U. S. Senator.
I am a patient man -- always willing to forgive on the Christian terms of repentance, and also to give ample time for repentance. Still I must save the Government if possible. What I cannot do of course I will not do; but it may as well be understood, once for all, that I shall not surrender this game leaving any available card unplayed.
Yours Truly, A. Lincoln
Private. Washington, D. C., July 28th, 1862
Cuthbert Bullett, Esq., New Orleans, La.
Sir: The copy of a letter addressed to yourself by Mr. Thomas J. Durant has been shown to me. The writer appears to be an able, a dispassionate, and an entirely sincere man. The first part of the letter is devoted to an effort to show that the secession ordinance of Louisiana was adopted against the will of a majority of the people. This is probably true; and in that fact may be found some instructions. Why did they allow the ordinance to go into effect? Why did they not assert themselves? Why stand passive and allow themselves to be trodden down by a minority? Why did they not hold popular meetings, and have a convention of their own, to express and enforce the true sentiment of the State? If pre-organization was against them, then why not do this now that the United States Army is present to protect them? The paralysis -- the dead palsy -- of the Government in this whole struggle is that this class of men will do nothing for the government, nothing for themselves, except demanding that the government shall not strike its open enemies, lest they be struck by accident.
Mr. Durant complains that in various ways the relation of Master and Slave is disturbed by the presence of our Army; and he considers it particularly vexatious that this, in part, is done under cover of an act of Congress, while constitutional guaranties are suspended on the plea of Military necessity.
The truth is, that what is done, and omitted, about slaves, is done and omitted on the same military necessity. It is a Military necessity to have men and money; and we can get neither, in sufficient numbers, or amounts, if we keep from, or drive from our lines Slaves coming to them. Mr. Durant cannot be ignorant of the pressure in this direction, nor of my efforts to hold it within bounds, till he and such as he shall have time to help themselves.
I am not posted to speak understandingly on all the police regulations of which Mr. Durant complains. If experience shows any one of them to be wrong, let them be set right. I think I can perceive, in that freedom of trade which Mr. Durant urges, that he would relieve both friends and enemies from the pressure of blockade. By this he would serve the enemy more effectively than the enemy is able to serve himself. I do not say or believe that to serve the enemy is the purpose of Mr. Durant, or that he is conscious of any purpose other than National and patriotic ones. Still, if there were a class of men who, having no choice of sides in the contest, were anxious only to have quiet and comfort for themselves while it rages, and to fall in with the victorious side at the end of it, without loss to themselves, their advice as to the mode of conducting the contest would be precisely such as his is. He speaks of no duty -- apparently thinks of none -- resting upon Union men. He even thinks it injurious to the Union cause that they should be restrained in trade and passage without taking sides. They are to touch neither a sail or a pump, but to be merely passengers -- dead heads at that -- to be carried snug and dry, throughout the storm, and safely landed right side up. Nay more; even a mutineer is to go untouched lest these sacred passengers receive an additional wound.
Of course the rebellion will never be suppressed in Louisiana if the professed Union men there will neither help to do it, nor permit the government to do it without their help.
Now, I think the true remedy is very different from what is suggested by Mr. Durant. It does not lie in rounding the rough angles of the War, but in removing the necessity for the war.
The people of Louisiana who wish protection to person and property have but to reach forth their hands and take it. Let them, in good faith, reinaugurate the national authority, and set up a State Government conforming thereto under the
Constitution. They know how to do it, and can have the protection of the Army while doing it.
The Army will be withdrawn so soon as such State Government can dispense with its presence; and the people of the State can then, upon the old Constitutional terms, govern themselves to their own liking. This is very simple and easy.
If they will not do this, if they prefer to hazard all for the sake of destroying the government, it is for them to consider whether it is probable I will surrender the government to save them from losing all. If they decline what I suggest, you scarcely need to ask what I will do. What would you do in my position? Would you drop the war where it is? or would you prosecute it in future with elder stalk squirts, charged with rose water? Would you deal lighter blows than heavier ones? Would you give up the contest, leaving any available means unapplied?
I am in no boastful mood. I shall not do more than I can, and shall do all I can to save the government, which is my sworn duty as well as my personal inclination.
I shall do nothing in malice. What I deal with is too vast for malicious dealing.
Yours truly, A. Lincoln"

General: I have the honor respectfully to lay before you the following facts.
After running the blockade at Vicksburg, my Orders were to proceed to Baton Rouge, raking in supplies, and then to
ascend the Mississippi, constantly cruising between this point and Vicksburg.
The Gun Boats ""Katahdin"" and ""Kenio,"" also the Ram ""Sumpter,"" were left with me here as a protecting force -- the two former Boats have their machinery so deranged that they are absolutely useless for active service until thoroughly overhauled and repaired. The ""Sumpter"" has but four men, and the Capt. of her is the only Officer free from sickness.
There are two Rebel Gun Boats upon the Red River which should be seen to, but with my present Force it would be impracticable to attack them with success without some other light-draught Gun Boats, the low stage of water in the Red River would prevent the ""Essex"" going up.
The enemy are also fortifying at ""Ellis"" Cliffs, some below Natchez, and unless speedily seen to will eventually cause much trouble.
A powerful Steam Tug to tow the ""Essex"" up the Mississippi, and also to convey sufficient Coal supply, I respectfully solicit may be sent me as early as practicable. In the immediate neighborhood of this city large bodies of rebel troops are concentrating, and I would respectfully suggest the immediate fortification of the place, both of the land and river side. The Ram ""Arkansas"" is still above water, and could without doubt, if the ""Essex"" were absent, retake the city.

Sir: I beg leave to enclose to you copies of orders and correspondence with General Phelps upon the subject of arming and employing the negroes.
Gen. Phelps, without orders and without my knowledge, has organized five companies of Negroes, and the first official information I had of his doings in that behalf was a requisition for arms and equipments there.
It became more necessary, in my judgment, to employ them differently, and I thought by that means I would find employment for all, not raising the question offensively between Gen. Phelps and myself until it was settled at Washington. Therefore I sent the order to employ the negroes without sending an answer to his requisition. But his letter of resignation has left me no choice but insist that my order should be obeyed. I submit the whole matter to the department. I need not discuss it. Gen. Shepley, who has been with you, can do it much better than I can Mr. Roselius, whom I have sent you by the ""Connecticut,"" can tell you much more fully than it were possible to do in a despatch what has been the effect of the course of Gen. Phelps.
An insurrection broke out amongst the negroes a few miles up the river, which caused the women of that neighborhood to apply to an armed boat belonging to us, passing down, for aid, and the incipient revolt was stopped by informing the negroes that we should repel an attack by them upon the women and children.
All is for the determination of the department, to which I shall give the fullest obedience. I have the honor to be

General: By the act of Congress, as I understand it, the President of the United States alone has the authority to employ Africans in arms as part of the Military forces of the United States. Every law up to this time, raising volunteer or Militia forces, has been opposed to their employment. The President has not as yet indicated his purpose to employ the Africans in arms.
The arms, clothing, and camp equipage which I have here for Louisiana Volunteers, is, by the letter of the Secretary of War, expressly limited to white soldiers, so that I have no authority to divert them however much I may desire so to do.
I do not think you are empowered to organize into Companies Negroes, and drill them as a Military organization, as I am not surprised but unexpectedly informed you have done. I cannot sanction this course of action as at present advised, specially when we have need of the services of the Blacks (who are being sheltered upon the outskirts of your Camp), as you will see by the orders for their employment sent you by the Assistant Acting Adj't Gen'l.

Brig. Gen. Phelps, Comdg. U. S. Forces at Camp Parapet
General: I am somewhat surprised to receive your resignation for the reasons stated.
When you were put in command at Camp Parapet, I sent Lieut. Weitzel, my Chief Engineer, to make a reconnoissance of the lines of Carrolton, and I understand it was agreed between you and the Engineer that a removal of the wood between Lake Ponchartrain and the right of your intrenchment was a necessary military precaution. The work could not be done at the time because of the stage of water and the want of men. But now both water and men concur. You have
500 Africans organized into Companies, you write me. This work they are fitted to do. It must either be done by them or my soldiers, now drilled and disciplined.
You have said the location is unhealthy to the soldier. It is not to the negro. Is it not best that these unemployed Africans should do this matter at the present time? -- because there are reports of demonstrations to be made on your lines by the rebels, and in my judgment it is a matter of necessary precaution thus to clear the right of your line, so that you can receive the proper aid from the Gunboats on the Lake, besides preventing the enemy from having cover. To do this, the Negroes ought to be employed, and in so employing them I see no evidence of ""slave-driving"" or employing you as a slave driver.
The soldiers of the Army of the Potomac did this very thing last summer in front of Arlington Heights. Are Negroes any better than they?
Because of an order to do this necessary thing, to protect your front threatened by the enemy, you tender your resignation and ask immediate leave of absence. I assure you I did not expect this either from your courage, your patriotism, or your good sense. To resign in the face of an enemy has not been the highest plaudit to a soldier, specially when the reason assigned is that he is ordered to do that which a recent act of Congress has specially authorized a Commander to do, i. e. employ the Africans to do the necessary work about a Camp or upon fortifications.
General, your resignation will not be accepted by me; leave of absence will not be granted, and you will see to it that any orders, thus necessary for the defence of the City, are faithfully and diligently executed, upon the responsibility that a soldier in the field owes to his superior.
I will see that all proper requisitions for the food, shelter, and clothing for these negroes at work are at once filled by the proper departments.
You will also send out a proper guard to protect the laborers against the Guerilla force, if any there may be in the neighborhood. I am,

Sir: Two communications from you of this date have this moment been received. One of them relates to the raising of Volunteer or Militia forces, stating that ""I must desist from the formation of any negro military organization,"" and the other declaring in a spirit contrary to all usages of military service, and all the rights and liberties of a citizen of a free Government, that my resignation will not be accepted by you, that a leave of absence until its acceptance by the President will not be granted me, and that I must see to it that your orders which I could not obey without becoming a slave myself are ""faithfully and diligently executed.""
It can be of but little consequence to me as to what kind of slavery I am to be subjected, whether to African slavery or to that which you thus so offensively propose to me, giving me an order wholly opposed to my convictions of right as well as of the higher scale of public necessities in the case, and insisting with my complying with it faithfully and diligently, allowing me no room to escape with my convictions or my principles at any sacrifice that I may make. I cannot submit to either kind of slavery, and cannot, therefore, for a double reason, comply with your order of the 31st of July, in complying with which I should submit to both kinds, -- both to African slavery and to that (to) which you resort in its defence. Desiring to the last of serving the public interest involved, I appeal to your sense of justice to reconsider your decision, and make the most of the cause out of the sacrifice which I offer, by granting the quiet, proper, and customary action upon my resignation. By refusing my request you would subject me to great inconvenience, without, as far as I can see, any advantage to yourself or the service.
With the view of securing myself a tardy justice in the case, being remote from the Capitol, where the transmission of the mails is remarkably irregular and uncertain, and in order to give you every assurance that my resignation is tendered in strict compliance with paragraph 29 of the regulations, to be unconditional and immediate, -- I herewith enclose a Copy for the Adjutant General of the Army which I desire may be forwarded to him, to be laid before the President for as early action in the case as his Excellency may be
pleased to accord. And as my position, sufficiently unpleasant already, promises to become much more so still by the course of action I am sorry to find you deem it proper to pursue, I urgently request his Excellency, by a speedy acceptance of my commission, to liberate me from that sense of suffocation, from that darkling sense of bondage and enthralment, which, it appears to me, like the snake around the muscles and sinews of Laokoon, is entangling and deadening the energies of the Government and the Country, when a decisive act might cut the evils and liberate us from their baneful and fascinating influence forever.
In conclusion of this communication, and I should also hope of my services in this Department, I deem it my duty to state, lest it otherwise might not come to your notice, that several parties of the free colored men of New Orleans have recently come to consult me on the propriety of raising one or two regiments of Volunteers from their class of the population for the defence of the Government and good order, and that I have recommended them to propose the measure to you, having no power to act upon it myself.

General: Immediately upon my arrival I proceeded to Washington, and there had an interview with the President and Secretaries of State and War. I stated to them fully the condition and wants of Louisiana.
They were impressed with the necessity of sending more troops, and promised to send the fifteen thousand I asked for when they could get them to send. But they said more troops were called for now in every Department, and it would be impossible to send them at present.
In relation to the negro question, they frankly stated the difficulties which surrounded them, and gave me discretion to act as I thought best, which will be to continue the policy pursued by you up to this time. I will explain this more fully to you when I return.
I infer from what was said upon the subject of Brigadier Generals, that they will send out any two you may designate that are available.
I suggested the appointment of Weitzel, and Stanton received it very favorably, and I think if you make a formal request for his appointment he will receive it.
The Secretary of War suggested that I had better return home and wait a few days, and he would send despatches and a messenger to me when his despatches were ready. I reached home Tuesday night (29th), and now (August 2nd), not having heard from the Secretary, I shall leave Monday morning for Washington direct, and after remaining there one day leave as soon as possible for New Orleans.
You can have no conception how strong and universal, with the people, is the feeling of approbation and appreciation of your course in New Orleans. They all contrast what has been done in New Orleans, with the insufficient force and scanty means of transportation, with the failures in Virginia of such a vast Army, so magnificently supplied with all the appliances of modern warfare. The contrast is so striking in
your favor that the remark is almost universal that ""if Butler had been in command he would have got into Richmond before this time some how.""
Mortar fleet Porter has been attacking you in Washington. I found he had been doing this before he arrived, and I presume, as he has been in Washington since, he has repeated his attacks. He has been charging you with employing tug boats and steamers for private speculations, and neglecting to supply him with means to tow his vessels. I told the Secretary it was false, that Porter was a humbug, and explained to him Porter's cowardice about the ""Louisiana,"" and told him how invariably you had rendered to Porter and the Army every possible facility.
When I return to Washington I will find out what new lies Porter has told on his arrival there, and will endeavor to set history right with the President and Secretary of War. I believe Porter and his motives are pretty well appreciated now.
I suggested Cushing as Brigadier General, but found it hopeless to attempt anything in that quarter.

Phelps has gone crazy. He is organizing the negroes into regiments, and wants me to arm them. There has been a slight insurrection up the Coast, as it is called, meaning twenty miles up the river.

General: I received your note by the hand of John Mann, who was in my confidential service. While his information may be relied upon as correct, yet all the inferences may not be which he draws.
The truth is this, as I gather it from various sources. On the 25th of July I sent an expedition of 500 men on an expedition around the Lake at Mandeville and Madisonville. The movement was delayed 48 hours, and in that time word was sent to the enemy that it was to go out. Thereupon Breckinridge was telegraphed down to Camp Moore with four Regiments to proceed to Madisonville, but it so happened that Col. McMillan on the same day sent out to the Amite River a reconnoitering party of two companies, and they made an attack on a Guerilla Camp there.
News of this came to Camp Moore, and they concluded that the expedition to Madisonville was but a feint while the real attack was to be Camp Moore, immediately counter-marched to get back to repel the expected assault upon the Camp.

General Orders No. 55
It appears that the need of relief to the destitute poor of the city requires more extended measures and greater outlay than have yet been made.
It becomes a question in justice upon whom should this burden fall. Clearly upon those who have brought this great calamity upon their fellow-citizens.
It should not be borne by taxation of the whole municipality, because the middling and working-men have never been heard at the ballot-box, unawed by threats and unmenaced by ""Thugs"" and paid assassins of conspirators against peace and good order. Besides, more than the vote that was claimed for secession have taken the oath of allegiance to the United States.
The United States Government does its share when it protects, defends, and preserves the people in the enjoyment of law, order, and calm quiet. Those who have brought upon the city this stagnation of business, this desolation of the hearthstone, this starvation of the poor and helpless, should, as far as they may be able, relieve these distresses.
There are two classes whom it would seem peculiarly fit should at first contribute to this end. First, those individuals and corporations who have aided the rebellion with their means; and second, those who have endeavored to destroy the commercial prosperity of the city, upon which the welfare of its inhabitants depend.
It is brought to the knowledge of the Commanding General that a subscription of twelve hundred and fifty thousand dollars was made by the corporate bodies, business firms, and persons whose names are set forth in schedule ""A"" annexed to this order, and that sum placed in the hands of an illegal body known as the ""Committee of Public Safety,"" for the treasonable purpose of defending the city against the Government of the United States, under whose humane rule the city of New Orleans had enjoyed such unexampled prosperity that her warehouses were filled with trade of all nations who came to share her freedom, to take part in the benefits of her commercial superiority, and thus she was made the representative mart of the world.
The stupidity and wastefulness with which this immense
sum was spent was only equalled by the folly which led to its being raised at all. The subscribers to this fund, by this very act, betray their treasonable designs and their ability to pay at least a much smaller tax for the relief of their destitute and starving neighbors.
Schedule ""B"" is a list of Cotton Brokers, who, claiming to control that great interest in New Orleans, to which she is so much indebted for her wealth, published in the newspapers, in October, 1861, a manifesto deliberately advising the planters not to bring their produce to the city, a measure which brought ruin at the same time upon the producer and the city.
This act sufficiently testifies the malignity of these traitors, as well to the Government as their neighbors, and it is to be regretted that their ability to relieve their fellow-citizens is not equal to their facilities for injuring them.
In taxing both these classes to relieve the suffering poor of New Orleans, yea, even though the needy be the starving wives and children of those in arms at Richmond and elsewhere against the United States, it will be impossible to make a mistake save in having the assessment too easy and the burden too light.
It is therefore Ordered
1st. That the sums in schedules annexed, marked ""A"" and ""B,"" set against the names of the several persons, business firms, and corporations herein described, be and hereby are assessed upon each respectively.
2d. That said sums be paid to Lieut. David C. G.

Love to all -- Kiss the children. Write me every day, grow fat and saucy -- and tell me how I can get home to you out of this. We have not heard a word till today. The mail is just in -- the first mail since the 6th of July. Thirty days without a mail! I am longing for it to be opened, as I shall get a letter from you, one at least, I hope more. I shall have trouble with Phelps. He is mad as a March Hare on the ""nigger question."" He is arming them against all law, and refuses to have them work. My respect for him will lead me to treat him very tenderly but firmly, and I hope involve myself no more than is absolutely necessary for my duty. That I will do in any event. All else is well here. The Rebels threaten Baton Rouge, but I do not believe in an attack. Let them come on, I want a fight. All else is well.

To Brig. Gen. Phelps
General: Your communication of today has been received. I had forwarded your resignation on the day it was received to the President of the U. S., so that there will be no occasion of forwarding a duplicate. General, not at liberty to accept your resignation, I cannot, consistently with my duty and the orders from the War Department, grant you a leave of absence until it is accepted by the President of the U. S., for want of Officers to supply your place. I see nothing unusual, nor do I intend anything so, in the refusal to accept the resignation of an officer when his place cannot be at the present moment supplied.
I pray you to understand that there was nothing intended to be offensive to you in either the matter or manner of my communication in directing you to cease military Organizations of the negroes. I do only carry out the law of Congress as I understand it, and in doing which I have no choice. I can see neither African nor other slavery in the Commander of a Post clearing from the front of his line, by means of able-bodied men under his control, the trees and underbrush which would afford cover and shelter to his enemies in case of attack, especially when the very measure is a precautionary one advised by yourself, and while in deference to your age and experience
as a soldier, and the appreciation I have of your many good qualities of heart, I have withdrawn and do withdraw anything you may find offensive in my communication, still I must request a categorical answer to this question: Will you or will you not employ a proper portion of the negroes in cutting down the trees which afford cover to the enemy in front and right of your line?
I pray you to observe that if there is anything of wrong in this order, that wrong is mine, for you have sufficiently protested against it. You are not responsible for it more than the hand that executes it -- it can offend neither your political nor moral sense. With sentiments of the utmost kindness and respect, I am,
Your obedient Servant, Benj. F. Butler"

Dear Genl.: I send you enclosed herewith the President's order, which came in this morning's mail, before you make your final answer to my official communication.
You will see that I cannot do otherwise than I have done, and I beseech you do not put yourself in an attitude apparently hostile to me, when the only feelings I hold toward you are those of kindness and good will.
I have in this frank manner written to assure you that I only wish to carry out the orders of the Government, and not to embarrass you.
I would like to meet you in personal conversation to see if I might not aid you in avoiding this difficulty. Believe me,
Your friend, Benj. F."
"August 6, 1862","Camp Parapet, August [6th], 1862
Maj. Gen. B. F. Butler, Comd'g, Dept. of the Gulf at New Orleans, La.
Sir: I have the honor to acknowledge the receipt of your communication of yesterday, proposing a question for a categorical answer, which came to hand at a quarter before one o'clock P. M. to-day.
To propose a question either specific or abstract of obedience to orders, after I had tendered my resignation immediate and unconditional, seems to me hardly compatible with the ""sentiments
of kindness"" that you express. If I am to be detained here against my wishes because at present my place cannot be supplied, then at least I ought not to be troubled with unnecessary issues between my sense of obedience to orders and my convictions and principles. I am willing to fill a place temporarily and perform the routinary duties of my profession until the acceptance of my resignation; but as I am left wholly destitute of the proper power and authority to meet the urgent and practical questions that come every day for solution, it would seem to me idle to comply with merely one measure among many, especially when we have work enough already for our negroes to do, and when the Order proposed, if extended to other obstructions as well as trees, would occasion a great amount of unnecessary labor and destruction.
My dear Sir, it is not a question of obedience to Orders between us. I fully appreciate the difficulties of your position, and the varied abilities, patriotism, and untiring diligence which you have shown in meeting them; and it is with great reluctance and regret that I have to trouble you with anything my own; but at a crisis in our national affairs so important as this, I should not be doing my duty either to the Country or to the Government, I should mislead them both, were I to remain quietly at my post with the semblance but without the power of fulfilling the duties incumbent upon it. I should endanger and complicate public interests in this way rather than serve them.
The distance of this Station from the Capitol of the country, the irregularity and studied uncertainty of the mails; the ungenial character of Latin laws and education and slave labor to democratic institutions; the speculating character of the people habituated to conspiratorial associations, idle combinations, and fraudulent collusions, -- all these and many other elements of disorder and opposition to legitimate authority, Lilliputian as they are when viewed by themselves, seem threatening to entangle the feeble, hesitating, and undecided action of the Government, and render its great and beneficent power of no avail. As it is, we seem to be in a foreign country rather than in the United States, not so much from the character of the people as from the want of action of the Government upon it.
You ask me whether I will obey a certain Order or not. With perfect respect and deference for yourself and your position, I beg to be permitted in return to submit the following
propositions to his Excellency the President of the United States, as those under which I could alone consent to serve.
1st. The people purchased a large region of country called Louisiana, which at the time of purchase embraced a very considerable portion of the South West, and they have a right to this Territory for the purposes designed by their constitution, viz. to secure the blessings of liberty to themselves and their posterity.
2nd. The people are temporarily withheld from a full, perfect, and peaceable possession of this territory by a few ambitious leaders and their deluded partisans.
3rd. Every State of the Union is bound to furnish her share of taxes and her quota of men for the suppression of domestic insurrection, and the quota of men of the Slave States should be based upon the total number of whites and three-fifths of all other persons in those States.
4th. Society here is on the verge of dissolution, and it is the true policy of the Government to seize upon the chief elements of disorder and anarchy, and employ them in favor of law and order. The African, ignorant and benighted, yet newly-awakened to liberty, threatens to be a fearful element of ruin and disaster, and the best way to prevent it is to arm and organize him on the side of the Government.
5th. The Slave States have already gone through the chief suffering incident to a state of revolution; and to return them to their former condition would be as impolitic as it would be cruel and impossible.
6th. The system of labor in the South is ripe for and demands a change, and a transition from forced to paid labor is of easy and necessary accomplishment.
7th. Military art and science, the most potent and perhaps the only rudimentary element of civilizing power which has not yet been brought to the African during his bondage in America, is essential for extending the Colony of Liberia and opening up to civilization the cane and cotton lands of Africa.
Enclosing herewith a report of Major Peck which discloses the condition of things on the borders of Lake Ponchartrain, I have the honor to remain, with sentiments of high esteem,
Very respectfully, Your Obt. Servt.

Captain R. S. Davis, A. A. A. Gen.
Captain: I have the honor to report that an attack was made early yesterday morning by a Confederate force of about 10 Regiments, under Command of Maj. Gen'l. J. C. Breckinridge, and that, after a fight of four hours duration and of great severity, the enemy was repulsed.
I regret to state that Brig. Gen'l. Williams was killed on the field by a rifle ball through the chest.
During the battle, our forces were obliged to retire about a quarter of a mile from our original position, and the enemy
were thus able to occupy temporarily the Camps of the 21st Indiana, 7th Vermont, and 14th Maine Regiments, and to destroy much of the baggage and Camp Equipage. They were, however, driven out, but, our numbers being much exhausted by fatigue and heat, it was deemed inexpedient to pursue.
I am unable as yet to give a report of our casualties which, I am sorry to say, are considerable. The enemy has retired several miles, and from all I can learn are still retiring. I am expecting it possible they may receive reinforcements, and am disposing my troops in the strongest positions. Our force engaged numbered less than 2500, the enemy had about 5000 with twelve or fourteen field pieces and some Cavalry.
The Ram ""Arkansas"" approached with intentions of engaging our gunboats, but grounded above the point at a distance of about 6 miles, and to-day was engaged by the iron-clad ""Essex"" and destroyed.
Enclosed is a copy of a communication received by Flag of Truce from Maj. Gen. Breckinridge, and my reply thereto. You will see by the latter that Brig. Gen. Clark and his Aid de Camp have delivered themselves up as prisoners of War. I have also fully 70 wounded prisoners that were left on the field, also about 30 captured.

General Orders No. 56
The Commanding General announces to the Army of the Gulf the sad event of the death of Brig. Gen. Thomas Williams, commanding Second Brigade, in Camp, at Baton Rouge.
The victorious achievement -- the repulse of the division of Major General Breckinridge by the troops led on by Gen. Williams, and the destruction of the mail-clad ""Arkansas"" by Capt. Porter of the Navy -- is made sorrowful by the fall of our brave, gallant, and successful fellow-soldier.
Gen. Williams graduated at West Point in 1837; at once joined the 4th Artillery in Florida, where he served with distinction; was thrice breveted for gallant and meritorious services in Mexico, as a member of Gen. Scott's staff. His life was that of a soldier devoted to his country's service. His
country mourns in sympathy with his wife and children, now that country's care and precious charge.
We, his companions in arms, who had learned to love him, weep the true friend, the gallant gentleman, the brave soldier, the accomplished officer, the pure patriot and victorious hero, and the devoted Christian. All, and more, went out when Williams died. By a singular felicity, the manner of his death illustrated each of these generous qualities.
The chivalrie American gentleman, he gave up the vantage of the cover of the houses of the city forming his lines in the open field -- lest the women and children of his enemies should be hurt in the fight!
A good general, he made his dispositions and prepared for battle at the break of day, when he met his foe!
A brave soldier, he received the death-shot leading his men.
A patriot hero, he was fighting the battle of his country, and died as went up the cheer of victory!
A Christian, he sleeps in the hope of a blessed Redeemer!
His virtues we cannot exceed -- his example we may emulate, -- and, mourning his death, we pray, ""may our last end be like his.""
The customary tribute of mourning will be worn by the officers in the Department.

Dearest: I have been alone today, no one in the house but myself and servants. Tonight I feel tenderly toward you,
inexpressibly kind and pitiful. What happiness it would be to see you coming up the avenue, even greater, that there would be none to greet you but me. We should not say much, happy enough to sit down together, and look on one of the loveliest views in nature, satisfied that this is home; and when you are a little more weary of the turmoil of life, and the tempests of feeling have ceased to afflict me, the home, where we shall find peace and content, a deeper, fuller happiness than we have yet known, for you will yet believe, time will bring faith, that the love (though it is kindled on earth) that has absorbed the highest and noblest emotions of our nature is yet a spark from heaven, that will glow with finer glory when it has passed the ordeal of earth, and will help to lift us to heaven from whence it came. Do you wish to have me with you again? I will come whenever you wish me. It will not be so fearful as before. I will take a favorable time and escape the storms. Fisher has bought a steamer and will have her freighted by Monday. This letter will go by her. He is trying, too, for a sailing vessel, to purchase it. And has spoken to Thurston about the horses, but is confident they cannot be got there for the price you mention. The steamer is an English vessel that I think he found at New Bedford. I think he is running a great risk, but these are times when men will venture all, the chances are great either to win largely or to lose utterly. Whitney is engaged with him in the purchase. Farragut we hear has gone down to New Orleans. Why may not the ""Arkansas,"" when repaired, follow and drive him out of the river and take you all prisoners?
Gen'l. Shepley has not been to see me. I hear from his daughter Nelly he is already on his way back. Emancipation, and arming the negroes is held in check for a little, the border states will not submit to it, soon as there is a plausible hope of success it will be brought forward again. The only man in the Administration who approves is Seward. If you look at Port Royal you will see that Hunter is kept in place, and carries out all that his Proclamation put forth. The President's veto was not decisive. Phelps' policy prevails instead of yours. The abolitionists will have this a war to free the slaves at once if possible, nothing else is thought of. The Administration will assent to it just as fast and as far as the country will sustain it. It has taken a step or two in advance, and been obliged to draw back. But events may give the opportunity. They will be seized on fast as they arise. How strange it is
to be alone in the house. I thought I should be better pleased with it for a little while. Haggerty is nearly at New Orleans by this time. I thought, when I gave him the letter, I could never while away the time till he reached there, but it is nearly over, -- you will comply with my request soon as you have my letter, and that trouble will be done away with. I shall be happier when I think he has reached there. Paul has written a few lines in pencil, but gave up, thinking it too unworthy to send. I shall enclose it. With a little help it might have been quite neat. He is very proud of your letter to him, and requests it may be put with the one from Capt. George, about the fox. He desires me to tell you that he won the prizes for the best lessons. Benny was almost in doubt about going away, for fear he might lose the sight of his present when it first comes. What became of the pearls, -- that were captured with the plate? I think ladies can never hear of such pretty baubles without a desire to behold them, and it is apt to increase with indulgence. I wonder if you really miss me, or if you only say so because I shall be sorry if you do not. Ah me! there is such a wide difference between man's thought and woman's. If it is as healthy as you say, why might I not return at any time? Blanche goes back to school in little more than a week after her return. She seems rather languid, and is not quite so straight as she was. I dread another year of confinement for her. If she were through with this year I would take her with me wherever I went. You see I am at the end of my sheet. Only room for

Pope and several other Volunteer Major Generals have had it done. I thought of asking Mr. Stanton myself (with what influence I could bring to bear here) to do it, but have concluded that it would be more seemly, were it done at all, that it be done by you.

At present I am ranked by Turner, Shaffer, and Kinsman, and of course it would be pleasant for me (modest as the remark may seem) to have a commission antedating theirs. So much plain speaking on that subject. One more of the same sort, for there's a young gentleman of this city, Frederick Martin, that perhaps will go out with me, for whom I would like to ask you to retain a First Lieutenancy in one of your new Louisiana Regiments.
Dr. Kellogg will go out to New Orleans next week. I hope he will prove, what I predict, a valuable man. He received your order to report, and will go at the earliest possible moment, and much regrets that he couldn't have settled up his affairs earlier than next week. Sent yesterday (it was not published this morning and perhaps will not be) to the Herald a communication in answer to that infamous charge of corruption made by Whipple against you (before the Contract Investigating Committee) in the contract for hats.
It is an unmitigated lie to all intents and purposes, and no doubt Whipple knows it; for the remarks that were made in jest in your Office that day never could have been taken in earnest by him. He got angry with Captain George at Lowell, and determined to make a good advertisement by implicating the whole establishment.

I have therefore, by investing that money in the City Bonds, not done any more than minding my own business and doing my duty according to my humble knowledge.

"August 9, 1862","Headquarters Department of the Gulf, New Orleans, Augst. 9th, 1862
Hon. Edwin M. Stanton, Secretary of War
Owing to the withdrawal of the fleet from before Vicksburg, it may become necessary to return Williams'. Brigade at Baton Rouge.
The services before Vicksburg had weakened very much that force by sickness, the overflow of the river, and the number of dead animals in the swamps, made a fearful malaria, but which, while it caused illness in almost the entire command, did not produce a large mortality. The healthy air and water at Baton Rouge rapidly recruited the troops.
The cessation of operations at Vicksburg allowed the enemy to concentrate a very large part of his available force at Camp Moore, about 60 miles from Baton Rouge. From thence he marched to attack the Post, and on the morning of the 5th instant appeared before our lines.
His force consisted of 2 Louisiana Regts., 2 Miss. Regts., 2 Tennessee Regts., an Alabama, a Texas and a Georgia Regt., 14 pieces of Artillery, and a large force of Guerilla Cavalry. These were under Command of Major General Breckinridge, Brig. Gens. Ruggles, Robert G. Helme, Allen, and Clark. They were supported by the Ram ""Arkansas,"" which inspired them with the greatest hope and the utmost confidence in their attack. To oppose this formidable force, Brig. General Williams had the 14th Maine, 7th Vermont, 9 companies of the 9th Conn., the 21st Indiana, 4th Wisconsin, and 6th Michigan Regts., Nim's. Everett's, Manning's Mass. Batteries, and Magee's Company of Mass. Cavalry, nearly one half of whom were on the sick list.
Leaving two Regiments in the village for a Reserve, with high chivalry Gen'l Williams formed his lines at daybreak nearly a mile beyond the town, in an admirably chosen position.
The enemy made the attack in two divisions on the right and left, and massing his forces endeavored to force our inferior numbers back, by extending his lines to flank us. His first attack was partially successful by the failure of our Regiment to do its duty. The enemy was repulsed, however, thrice over returned to the charge; upon the final repulse, after 6 hours of continuous fighting, retired from the field, and sent a flag of truce for leave to bury their dead (A copy of the Correspondence is annexed).
The Boat which brought down the despatches to me from Col. Cahill, upon whom the Command developed after the death of General Williams, collided with the Gunboat ""Oneida"" and sunk, so that I am not able by this mail to give the details, as I hope to do by the next despatch. Our loss was very heavy, say 90 killed and 250 wounded. We mourn the loss of General Williams, Col. Roberts, 7th Vermont, killed, Lt. Col. Keith, 21st Indiana, severely wounded, a large number of lower officers killed and wounded, whose names I am unable to give for the reason above stated, and upon such matter a mistake should not be made.
The casualties of the enemy were very much larger. They have lost Brig. Gen. Clark wounded, probably mortally, and a prisoner with his aid; Brig. Gen'l. Allen killed, Brig. Gen'l. Helme disabled by a fall from his horse; Brig. Gen'l Ruggles is reported dead, and a very large number of field and line officers killed and wounded. We have buried already more then 300 of their dead, and they have left their wounded in every cabin on their line of retreat. Their killed and wounded more than equal one-half of our men actually engaged against them. The enemy's forces were at least 6000 effective men, while we had not over 2000 in the action. The necessities of the ground caused General Williams to form his line of battle in rear of the Camps of the 14th Maine and 21st Indiana Regts., so that the enemy for the hour were permitted to occupy these Camps and destroyed much Camp Equipage.
Upon the first report of the engagement reaching me, I sent up Lieut. Weitzel of my Staff to report the condition of affairs, and to see what further dispositions were necessary to meet a renewed attack if any need be feared. Although supported by the rebel Steamers ""Webb"" and ""Music,"" the ""Arkansas"" did not choose to come down and attack our Gunboats, the ""Essex,"" ""Sumter,"" and ""Kenio,"" and so did not coöperate with the land forces.
Flag Officer Farragut went immediately up the river to attack the ""Arkansas."" But upon the 6th the ""Essex"" steamed up to the rebel fleet. The ""Webb"" and ""Music"" fled, and the ""Arkansas,"" after firing a few shots, was on fire and blew up.
Please find appended the reports of Lieut. Weitzel, as well as the General Orders issued from this Department upon the sad event of General Williams' death and the victory at Baton Rouge.
I trust the actions of my brave men will receive your approbation. I have the honor to be

"August 9, 1862","Baton Rouge La., Augst, 9th, 1862
Maj. Genl. B. F. Butler, Commanding Dept. of Gulf
Honored Sir: Having read that Alexander, Napoleon, Washington, and others have at times condescended to receive and hear the opinions of and suggestions of private soldiers on important subjects, and hoping this will not give offense or intrude too much on your valuable time, I venture to write my thoughts, which you can take for what they are worth. The intent of the late attack on this place has changed in appearance very much, and from looking like a desire of the Commanders to make a dashing charge in and out again, for the mere purpose of amazing you, harrassing the Garrison, and troubling the fleet, it now shows itself to be a regular movement of a Division of the Army undoubtedly planned at and ordered from Headquarters at Richmond Va. for some important purpose, the intent of which is only known to the Chiefs.
To enable us to judge of their intentions, we must place ourselves in their position, and consider what we would do, and what good policy and all the precedents in this war justify us in supposing they intend to do. They have never yet risked an encounter without having a position to fall back upon, and routes clear of the Enemy by which to reach it. The Chiefs
of the Rebel army and leaders in the Secession movement know that whatever mercy may be shown to subaltern officers or soldiers, they may expect none, so that, before risking a great Battle between the two grand Armies in and near Richmond, where it is possible they might be defeated and pursued, it would be of the greatest importance for them to have a portion of the Mississippi clear of the Fleet, that they might cross the Army, collected from different points in their march over into the Red River and Texas country, where they could hold out and trouble the Government for a long time, or at least until they could obtain their terms of surrender, or it may be that they expect men and supplies by way of Mexico and Texas, for the crossing of which it would be equally important. But no matter for what purpose, it is evident they intend to take this place and fortify it, so as to keep the Gulf Fleet below here and the upper Fleet above Vicksburg, by doing which they will have Red river and the South West open to them.
Now, Sir, this place can be taken and command of the river obtained in spite of the fleet and the small Garrison here, if the Commander is determined and has the skill and forces to do it with.
If you will look at the map of this place you will see that the principal part of the City is surrounded by a broad and deep hollow on the river side, in which the enemy would be almost secure from the fire of the fleet if the Garrison was driven out, and which would be a good natural base line for a system of approaches to the River. You cannot spare men enough to fight the forces they can bring here, but you have plenty of old 24 and 32 lb. Guns and carriages in and about New Orleans, which are good enough for defence purposes, which, if properly placed around the City on the edge of that hollow or gully with breastworks and rifle pits in front, and the land for about a half mile around cleared of houses, timber, and old fences, the place could be held with the aid of a few Boats against any Army the enemy can at present spare to send here. This would not cost much labor or expense, the unnecessary negroes around here under a fort man assisted by the troops, could do the labor in a few days, for Genl. Gladden of the Rebel Army with half of his Brigade entrenched a part of the Camp near Corinth one and three (1¾) quarters miles long with breastworks five feet high, and rifle pits five feet deep, in less than a week. You have plenty of heavy Artillery men here, who learned their business in the Rebel Service.
There is not a moment to spare, the Enemy is in force all around us, and evidently mean business.
Hoping that this may gain your attention, I remain
Your obedient Servant,
Private J. O'Brien, Camp ""B"" 11th Me. Vols.
P. S. Please excuse the style. I have written the same as I would speak to a comrade, and for God's sake don't expose this, or I will be the jest of the Regiment if you do not approve it.

General Orders No. 57
Soldiers of the Army of the Gulf
Your successes have heretofore been substantially bloodless. Taking and holding the most important strategic and commercial positions with the aid of the gallant Navy, by the wisdom of your combinations and the moral power of your arms, it has been left for the last few days to baptize you in blood.
The Spanish conqueror of Mexico won imperishable renown by landing in that country and burning his transport ships, to cut off all hope of retreat. You, more wise and economical but with equal providence against retreat, sent yours home.
Organized to operate on the sea-coast, you advanced your outposts to Baton Rouge, the capital of the State of Louisiana, more than two hundred and fifty miles into the interior.
Attacked there by a division of our rebel enemies, under command of a Major General recreant to loyal Kentucky, whom some of us would have honored before his apostacy, of doubly superior numbers, you have repulsed in the open field his myrmidons, who took advantage of your sickness from the malaria of the marshes of Vicksburg, to make a cowardly attack.
The Brigade at Baton Rouge has routed the enemy.
He has lost three Brigadier Generals, killed, wounded, and prisoners; many Colonels and field officers. He has more than a thousand killed and wounded.
You have captured three pieces of artillery, six caissons, two stand of colors, and a large number of prisoners.
You have buried his dead on the field of battle, and are caring for his wounded. You have convinced him that you are never so sick as not to fight your enemy if he desires the contest.
You have shown him that if he cannot take an outpost after weeks of preparation, what would be his fate with the main body? If your General should say he was proud of you, it would only be to praise himself; but he will say, he is proud to be one of you.
In this battle, the Northeast and the Northwest mingled their blood on the field -- as they had long ago joined their hearts -- in the support of the Union.
Michigan stood by Maine, Massachusetts supported Indiana, Wisconsin aided Vermont, while Connecticut, represented by the sons of the ever-green shamrock, fought as our fathers did at the Boyne Water.
While we all mourn the loss of many brave comrades, we, who were absent, envy them the privilege of dying upon the battle-field for our country, under the starry folds of her victorious flag.
The colors and guidons of the several corps engaged in the contest will have inscribed on them ""Baton Rouge.""
To complete the victory, the iron-clad steamer ""Arkansas,"" the last naval hope of the rebellion, hardly awaited the gallant attack of the ""Essex,"" but followed the example of her sisters, the ""Merrimac,"" the ""Manassas,"" the ""Mississippi,"" and the ""Louisiana,"" by her own destruction.

Major General B. F. Butler
My dear Sir: You are doubtless rejoiced, like every patriot in the Country, at the two recent calls of the President for additional troops. You may not know the secret springs of these late movements. They come from the people, the loyal masses, rather than from Washington. It would surprise and please you, could you be back here at this time, and observe the serious earnestness of the people. They are everywhere, even in the most secluded and unfrequented rural districts, ready for any necessary sacrifice, and will never be content
till they know there are at least a million men under arms, and that the Government is using so much of the vast resources of the Country as may be necessary to succeed in this war. They see clearly that everything they prize is at stake in this struggle, and that utter ruin and destruction must ultimately follow a failure to crush this rebellion.
I hope that out of the 600,000 fresh troops now being organized for the war, the Department will be largely strengthened, that you may be able to sweep around you at will. You ought to number at least 50,000 good troops; and if it were twice that so much the better.
Permit me to express my gratification at your great success, so far, and your admirable management at New Orleans. I suppose you and your forces have been much exposed, but I hope you will soon be so strongly reinforced as to be able to move at pleasure in any direction, and produce new and marked results.
I beg you to feel fully assured that I shall be happy to aid you in all possible ways. Perhaps no man has been more earnest and persistent than myself in urging our National authorities to make the last two calls for fresh troops. They are both in accordance with letters addressed by me to the President and Secretary of War -- only that I wished the last 300,000 men could have been called out for a longer period than nine months.
I hope the ""Green Mountain Boys"" you have with you uphold the honor and credit of Vermont. The climate, I presume, must be very trying to them, and I see by the papers that the 7th Regiment, near Vicksburg, have suffered a good deal by sickness. But I doubt not you will take all the precautions that circumstances will permit to get them safely through the heated season. If more surgeons are needed, please inform me immediately, and I will send them forthwith to both the Vt. Regiments.
My son, Major Holbrook, of the 7th Regt., I hear is getting on well, which of course is gratifying to me. He is a dear boy to me, General, and I believe he is a good soldier, more accomplished in the military profession than the generality of Volunteers. At any rate, he has had good advantages of instruction heretofore. Please bear him in mind for my sake, as well as his own, and if you can give him opportunities to grow, and to show what is in him, I have no doubt he will gratify you as well as myself, in the performance of duty in responsible positions.
He always had good judgment, considerably in advance of his years.
With my best wishes for your continued success in your responsible position, and for your health and happiness I am, with high regard,
Your friend and Obl. Servant,
Frederick Holbrook"
"August 10, 1862","Sunday evening, Lowell, Aug. 10th, 1862
Dearest: I have been to Dracut and given letters to Mr. Read to be carried in the morning to the Capt. of the vessel Fisher has lately bought. She sails tomorrow for New Orleans. Yet you see I begin writing again this evening. I am still alone in the house. The night is so extremely beautiful I cannot forbear telling you of it. I have opened the window of our room that looks on the greenhouse. Such a flood of light and beauty you never gazed on. The moon is full -- the wind cool and fragrant, waving the long, pendent willows that float like a woman's hair on the sighing breeze. The long, dark shadows sweep over the lawn and roads. It is not calm and still. The deep sighs and whispering among the trees make it a night of strange, mysterious beauty. The air is alive with spirits, agitated with sudden news, they float tremulously in and out among the trees like phantoms as they are. I feel, in gazing, as though I belonged to them, and could easily pass the space and put my hands up on your shoulders and look you in the face. I wonder if you would start back from me, or naturally fold me in your arms. I shall find out by my dreams tonight. Ah, dearest, I wish, and you would be glad to be here tonight.
I began this on Sunday as you see. On Monday morning two letters from you, one saying you had no letters from me for twenty-two days, and the other desiring the children's pictures by the first mail. The children are all away, but after some hesitation I concluded to take all the originals taken some years ago, including my own, box them up, and send them on board the steamer Fisher is fitting out. Webster took them to Boston this morning. The vessel was expected to go yesterday, and I had given letters to Read on Sunday that were to go by her. She could not be ready until today (Tuesday), and tonight Webster brought back the box, for the vessel in starting burst her escape pipes, and she will not be able to
leave before Thursday. I shall put this letter into the mail, and have no idea when you will get it, or the others; one in the box with the pictures and another in charge of the Captain. If I lose the pictures it will be a great pity. How sad it is that you do not get my letters. Yours come regularly, and you know what ship you send them by. Ours are put in the mail, and we do not know when they will reach you. If they get on board the ""Rhode Island"" or ""Connecticut"" they are three weeks or more on the way. Oh, dear, this is a poor way of communication! But we must be patient. I will write oftener still, and trust you may get them more frequently. We are having another battle now, Banks has the worst of it again. Capt. Abbott was reported killed, now wounded and missing. The family of course, in great trouble. What is to become of us with these defeats? The country here is in a terrible state of gloom. The people are disheartened. We are a little relieved to hear the ""Arkansas"" is destroyed, and that the fleet have gathered about New Orleans. How slowly these days go by! You do not write in your letters as if you expected me to return to you. Well, time will bring us together somewhere if one can but be content to let things take their course. When you have read my letters I wish you would send them back with yours, then I shall know you have received them, that they are not lost or in somebody's possession who ought not to have them. The children return tomorrow, unless they find it very pleasant. I am writing this hurriedly, as I want it to go out in the morning. The others are delayed, and I want to get something started. Do you spend your time at the Custom House, or at the house you live in? I wonder if you would be glad to have me there again. You write that you love and miss me very much. I shall beheve this, because it would hurt me so to think differently, and because you really do, you really do, beyond the strength of words.
Ever affectionately, Sarah

My dear Sarah: I am afraid you have been troubled by many reports, but be assured we are all right here. We have
had a terrible struggle at Baton Rouge and a glorious victory. I think that assures our safety, because the fools were really thinking of an attack on New Orleans. Let them come on. My health is as usual when you were here -- good one day, bad the next. We have had no case of the fever here yet. Our troops here are healthy, but they suffered terribly at Vicksburg. I will not write more details -- you will see all in the papers.
I wish I were with you now, if I could return, as I must not be away if there is to be trouble, even to be with you.
Kiss the children. Love me as well as you can. Be of good heart. Get strong and well.

"August 11, 1862","Boston, August 11th, 1862
General B. F. Butler
My dear Sir: I should feel that it was an unauthorized liberty to intrude on your time and attention with a matter of an exclusively private character, as I am well aware that matters of public duty must occupy all your energies and in reference to the latter, therefore I feel justified in calling your attention to a matter combining public with private interest,
I observe by the papers, and have learned from other sources, that Moses Greenwood has occupied a rather conspicuous position since you had control of New Orleans, and has seemed to enjoy your confidence as a good Union man. I hope most sincerely that he is in heart what he professes to be, but ""consistency is a jewel,"" and I am not disposed to have him enjoy the confidence of Union men without consistent action.
Early in the Spring of 1861, S. S. Kimball of Dardanelle, Ark., sent cotton worth a large sum to Moses Greenwood, with directions to sell and remit to Boston some $11,000 (say eleven thousand dollars) to pay amount due here from him, Kimball, advising parties here to whom he was indebted that he has done so; not hearing from Greenwood, parties here wrote to him making inquiries. He replied that Kimball had sent him Cotton for this purpose, that he had shipped it to England in a British vessel to keep it away from old Abe's pirates, and had ordered the proceeds returned in gold, -- if the difficulties were over when it came, he should remit as directed by K., otherwise he should do as he saw fit with the proceeds. This is substantially the tenor of his communication. I may not quote his exact words.
Immediately after your brilliant occupation of New Orleans, Greenwood was written to, calling his attention to the matter, requesting an adjustment of the affair. No reply can be had and no explanation is given. The inference is, that he is resolved to hold on to the funds belonging to Union men here, who are making sacrifices by giving themselves and their money to put down this infamous rebellion, and by so doing he is aiding to the extent of his ability in sustaining this stupendous wickedness.
My desire is that he should be called to account, if my statement is true that he should be compelled to disgorge the amount with interest. I understood the original value of the cotton was about $50,000, but $11,000 was all that was to be remitted here.
I have known Moses Greenwood for more than thirty years, and until this transaction always considered him a man of honor and integrity, and actuated by sincere religious principle. I cannot but hope that he may be ready to do justly without constraint, and be able to explain his conduct satisfactorily.
Very respectfully, Your Obdt. Servant,

Dear Sir: If you will put your claim in definite shape, Greenwood shall pay it. He is a secessionist still, and I have only dealt with him as such, and shall be delighted to deal with him again.

General B. F. Butler
General: I find in the New Orleans Picayune of the 9th inst. a Copy of your Genl. Orders No. 57 and in it the following clause.
""To complete the victory, the iron clad Steamer ‘Arkansas,’ the last naval hope of the rebellion, hardly awaited the gallant attack of the ‘Essex,’ but followed the example of her sisters, the ‘Merrimac’ the ‘Manassas,’ the ‘Mississippi,’ and the ‘Louisiana,’ by her own destruction.""
The facts Sir, are as follows: On the 6th inst. A. M. I steamed up the river to attack the ""Arkansas,"" and on our turning the point of the Bend, four miles above Baton Rouge, she immediately opened fire on this Ship, at about the distance of one
mile. I stood on until I considered myself near enough for my shot to penetrate her iron-clad sides, when I replied to her fire. We continued the action for nearly half an hour, when a shell from this ship penetrated her side and set her on fire. Your statement in your General Order No. 57 is therefore incorrect.
I wrote you previously to the attack on Baton Rouge, suggesting reinforcements, and in your reply you state, ""In my (your) judgment Baton Rouge will not be attacked."" You also state to Flag Officer Farragut ""that no dependence could be placed on the ‘Essex.’"" The letter is in my possession.
I have therefore to request that you will at once correct the above clause in your order No. 57, or I shall certainly believe you have intentionally and maliciously attempted to vilify my character.
I beg to state another fact. It was entirely owing to the presence of the ""Essex"" and ""Sumpter,"" both under my command, that your army at Baton Rouge was saved from defeat, for I now have convincing information that Genl. Breckinridge had a force in connection with the Ram ""Arkansas"" to accomplish this object.
It is well-known to all who know anything of the attack on Baton Rouge that the left wing of our force gave way -- that the Rebels advanced, and at one time had part possession of the Penitentiary, at the head of the town, until the fire from the ""Essex,"" over our own men, drove them from that building and forced them beyond their original lines.
Very respectfully Your obedt. Servant
W. D. Porter, Comd'g Division of Flotilla on Western Water
P. S. The ""Essex"" was the only vessel present at the action, and on the ""Arkansas"" starboard side I counted fourteen shot holes through her new plating, put on at Vicksburg. You, Sir, were one hundred and fifty miles off, and could know nothing of it. I was within 300 yds. of her, and was on deck and traced every shot to her. It is not reasonable to suppose that so brave an Officer as her Commander, H. K. Stephens, formerly of the U. S. Navy, would burn his vessel merely on the ""Essex"" heaving in sight, when he knew his vessel was of superior force in plating, speed, Guns, and Crew, and when he had on a former occasion encountered her; when he also knew that to set fire to his vessel would be to forfeit his life to the so-called Government of the Confederate States, and I
have the fact in my possession that he had coaled up a mile above the position of attack, and that it was his intention to attack the Gun Boats at Baton Rouge that evening at 6 o'clock. -- W. D. P."

Captain Ransom writes that he learned through you, that Captain W. D. Porter of the ""Essex"" said that during the fight between the ""Essex"" and the Ram ""Arkansas"" ""we ran away.""
Not wishing you to retain a wrong impression of Captain Fairfax, I have taken the liberty to address you a few lines.
In the first place, there was no fight between the ""Essex"" and the ""Ram,"" only a few shots exchanged at the distance of a mile and a half apart, when the ""Ram"" was set on fire by her officers, and burnt up. During the exchange of these shots, we were in supporting distance of the ""Essex,"" and ready to engage at the first opportunity, and remained so until ordered down the river by Captain Porter.
The character of these two men is too well-known in the Navy for Captain Fairfax to be injured by anything that Captain Porter says of him, and the report you have heard I hope you will not believe, as it is false. Believe me to be,
Yours sincerely, E. H. Perkins"

Dear Sir: Captain Ransom has recently informed me of Commo. Porter's extraordinary conduct in assailing me in my absence, and that among entire strangers. He asserts that ""I did run away"" and leave the ""Essex"" to fight the Ram ""Arkansas"" alone.
Captain Ransom has done me no more than justice in pronouncing this report of Wm. D. Porter's ""an infamous falsehood."" It can be shown that the ""Essex"" did not engage the
Ram ""Arkansas"" at all -- unless laying beyond the range of either vessels' guns, and occasionally firing a shot, can be so designated!
The ""Arkansas"" was destroyed by her own crew, and abandoned before our little fleet then on duty at Baton Rouge, -- it was the presence of the ""Essex,"" more than a match for ""Arkansas,"" and our Gun Boats, and the crippled condition of ""Ram"" that induced Capt. Stevens to destroy her. Commander Porter failed to bring his vessel into action as he assured me he would, at the same time asserting that he ""knew the ‘Arkansas,’ and that the ‘Essex’ could readily whip her."" Lt. Perkins had my orders what to do in the event of an attack -- to keep within supporting distance of ""Essex."" My plan was to pass up stream and engage Ram at her vulnerable point -- her stern -- while ""Essex,"" fighting upstream, kept her in position favorable to my plan.
It is scarcely worth your time to read a statement of the whole matter, as I have sent one to Capt Ransom and requested him to give you all the particulars. You know Lt. Perkins -- he has the reputation of being brave and truthful, in my opinion they are necessary to each other. Do you think it likely that I would run from a fight with such a man at my side? General Butler, I hold such relations to this rebellion that I would die a thousand times rather than give my Southern acquaintances an opportunity to say that the only coward of a brave people deserted his State and hearth-side to fight on the stronger side. But I will not longer detain you, -- you will greatly oblige me by showing this to those of your officers who were present when Commodore Porter forgot himself, and assailed one of his profession behind his back -- at the same time seeming to be friendly when last we met. Had Porter not assailed me I should never have spoken of the Ram -- leaving it to his own conscience entirely whether he destroyed her -- or her own officers and crew. As it is, I shall have all possible light thrown upon the whole matter. If you will give Ransom anything to show officially what Porter asserted about me, you will confer a great favor.

At this rate I can put on two hundred and fifty more men, and not increase the demand on the fund from which the pay for this labor is taken.

The Officer states ""that in all cases where shipments of private property have been made on vessels chartered to the United States bound to this port (New York) for a consideration to be paid by its owner, the Government has been greatly the loser, as the time employed by the vessel in finding a berth and discharging her Cargo cost the Government a great deal more than the freight amounts to.""

I have the honor to report that I received from Qr. Mst. Genl. a copy of this letter, and replied to it that hereafter I would send no freight north on Government Transports. But at the same time I must be allowed to insist that Col. D. D. Tompkins' argument (that it costs more to discharge vessels than freight amounts to) was, to say the least, a poor recommendation in favor of Col. Tompkins' capacity to discharge that kind of business.

My dear dear wife: So you see what a constant correspondent I am. I will not say an interesting one, but I have a writing desk in my room, and when I get up and have no thought to trouble me, then I love the writing to you. It is the next thing to seeing you.
I am a little bit out of health -- I confess to so much lest if I should write I am well all the time you would say that I am not giving you the exact state of my health. Caroline has heard of her mother's death, and thinks she must go home.
Poor girl -- I must lose my housekeeper. She has done very well, but is not afficted with neatness. I shall have to get another. What say you to a young, dashing, black-eyed brunette, with a strong tongue and sharp nose, that will make us all stand around? Do you know of one you can recommend?
Our casualties in that battle are very large. I spent yes terday and Sunday inspecting the hospitals. We have some 90 killed and two hundred and fifty wounded. One regiment lost every field officer. We are now seeing the strong realities of war. It is wonderful to see how the poor fellows bore up -- only anxious to get well to try it again.
Do you think that Breckinridge will try it again? I trust not, for the sake of those who must fall, but he is welcome so far as carrying our lines are concerned. We have danger here of an negro insurrection. I hardly know whether to wish it or fear it most. I shall arm the ""free Blacks,"" I think, for I must have more troops, and I see no way of getting them save by arming the black brigade that the rebels had. I send you Rear Admiral Farragut's picture. When shall I get yours and the children's? I send a large gun and some swords as trophies, also a bell for the table -- one of the bells given for cannon. A box of wine is coming, the gift of my friend Mr. Durant, very old and searce, the vine is dead.
The summer is wearing away. In a month, if I can get force enough, I shall be at Mobile, doing the rest of my work. God bless and keep you, dearest wife and best friend.

Dear General: I thank you kindly for your salute, and hope that I may be able to return it at some no distant day with interest.

Dear General: We are again in the midst of excitement. I saw a very intelligent man just from the enemies' lines, who says that Jeff Thompson is on the way to join Breckinridge, with 500 men and several siege guns. He thinks they must be here in 36 to 48 hours at the furthest. Also that Van Dorn, Ruggles and others, at the head of 15,000 to 20,000 men, are moving on New Orleans, all having left Vicksburg but a mere garrison. Also, that Moore is on the opposite Bank with several hundred troops, with some small field pieces, to annoy the gun post in case of attack. The same information is given by a variety of sources, and I do not hesitate to express my belief of it. This place has been nearly completely sacked by the soldiery. Scarcely a single house has escaped, all the citizens having fled. We are getting quite strong ""breastworks,"" but Demoralization weakens more than dirt strengthens us, and it seems officers are indifferent or powerless to stop it. Even officers' tents are filled with furniture from deserted houses. I am no alarmist, but I am terribly exercised by our present condition.

Sir: There is one fact that I desire to set right in letter of July 15th, which has just come to hand.
The assault on Fort St. Philip, as soon as the vessels had
passed it so that the Quarantime Station could be occupied, was determined upon months before the landing was made, i. e. on the 23rd of February. Lieut. Weitzel, of the Engineers, who finished the Fort, was with me for that purpose; scaling ladders were prepared -- boats procured -- and the scheme fully matured, and the ground found practicable from actual experiment.
Please, Captain, do not judge of our profession, yours will furnish you with sufficient scope.
I have directed measures to be taken to guard against the very assault we intend to make upon Fort St. Philip.

Count Mejan, French Consul
Sir: Your official note to Lieut. Weitzel, assistant Military Commandant, has been forwarded to me.
I see no just cause of complaint against the order requiring the arms of private Citizens to be delivered up. It is the usual course pursued in cities similarly situated to this, even without any exterior force in the neighborhood.
You will observe that it will not do to trust to mere professions of Neutrality. I trust most of your countrymen are in a good faith neutral, but it is unfortunately true that some of the men are not. This causes the good, of necessity, to suffer for the acts of the bad.
I take leave to call your attention to the fact that the United States forces gave every immunity to Mons. Bonnegass, who claimed to be French Consul at Baton Rouge, allowed him to keep his arms, and relied upon his neutrality, but his son was taken prisoner on the battlefield in arms against us.
You will also do me the favor to remember that very few of the French subjects here have taken the oath of neutrality, which was offered to but not required of them by my Order No. 41, although all the officers of the French legion had with your knowledge and assent taken the oath to support the constitution of the Confederate States. Thus you see I have no guarantee for the good faith of bad men.
I do not understand how it is that arms are altered in their effectiveness by being ""personal property,"" nor do I see how
arms which will serve for personal defense (""qui ne puivent servir que pour leur defense personelle"") cannot be as effectively used for offensive warfare.
Of the disquiet which you say there are signs manifesting themselves among the black population, of a desire to break their bonds which bind them to their masters (""certaine dispositions a rompée les liens qui les attachment a leurs maitres""), I have been a not inattentive observer, without wonder, because it would seem natural, when their masters had set them the example of rebellion against constituted authorities, that the negroes, being an imitative race, should do likewise.
But surely the representative of the Emperor, who does not tolerate slavery in France, does not desire his countrymen to be armed for the purpose of preventing the negroes from breaking their bonds.
Let me assure you that the protection of the United States against violence, either by negroes or white men, whether citizens or foreign, will continue to be as perfect as it has been since our advent here, and by far more manifesting itself at all moments and everywhere (""tous les instants et partout"") than any improvised citizen organization can do.
Whenever the inhabitants of this City will, by a public and united act, show both their loyalty and neutrality, I shall be glad of their aid to keep the peace, and indeed to restore the city to them. Till that time, however, I must require the arms of all the inhabitants, white and black, to be under my control. I have the honor to be

Dr. Mercer has, as we learn, explained to you with some fullness the nature of these fevers, in the excited state of a large portion of the people in the city; and we are gratified to hear that you expressed a willingness to alleviate this apprehension and obviate this danger as far as consistent with your object of securing your forces from any attempt at violence from within.

Sir: Since the attack on Baton Rouge, of which I sent you the general description in my last, I have directed that place to be slightly intrenched and put in condition of defence. My judgment has been to hold the point, not for any special military but for political importance. If pressed here, however, I must evacuate it, but shall destroy it before I leave it.
We are now threatened by the whole western division of the southern army under Generals Van Dorn, Breckinridge, and Jeff Thompson, together with whatever troops can be gotten from Texas or on the western bank of the river. The withdrawal of the troops at Vicksburg, and the apparent inactivity or withdrawal of troops from Corinth, has allowed the concentration of all their troops upon me. Vicksburg is essentially bare of troops. We are considerably weakened by disease and discharges of those whom months' service have shown unfit for such. I have largely caused the regiments to be filled up by enlistments here, and I doubt not in all I have
enlisted a thousand men in the old regiments, and I have now 1200 being organized as the first regiments of Louisiana Volunteer National Guards, and two companies of cavalry. I think I shall get two regiments beside, but that is work of time.
I need reinforcements very much; without them I cannot co-operate with the navy against Mobile.
Indeed we are threatened with an attack on the City of New Orleans. I am not specially disturbed at that. If it becomes at all imminent, I shall call on Africa to intervene, and I do not think I shall call in vain. I have determined to use the services of the free colored men who were organized by the rebels into the ""Colored Brigade,"" of which we have heard so much. They are free, they have been used by our enemies, whose mouths are shut, and they will be loyal.
I would like an experienced Brigadier General in place of the lamented Williams, and would again press the appointment of Lt. Weitzel of the Engineers.
If I am to have any troops I would prefer New England Soldiers, not that they are any better than others, but that I know them better. I would not ask more than 5000 of the Massachusetts and Connecticut Quota.
I have need of more cavalry in order to hunt out the guerillas, a regiment with what I have would do immense service.
May I ask prompt action in regard to the reënforcements. More than four months since my ordnance officer made requisition for some ammunition, 54-100 Calibre, and it has not yet come. Our 54 rifles are useless. The invoices have come but no cartridges.

Sir: I have this moment received the letter with which you have honored me.
I am not aware that I have imposed any different quarantine upon Spanish Vessels, sailing from Havana, from any other nations. My orders are imperative the Quarantine officers not to allow any vessel from an infected port to pass without strictest quarantine. Those orders have been obeyed. In one instance, when a vessel did not touch the shore at Havana, I believe they were relaxed.
I beg to assure you, and the Government of her most Catholic Majesty, that personally and officially I entertain, as I have always entertained, feelings of the utmost cordiality toward that Government, and any vessel coming from Spain or any portion of her Majesty's dominions, not infected with ""Epidemic Yellow Fever,"" which is the bill of health of the ""Pinta,"" will be allowed to pass as the most favored nation. It is only a desire to save the inhabitants of New Orleans, as well Spanish as others, from that deadly scourge, the Epidemic, that makes me rigid in quarantine.

Colonel: Upon the most mature consideration, in view of of the evident preparations to attack the City of New Orleans, which requires a concentration of our forces, I am constrained to come to the conclusion that it is necessary to evacuate Baton Rouge.
We have demonstrated our ability to hold the place, but it is now a question of utility. You will therefore begin the movement quietly and rapidly, get everything off except your men, and then see to it that the town is destroyed.
After mature deliberation, I deem this a military necessity of the highest order, much more than the burning of Hampton by Magruder. That town was burned by its own friends in August, to prevent its shelter to our troops. The shelter of Baton Rouge to them is a necessity in the long winter campaign, to say nothing of the advantage as a summer residence.
In regard to the poor prisoners, they will be between two fires. Use in regard to them your best judgment.
I do not know that I can aid you further by any observations. I am,

Sir: This will be handed you by Joseph M. Bell, Esq., late law partner and son-in-law of our friend the lamented Rufus Choate. Mr. Bell has been serving with me since November last as Volunteer Aid de Camp and Military Secretary, more recently as Provost Judge of the City of New Orleans, wherein he has won golden opinions from all right-minded persons.
Major Bell goes North for a movement of recruitment, as he has good cause to do, and I am pleased to be able through him to communicate so directly with the War Department.
I have but little doubt that I shall be attacked here within the next 20 days or thereabouts. As I predicted some months ago, in my despatch to the War Department, I am in danger from the débris of Beauregard's army at Shiloh. Some 19 or 20 Regiments and several Batteries from it are gathering upon us. I have ordered the evacuation and destruction of Baton Rouge, which will be effected unless an attack is made upon it by Van Dorn before we shall get away. In that ease we shall fight. The pendency of a contest there is imminent. It seems to be the tactics of the enemy to attempt to drive us out of New Orleans at all hazards. They agree the town will be destroyed in so doing, but they reason that there is so large a foreign interest here, that the destruction of the town will embroil us with foreign powers.
Whether that be so or not, I do not propose to be driven out, or if I am driven out, there will be no New Orleans. This is clearly a necessity. If we had five Regiments, or 5000 men more in our old Regiments, there would be no attack.
Major Bell, however, understands the whole subject of our difficulties here thoroughly, and will give you the fullest information upon those you may desire.

This crime being an overt act of rebellion against the authority of the United States, whether by a citizen or an alien, works a forfeiture of the property of the offender, and, therefore, every slave giving information that shall discover the concealed arms of his or her master, shall be held to be emancipated.

Dearest: Your letters of July 30th and Aug. 2nd came on Thursday, Aug. 13th. I write the date, that you may know how long it takes for them to reach here. I wish you would mention when you get my letters, and the dates. I could not tell how many I have written, if they should fall into other hands I should never know you had not received them. Certainly they would read strangely to others. I wish you would return them when read, that I may be sure they reach you. Your pictures came enclosed. You ask me if I do not think the position easy? I do, and like the picture very much. I sat for one the day previous. In the contrast of these two faces, the difference of expression is the history of life that is never written. I have sent you by the steamer Fisher sends out pictures (taken in better times) of myself, Blanche, Paul, and Benny. Paint from these, I can get none better of the children, and for me, I am too weary. I shall sink below the centre, before rest and peace will find and fold me. This is one of the times when hope comes not, and the eye-lids are heavy with unshed tears. It would be better if I should not write now but feeling badly we are apt to grope about for sympathy, even if sure we cannot find it. ""Every one can master a grief but he that hath it."" ""And if he cannot master, let him hide it"" saith the world, and wisely is that said too. I must lie down and rest. When I begin again it will be in a pleasanter vein.
Ah me! resting does not refresh me, I must write on as I have begun, or not write at all. If we were together, you might aid me a little by some kindly words, if it were not too much trouble to speak them. How well I understand what Father felt, when he said, ""I have such a weight of weariness, the bed cannot bear me up; I shall sink through it and then sink lower yet."" How far away this looks to you with health, hope, and ambition, all your own, satisfied, as your picture shows you, yet eager to win more yet. Long may you wear that look, and you will, too; hope with you is triumphant, if it were darkened or killed, you could easier die than bear the difference. The children have returned from the Beach, with burned faces, noisy and happy. Week after next Blanche goes back again. Goodnight, it is late, they are all asleep but me. And you -- I wonder if you are sleeping too! I should like
to look in, but I feel too timid to take the liberty. Too poor -- for aught, but ""God be merciful to me a sinner!""
Today we have been to Capt. Abbott's funeral. I wound a wreath of geranium leaves, and a bouquet of flowers. He was buried in Lowell by request of the Authorities of the Town and at the city's expense. The military's four companies followed in procession -- the funeral was very large. Being Sunday, Merrimack and Central streets were full of people. The ""Saxon"" came in last Friday. Whitney went to New York. The vessel with the pictures has not yet left Boston. I hear she will leave tomorrow or Tuesday. This letter I shall send by New York. How poor and unsatisfactory it will read to you. Still the same despondency, you say! Even so; it is killing or driving me to madness, much depended on you. If I could have had the summer, with only the anxiety that I expect to endure, fears for your health, parting with children, I think I could bear it, and while so constantly assured of your health, even have grown stronger, and gained some cheerfulness. After I left, the change you made shook me with disquiet. It was some time before I heard of it, then an age before a letter can reach you, and even then, I feel no assurances you will heed me; the pressure is too heavy for me! You say my views of life are utopian. To you they seem so. Perhaps they would to others, yet they are true and honorable, I shall never be able to change them. If I could force my thoughts to rest here, and shut out all but care of the children, there would be hope in it. Alas, I cannot do it! You will reproach me for feeling and writing so, and I reproach myself; but I am too unhappy to be angry with. If you can say anything to comfort me it is better to do that.

On Saturday night, at 10 o'clock, I send a party consisting of forty men, under Lieut. Brainard, in the Steamer ""Labarge,"" to meet him and his Lieut., of whom I also had information. My orders were to seize all arms of every sort, and if full proof were found upon the spot
against Lasart, the Lieut. was at liberty to take any of his property, useful as necessary to the troops. Lasart is a trader.
Several shot guns were found there, a Confederate Flag, a full uniform and side-arms, and Lasart confessed that he was engaged in raising a Company, having already seventeen men enrolled.
The party arrested several persons who were paroled, but the Capt. and his Lieut. are now in Fort Jackson.
Two mules, a cart, and harness were brought away, also two Milch Cows with their calves, some cases of wine for the hospital, some stout shoes, a fishing net and lines. Nothing was taken from the house. The mules, cows, and fishing-gear were needed here.
The seizures of the Capt. and Lieut. will effectually check all recruiting in that quarter.

I have not done anything about appropriating any for use at the Forts, lest it might not comport with your views, I would like instructions.

"August 18, 1862","Lowell, Aug. 18th, 1862,
Dearest: The news came this morning that the rebels have attacked Baton Rouge and been repulsed, that Gen. Williams had his head blown off by a cannon ball. Who is to take his place? Ah me, who have you left but Phelps, and he so unmanageable. New Orleans, if you can keep the fleet, is invincible; why do they go to Pensacola? I sent you a letter this morning, would I could recall it, written from depression I could not overcome. If it adds to your perplexities I shall never forgive myself. Why did I not stay with you? It would have been better for both of us. If we live to meet again we will remain together. May there not be some mistake about Gen. Williams? I believe he has a wife and children, what heart-aches all over the country! His death I must weep for a truly noble gentleman, always kind and courteous. What will you do without him? An experienced officer is wanted at Baton Rouge if you still hold it, and you have so few. Is it not wrong you should be left there with so small a force. But yet you can hold it, New Orleans I mean, against the whole south if they have not ironclad vessels to destroy the fleet. And hold it you will, you are more able when pressed with danger and with few resources. Use every precaution, and treat Phelps kindly as possible. Oh, how much I wish I was with you! Dearest, I can go anywhere with you, I am not afraid of danger, but I cannot sit down apart and think; it unfits me for anything. I hope you will not get this morning's letter until you receive this. I would not add a feather's weight by telling you I am troubled. The death of Gen. Williams has nerved me like steel. Would I were a man. I am stronger in the hour of danger, for then I forget myself and woman's cares, and feel all the high enthusiasm that leads to deeds of fame, and for this reason it is better I should be with you. I could never pull you back from what I thought it your duty to do, but should urge you forward, and help, with all the wit I have. I shall look for any news now. If you are firm as you will be, careful and far-seeing, the rebels cannot reach you. Kiss me, dearest, and believe, me your
Affectionate Wife
P. S. Weitzel is wise and experienced, you will have every defence complete to the last degree. Fisher's vessel leaves today, but I send this by New York.
Fisher sends out a sailing vessel besides the steamer. The ""Saxon"" came in on the 15th. Your letter of Aug. 5th came this morning. Would it were possible for you to come home, but you cannot leave in the hour of danger. The rebels will soon make the attempt, if they make it at all, and then it will be quiet again. The fall will come, and you will return or I shall go to you, though, believe me, I do not flatter myself that the last will be the same to you as coming home. But it will be better than nothing, do not you think so? Say yes, and look for me soon. I thought to have written one page, and I have run all over the paper. Once more, kiss me and believe me

Dearest: We have further news this afternoon of the battle at Baton Rouge. The vessel has arrived with the body of Gen. Williams. The papers are out in large letters, stating the particulars. It was really a gallant fight, and bravely Gen. Williams led them on to battle. Three horses shot under him, before he lost his own brave life. Oh! the pity that he was killed! The loss of such a man is woeful. There are so few that are so capable, and we are pressed at every point. I am greatly relieved that the ""Arkansas"" is destroyed; there is no chance of the rebels taking New Orleans without iron-clad vessels, yet do not omit your vigilance for a moment. If they wrest it from you, you and the country lose everything. Do you think I could have borne the climate through the summer? I do not know, I was so thin it seemed there would be nothing left of me. I sent you a letter this morning, another this afternoon, and yet this evening I am writing again. I have been so unhappy the last week, painfully so, but I will not write again when I feel so badly. These ships that have come in will bring me more letters tomorrow. It is the only pleasure I get. You are kind enough to write often. I would gladly repay you in kind, but fear I may not always be able to do it. Haggerty must be with you nearly a week. The ""Ocean Queen"" was spoken with by one of these vessels that came today at the mouth of the Mississippi, so that she arrived directly after these left. Good night, dearest, I shall not finish this till I get one from you tomorrow.
Dearest, your letter came this morning as I expected. I am so glad not to be disappointed. Your Order No. 54 is capital. The only thing to lament is the great loss of Gen. Williams and those who fell with him. Do not feel too secure that they will not make another attack. I hope things will not come to extremities between you and Gen. Phelps; I thoroughly like and respect him. The Government I trust will decide it. It is evident your health is not reliable from what you write -- not as good as I had hoped. I wish it were possible you could come home if only for a short time, but I dare not ask it. We have entered upon this sea of troubles and must meet its perils. Thank Heaven, the summer is almost over, and thus far you have escaped the fever. It is thought to be too late for it now, but enforce the quarantine until the first frost. That has been your safety thus far. I have not yet heard if Kinsman went out with Capt. Haggerty but believe he did. On Thursday I shall go to Boston and try once more for a picture. I think, after all, my picture had better be painted with the figure, the dress can be plain not striped. The vessel did not start till yesterday. The pictures and letters have been on board a week. Do not leave my letters where others can read them -- enclose and send them back with your own. Fisher has been telegraphed by Whitney to go on to New York and take his papers with him this morning. But he has no papers. I suppose they will manage some way. Wanting to see you so much, I am

You will leave it as whole as you can, unless you are obliged to burn it as a matter of defensive action. I have not changed my opinion of the great military advantage it will be to the enemy to have it, but I am impelled by a sense of just humanity to overlook this advantage.

justify that destruction upon the unoffending. With New Orleans it would be different, which must be held at all hazards or destroyed. It is the key to the River, and the Arsenal and Banking House of the rebellion. I have the honor to be,

"August 19, 1862","Head Qrs. Department of the Gulf, New Orleans, Aug. 19, 1862
Sir: In making you the proposition in my former note, I by no means intended to enter into a correspondence which would add to my official labors. You have ""grasped"" the opportunity to bring to my notice several matters, wherein you complain of my action toward the Spanish residents and merchants. I cannot take time to reply to these at length, but the respect due to your official character demands that I should at least set you right in regard to some of them. In respect to the Spanish merchant who is consul here, I was informed that he refused to give a bill of health to the American vessel, the ""Roanoke,"" when this city was wholly free from epidemic, and said that he did this because I refused to allow the ""Cardenas"" to come up. I sent for him, and told him that if he did not give precisely the same bill of health to the ""Roanoke"" as he would have done and was required to do by the laws, irrespective of ""Cardenas,"" I would send him to the Captain General at Cuba.
To this he replied that he should be glad to go -- but that the Captain General would send me no more vessels. To that I replied that he would give my compliments to Captain
General, and say that he could do me no so great a favor as to send me no more vessels of any sort (Spanish or others) from Cuba until the sickly season was over. And I submit to yourself, Captain, as a man of honor, if in either case I was wrong, acting upon the information I had received.
Upon the seizure of the house of Puig Brothers, the Spanish Consul addressed me a note in substance saying that he desired to know the cause of the seizure. To that I answered in substance that if he would bring Mr. Puig with him to me, I would be glad to explain the cause of the seizure of his house. To that the Consul replied that such was not his custom.
After the arrest and punishment of a criminal official by me, a clerk of Puig made a reclamation of such character that I have put it under investigation, and I hope to show its falsity and be able to punish the claimant. While this matter is being investigated I have not answered the communication enclosing it. I am not aware of any other letter of the Spanish Consul that seemed to require an answer that has not been replied to. If there is, it is to be attributed to the press of official correspondence and business which has caused it to be overlooked.
As regards the correspondence of the Consul, I can assure you that no letter of his, coming through the regular channels of communication, has been examined, although I reserve to myself the right so to do as the commander of a Military post. I found a large bundle of letters on board a vessel running the blockade directed to the Spanish Consul; these were opened. Again I found a large bundle of letters of the same direction on the person of one whom I have arrested, a spy, being a member of a large mercantile house who had smuggled himself between here and the enemy's lines at Mobile in the disguise of a bar keeper. Finding letters directed to the Spanish Consul in the hands of this spy, I caused them to be examined, as I did letters thus surreptitiously conveyed here directed to the French Consul.
If the Representative of Her Most Catholic Majesty will have his letters come to him through the hands of spies and smugglers when our mails are all freely open to him, I shall be obliged to examine them
In regard to the Quarantine imposed upon the ""Cardenas"" and other Spanish vessels, my orders are imperative and distinct to my health officers to subject all vessels coming from infected ports to such a quarantine as shall insure safety from
disease. You yourself will bear witness with what success this quarantine has been carried out as regards the health of the city.
Whether one day or one hundred is necessary for this purpose, it will be done. It will be done if it is necessary to take the vessel to pieces to do it, so long as the United States has the physical power (pouvoir material) to enforce it. I have submitted to the judgment of my very competent surgeon at the Quarantine the question of the length of time and the acts proper to be taken to insure safety. I have by no order interfered with his discretion. If he thinks ten days sufficient in a given case, be it so, if forty in another, be it so, if one hundred in another, it shall be so.
I should think, however, that the Surgeon would make a difference in length of quarantine between a vessel which only touched at Havana and one that loaded and shipped her crew there. This may account for the different length of quarantine. Some of the vessels you name came earlier in the season. But with this I have nothing to do except to enforce rigorously such quarantine as my health officers think proper.
In regard to the petty officer and men of your ship, I had not been informed save by your letter.
If you had done me the honor to notify me of their arrestation, I would instantly have seen to it that they should have had every advantage upon their trial. Convince me now that injustice has been done and they shall be pardoned. You will remember that I cannot personally superintend every administrative and judicial act. If you have listened to the unreasonable complaints of bad men so as not to feel at liberty to approach me with the freedom and promptness which has characterised the intercourse of the Commanders of the French ship ""Milan"" and the British ship, ""Rinaldo,"" -- whenever their country men needed redress, I am sure you will acquit me of all blame so far as official and personal courtesy toward yourself is concerned.
I have to apologise for the delay in this reply. My translater was absent, and I do not read your language with sufficient accuracy to allow myself to reply to the language of accusation without a translation. With sentiments of respect, I have the honor to be,

Sir: I have commissioned Mr. Gill to purchase some provisions for the female orphan asylum of Donaldsonville, as they are badly off on account of the troubles which have lately occurred in that unfortunate little town. To my great pain and astonishment the asylum, under the care of the sisters of
Charity, was bombarded, and I only attribute our safety to the miraculous intervention of Divine Providence. This bombardment has caused us to lose much, for although I remained with my sisters and orphans during the bombardment and the fire which was set, yet I had to leave the place for some time, as the asylum and Church were threatened with entire destruction, should the guerillas fire again on the U. S. transports. The guerillas having continued to fire, I had to seek an asylum at the Sacred Heart Convent until we are either burned or out of danger. Our house is a poor institution without income, as we are there for the poor, destitute children of the village and the orphans. I feel much grieved to think that when our sisters have been nursing the Federal Soldiers since the beginning of the war, and one hundred more who cheerfully started at the first call to nurse your sick and wounded at Fortress Monroe and other points, your commanding officers should come and bombard my family and innocent orphans, especially when our house was out of the operation of Donaldsonville, though near. Do you think it just, General, that our sisters or any one of our society should be thus treated, when a part of the same society are rendering your soldiers all imaginable care of soul and body? Is it a just and grateful return for the services we render your sick at the risk of our lives?
I trust you are too much of a gentleman and too generous to approve such a conduct, and I rely on your kindness for my orphans, who are without Provisions, and who lost much in the moving I had to undergo. It is in your power to indemnify them, and to give them provisions, and by sending some to them you will in some manner efface the stain attached to such an inhuman and atrocious deed as the one perpetrated against us. I am sure President Lincoln never intended the Sisters of Charity to be molested in this manner, and surely you do not approve either of such cowardly and base feats. In the name of God I entreat you to take into consideration all our sufferings through your soldiers and officers, and extend to the poor orphans a helping hand. By so doing you will be entitled to our lasting gratitude, and to our prayers for your welfare.

Madame: I had no information until the reception of your note that so sad a result to the sisters of your command had happened from the bombardment of Donaldsonville.
I am very, very sorry that Rear Admiral Farragut was unaware that he was injuring your establishment by his shells. Any injury must have been entirely accidental. The destruction of that town became a necessity. The inhabitants harbored a gang of cowardly Guerillas, who committed every atrocity, amongst others that of firing upon an unarmed boat crowded with women and children going up the coast, returning to their homes, many of them having been at school at New Orleans.
It is impossible to allow such acts, and I am only sorry that the righteous punishment meted out to them in this instance, as indeed in all others, fell quite as heavily upon the innocent and unoffending as upon the guilty.
No one can appreciate more fully than myself the holy, self-sacrificing labors of the sisters of Charity. To them our soldiers are daily indebted for the kindest offices. Sisters of all mankind, they know no nation, no kindred, neither war nor peace. Their all-pervading Charity is like the boundless love of ""Him who died for all,"" whose servants they are, and whose pure teachings their love illustrates.
I repeat my grief that any harm should have befallen your society of sisters, and I cheerfully repair it as I may in the manner you suggest, by filling the order you have sent to the City for provisions and medicines.
Your sisters in the city will also further testify to you that my officers and soldiers have never failed to do for them all in our power to aid them in their usefulness, and to lighten the burden of their labors. With sentiments of the highest respect, Believe me,

"August 20, 1862","New Orleans, Aug. 20th, 1862 Dear Sir: I regret to have to trouble you with my correspondence, but out of feelings for my Brother I am compelled to do it. He is now near St. Martinsville, confined in a hog pen without a blanket, and almost without clothes, and covered with vermin. He has been sick for two weeks without any attention whatever, and he is now failing quite fast and cannot without some relief last longer. I cannot go to him, and under the circumstances I do not see how I can afford him any relief.
And now, my dear Sir, I would beg that you confine Capt. Deslonde until my brother is either released or paroled. He is an important character, as he is brother-in-law of Slidell and Beauregard, and has influence with the Rebel authorities. He can send a messenger by your consent and have my brother paroled, if nothing more, at any time.
Capt. Deslonde is now about the city and enjoying all the comforts of life, while my brother is suffering for something to sustain life, and has not even a blanket to cover him from the
night air. I do beg and pray that you would shut this man up at once, as it will have the desired effect. I thank you, General, for the kindness you have shown me, and hope that it may not be long before I can raise the glorious old Flag again over my home, and live in peace as of old.
I am happy to know that you are now dealing with these people as they deserve, for severity is the only thing that will ever bring them to their senses. I remain
Yours with much respect, Thomas S. Burbank

"August 25, 1862","Headquarters Dept. of the Gulf, New Orleans, Augst, 25th, 1862
To the Officer Commanding Forces at Opelousas
Sir: I have sent Mr. A. Deslonde to you, a well-known gentleman of this state, who has been captured and held by me under his parole, and as one of the hostages for the safety of Wm. Burbank and other peaceable Citizens of the United States who have been taken by your forces. He has been selected as a messenger because he has peculiar and personal interest in the question presented by him, and goes under his solemn parole to return in any event.
Mr. Deslonde bears a copy of a letter from the Brother of Mr. Burbank to me, disclosing a course of treatment toward a citizen of the State of Louisiana that I can hardly conceive to be true.
One purpose I have in sending this note is to ask you to certify to me officially what is the treatment accorded to Mr. Burbank, so that I may relieve the mind of the brother from what I shall believe, until officially informed to the contrary, must be an exaggeration, and I have also desired the official information so that I might be in condition to act understandingly upon this and like cases.
Mr. Deslonde is farther desired to confer with you whether it is not possible that some arrangement be entered into by which the citizens who are quietly at home may be unmolested.
Of course, this is a matter as regards numbers that may be attested of much more importance to the forces which you command than it can be to me. Yet it should seem to be desirable that some convention upon this subject might be had, which would relieve the war of its pressure upon the non-combatants on both sides.
Mr. Deslonde is informally possessed of my views upon this topic, and he may be able to so far convey to me the views of the authorities upon your behalf as to make a basis of more formal action. I have the honor to be,
Your Obdt. Servt.,

"August 25, 1862","Lowell, Aug. 25th, 1862, Monday Morn
Dearest: Your letter of the 12th of Aug. came this morning. I see you have not received my letters, or this matter of house-keepers would not be presented either for blondes or brunettes. But let that pass Gilman can look that the negroes do not destroy, there should be no other servants in your house. I speak now for your own honor, what might be supposed to affect me is of little moment. None can make me less than I hold myself, as expecting consideration, if I deserve more it will be estimated hereafter. Major Strong and family left this morning after a short visit. I was very glad to see them. He sails next Saturday for New Orleans, and would be pleased to have me go with him but does not like to urge it. On Friday I send Blanche back to school. So that I have but little time to be ready. And I do not know if you wish me to come. You write of returning home, but nothing of my going out, and I do not know if you think it advisable for me to be there. I cannot but think you would be well pleased to see me, but yet it might be better to wait until you have said so. That may be in the next letter. Major Strong looks very well, and is in excellent spirits, but I fear he is going a little too soon; he was so prostrated by the climate before. Mrs. Strong expects to go to New Orleans this Fall -- if you find his health failing, send him back if you have occasion to send despatches, and I will go back with them if you would like me to be there. Major Strong has received no promotion. He would like it, of course, as there are two or three now on your staff who rank him. He has shown himself able and courageous, and he likes you thoroughly. These reasons are good enough for me, if it were in my power to aid him. The ""Saxon"" came in on the fifteenth. Fisher was here but a little while last evening to see Major Strong. I saw him only a few minutes alone. He told me what Whitney said his Captain reported, but said there was nothing I need write to you. He said that he told
Whitney that he had better write if he was not satisfied, just as he would in any other business transaction. Whitney on reflection decided to let it be for the present. Perhaps I ought to say nothing, but it has been usual for me to write you everything I hear that relates to you. J -- n appeared as he usually does, blustering and overbearing, and as though he had made a poor thing of it to Capt. Pepper, when it was understood that he had received seventeen thousand or more. I cannot write this critically because I had not time to understand it, and the payment for the vessel is less than that paid by the government. You received Captain Pepper kindly and courteously, he said, and on his statement, ordered J -- n to make up his account. How far it is satisfactory to Whitney you can imagine. Government offered him four hundred and fifty a day to run her to Hilton Head as soon as she arrived. But he has taken freight at eight dollars a barrel, and sent her back to New Orleans. Whitney has great esteem for you, and sent me a very handsome note, offering to take anything out in the ""Saxon"" free of expense for me, and praising you highly. The one who had his vessel, I think, he would not care to deal with. I am writing you a miserable letter, but so many things have crowded along I have no time to think. After the Major left I started Paul and your mother by the cars at twelve to go to old Dr. Richardson's, to stay a week. I wish to send this at four for the night train. I have not written for three or four days, and you asked me to write oftener, but I want to see you so much, so very much, and why could I not start in this vessel? That thought will keep my head throbbing all the week. Would you be glad to see me?
Most truly and affectionately, Sarah

"August 26, 1862","Prussian Legation, Washington, Aug. 26, 1862
Hon. William F. Seward
Sir: I have the honor of informing you that by the enclosed general order No. 55, Aug. 4th, of the Commanding General at New Orleans, Major General Butler, a contribution has been enforced upon several commercial houses and persons at New Orleans as a penalty for having invested in a loan effected by that city on the 3d. of March last.
Among the persons assessed for the said contributions are the partners and heirs of the deceased William Vogel, late Consul of Prussia, at New Orleans, and the firm of Reichard & Co., in liquidation, in whose name the subscription to the forementioned city loan was made, invested the questioned money in their capacity as agents for account of the foresaid heirs and partners of Vogel & Co.
I beg to enclose a true statement of the case in a letter of the 7th inst., addressed to General Butler by the Acting Consul of Prussia, J. Kruttschnidt, who is liquidator of the firm of Reichard & Co., and in another letter from the Testamentary Executor of the late William Vogel, Mr. F. Grima, to General Butler on the same subject.
In presenting to you these documents, with a copy of the peremptory answer given by Gen. Butler on the 12th inst., I respectfully express the hope that the explanations contained in these letters will relieve you from any doubt in regard to the injustice done to the parties concerned, in the proceeding of General Butler, and that orders will be given for the redress of their grievances.
I have the honor to be Sir, with great respect
Your obdt. Servt., Baron Fr. Gerolt"
"August 7, 1862","New Orleans 7th August 1862 Major General B. F. Butler, Commanding Department of the Gulf, New Orleans
General: By your general order No. 55 I perceive that, amongst others, the firm of Reichard and Co. is assessed in the sum of $2500 as a contribution to relieve the poor of the city, and as an offset for having contributed $10,000 to the city loan, effected under the city ordnance No. 5949, approved 3rd March last.
I, the undersigned, as liquidator of Reichard and Co., would respectfully represent that the subscription, although made in the name of Reichard and Co., in liquidation, was made in their capacity as agents chiefly, for account of third parties for whom they had money in hand waiting for investments.
The amount $5000 was thus taken for account of Mr. Vogel, and subsequently I took for the same and in his name direct $20,000 more of the loan in question, and out of the
amount originally subscribed by the Citizen's Bank (in schedule A, Widow Vogel is mentioned, which is an error).
The letter, which I addressed under date of 10th March, a. c. to Mrs. Vogel, residing in Paris, shows sufficiently well the reasons which prompted me in subscribing to the question, moreover, as far as Mr. or Mrs. Vogel is concerned, my actions were subordinated to the advice of Mr. C. Roselius, who is the legal advisor of Mrs. Vogel. I wrote to Mrs. Vogel as follows, which is a translation copy,
""New Orleans 10th March 1862
The difficulty which exists today in investing money with security is exceedingly great, it is impossible to find mortgage paper even @ 6% or 5%. By authorization of Mr. Roselius, I agreed to take $5000 of the new city loan, the details of which will be forthcoming in my next. This sum will reduce by about one-half the funds which I now hold for account of Mr. Vogel, and if hereafter I can lay my hands on anything like good securities, you may rest assured that I shall not let the opportunity slip by.""
14th March 1862
P. S. ""Dubois and Mish have paid, day before yesterday, by anticipation their notes of together $28,000, due 18th instant, and in view of the difficulty, not to say the impossibility, to invest money at present, I thought I could do no better than to take $20,000 more of the new city loan, of which mention is made above, for account of Mr. Vogel, making in all $25,000 invested for that account.""
Mr. Vogel has been an absentee for several years, and has been recently declared dead at the beginning of June last by the second District Court, his succession has been opened, Mr. F. Grima has been named testamentary Executor, and I have delivered to him all the assets pertaining to Mr. Vogel's Estate.
Mr. Grima, who is also addressing you in this matter, acknowledges that the succession of Mr. Vogel is interested in said loan to the extent of $25,000, and I would therefore respectfully request you to have the assessment entered against Reichard and Co. diminished accordingly.
In the remaining balance, Mr. F. W. Schmidt, of Hamburg, Germany, is interested to the extent of $2500, -- and as a foreign resident, I may perhaps ask in his favor a total exemption from the effects of the assessment.
I submit this explanation to you with a full belief that your sense of justice will prompt you to grant relief in the premises, and remain, General, with much respect,
Your very obdt. servant, V. Kruttschnidt

General: Reinforcements will be sent to you as early as possible, the new levies are only just beginning to come in and are still unorganized.
I cannot think that there can be a very large force under Van Dorn, as the main army that retreated from Corinth is now operating against Buell and Morgan in Tenn. and Kentucky. They estimate Bragg's forces at over eighty thousand, and it is known that very considerable detachments of Beauregard's army are now in Arkansas and Miss.
It is deemed of the greatest possible importance to hold New Orleans, and reinforcements will be sent as early as possible.

"August 26, 1862","Salem, August 26th, 1862
My dear Butler: I take advantage of the return of Lieut. Allen to New Orleans, to remind you that I still live, and watch each step of your progress with the deepest interest. It is not extraordinary that I should desire now and then to be near you, when I see the complications which surround you; but I am able to subdue every anxiety when I remember the patience, and skill, and prudence, which characterized your career while you were arranging your Expedition here. However much others may have distinguished themselves as generals in this war, no man has carried into the contest any ability as a lawyer, and statesman, and diplomatist, to compare with what you have displayed. I say this not by way of flattery, but for the sake of that encouragement which one friend owes to another, and in order to remind you that in proportion to the magnitude of your active powers, and of your sphere of operations, should be your possession of all
your highest and best faculties. My sermon is ended, and I doubt not you are very glad of it.
The complications of the war, as seen from this point, are amazing. While naval plans have been proposed, and naval enterprizes undertaken by naval Generals; while the minds of our political leaders have been anxiously endeavoring to discover the most profitable use to be made of the negro question, until a sort of popular impatience of confusion has been created at the North, the South have pursued their course with the concentration of the early Christians who were of one mind and one heart. We have been compelled to listen to lunatics when we should have been guided by generals and statesmen. The President has given respectful audience to every mad agitator, whose presumption has been increased by the patience of the administration. Instead of pursuing the plain and simple course laid down by you more than a year ago, on the subject of slavery and the treatment of the negroes, a course which, if adopted manfully, would have silenced all agitation long ago, and would have disarmed hundreds in the South, and strengthened the border states, and given encouragement to the Union men of the North, every foolish and exasperating expedient has been adopted for the sake of preserving that cursed Chicago platform and the Party which made it. The consequences are just what you might expect.
The opposition to all this is rapidly increasing among the laboring men of the North. They desire an honorable peace based on victories for the Union. And when the tide is fully turned that will be the issue. I think anxiety for the Country has at last outstripped anxiety for the negro; and men are looking for and fighting for the blessings which we have enjoyed under the Constitution. Whenever I speak in public now it is for this end, and I always find an enthusiastic audience.
But we must have a victory soon or we are gone, lost. Unless Richmond is occupied before winter by the federal Army Mr. Lincoln cannot complete his term of office. If the question of division does come, God only knows how it will end.
For myself, I farm much, deliver an oration now and then, and wait with patience. Ignoble business, I know, in this crisis. But it is all I can do. And don't discourage me by saying that the day of the civilian is over. I hope you military gentlemen will not entirely usurp all our duties.
I am having an odd difficulty about the charter of the
""Parliament."" Frazer, who agreed to pay me 5 per cent on the charter as compensation for my services, and who, after the charter was taken, endeavored to reduce the rate of my commission, now objects to paying anything, on the ground that my influence had nothing to do with securing the charter. I propose to fight him on this, and beat him too. Did you not understand that George chartered the ""Parliament"" at my solicitation?
God bless you and bring you honorably and gloriously through your task. Remember me to Shepley, if you think of it.
Truly your friend, Geo. B. Loring
P. S. Lieut. Allen is a most worthy gentleman."

Dearest: I wrote you a letter yesterday, but forgot some things I wished to say. The vessel Fisher sends out has been delayed for almost a fortnight. After bursting her escape pipes in Boston, and stopping a week to repair, she was obliged to put into New Bedford from some other damage. I believe she is now off. She has all our pictures cased up in the same
box you sent the plate in with your picture painted on it. If they are lost they can never be replaced. I sent the originals taken years ago of myself and the children. Also the speech copied by Blanche that you sent for. I am very sorry they were not sent by the ""Saxon,"" but we did not know she would be here when they were sent aboard. I trust they will reach you in safety, but fear it will be a long time before you get them. I do not know the name of the vessel. You write of going to Mobile in a month (that would be a fortnight from now) if you can get force enough. Major Strong thinks the Government will send you reinforcements. But it is not likely at so early a period. Nor are you expected to make a move by any person at the north. Indeed there is great fear you will not be able to sustain yourself in New Orleans. Do not think of making a premature start and risk losing what you have gained, that would be fatal; wait till you are fairly reinforced, and the weather cooler. If New Orleans should be taken from us we might as well go into Canada. George -- has applied to Judge -- for information of your life, and he has referred him to Fisher. What is there to say that has not already been written? I could write a life that would interest the reader, but the public can have but a bald outline, and that is rarely correct. The public life of one man will answer well enough for another. The surface of life, if it glitters, is enough for the public. Do you think of anything to suggest that has not been said? I could write you a brilliant history not altogether perfect, that is beyond nature, nor do we expect or wish to find it in any character, it would show but a dead level. It is the opposing elements in a man's nature, strongly developed, but the good triumphing, that excites admiration. These I could picture better than most historians. The gentleman who now offers to sketch your life is an elegant writer, I wish he knew you intimately.

Oh, Dearest, your letter of Aug. 14th is here. Have I hurt you so badly, or is the last page written to rouse me, and show the folly I have been guilty of in writing to you as I did? If I have shown to you that my thoughts went beyond the bounds of sense or reason, forgive me! Do not say you do not wish me to come to you! Or that I need write no more, but to say I am well. I know you do not feel so now, and that you would be glad to have me there, as I should be to be with you. Say so, dearest, in your next letter, and let me join you
again. If that good time ever comes for us to meet, we will return together, or stay away together. I will not come back alone. I am ready ""to tread the weary path"" with you, wherever it leads, and can find no pleasure in any other. If you are to move, I shall find no trouble in moving with you. Bear with my infirmities of feeling as well as you can, I shall improve, believe me. The sad complaining that annoys will wear away. I shall yet walk with ""cheerfulness,"" that ""nympn of healthiest hue"" and ""hope"" will sing again her ""delighted measure!"" Even ""sport"" shall ""leap up, and seize his beechen spear."" So, do not say I must not come but tell me when to start. You did not feel when you began the letter so bitterly as when you closed. Do not think me entirely wrong in what I wrote. If no meaning were given but the one I ought to have shown, that is, how it looked to others, you would not have cause to be angry with me. For in that I wrote truly. You would be subject to comments. But be subject, now, to tenderness, dearest, forget your anger, kiss me, and tell me to come, and make happy

My dear General: Did I not know that with all the mighty cares of your position, your heart has not grown cold toward your friends, I should not venture to again address you upon business matters of my own. As it is I think I shall be pardoned.
The Steamer ""Saxon"" I have ordered back to New Orleans with freight on account of Shippers here. She was offered $450, per day by the U. S. Quarter Master here, to go to Hilton Head, which I refused, as she pays much more by taking freight there, her freight and passage money, both paying as much as 30 days, Government Charter.
I wish to bespeak for the ""Saxon"" your kind indulgence when in New Orleans. She will return immediately to New York, and wishes to bring back passengers and freight. I have sent Mr. Richardson out as Supercargo of ""Saxon,"" who will call upon you. Mr. F. A. Hildreth wrote you yesterday in relation to the ""Saxon"" and ""Relief."" A few moments before the cars left, he received a telegram that the ""Relief"" has stopped at New Bedford, would be detained four days for repairs of her machinery, so that the ""Saxon"" will be in New
Orleans before the ""Relief."" Mr. Hildreth therefore requested me to write you that he desires the ""Saxon"" to take the mails and whatever else you may desire to forward. I hope to forward with Major Giddings a box to your Quarters.
Mr. Hildreth left for New Bedford last night, not having time to write you after receiving telegram in relation to ""Relief.""
And now, General, let me say, your position in your Phelps Correspondence is right, and the Country sustains it, and will sustain and ultimately applaud you. You are the only General in the field whose correspondence will live in History. Pointing to an impregnable necessity in your Phelps letters, you cannot be shaken, and the conservative General is the one that ultimately receives the gratitude of succeeding generations, and the plaudits of the present.

Maj. Gen. Butler
Dear Sir: A messenger came through yesterday from Lafourche with the unwelcome intelligence that my brother was very sick and not like to recover. This, Sir, is all from the inhuman treatment he receives. They are murdering him slowly to get rid of him, so that it will not be said that they hung or shot him for fun, that you might retaliate on those that you hold here. My brother is confined in a filthy place without bed or blanket, and not even a change of clothes. He is not even allowed to go outside of his prison, and is treated to all the vile epithets that can be heaped upon him. My brother, E. W. Burbank, who was taken at about the same time, and afterwards paroled, has after importuning a long time been allowed to go and see him, and is now on the way there, and will do all that he is allowed to for his comfort. I do now beg of you to retaliate on those you hold, as it will certainly procure his release if alive. As long as they are permitted to go at large and enjoy all the comforts of City life, my brother must remain in captivity and be tortured to death by those vile creatures that broke up this glorious Union.
There is a few men on the Coast above the City, if it was convenient, would be well to arrest. One is Capt. Joseph La Bourgeois, who fed and entertained the Rebels the night that they arrested my brother. He had about one month ago a full set of Cavalry equipments that were stolen from the arsenal at Baton Rouge, but I presume are now in the use of the Guerillas. Also, James Godbury and Doct Haidel, who joined the Company in the arrest, and pointed out the place where my brother slept. If these important characters were sent to Fort Jackson it would have a good effect.
I am instructed to ask you to send a gunboat to Berwick's Bay, if it is possible, in order to cut off the supplies of the Rebels near the City. There is now only four Companies this side of Lafourche, but they are expecting reinforcements amounting to three thousand Militia and eight hundred Cavalry. They have now but a very little ammunition and but one or two small pieces of Artillery, and if a gunboat could only be got into Berwick's Bay they could not obtain supplies of any kind.
There is now eight hundred Guerillas at Bonnet Carre,
thirty six miles above the City, and it is also reported that they are building bridges across the streams from Manchac to the Mississippi, and have got them nearly completed.
Gov. Moore has arrested Gen. Robert Martin, of Confederate notoriety, for forbidding any further depredations by the Guerillas on the U. S. transports on the River. The lesson that was taught them at Donaldsonville had a good effect, and I can assure you. Sir, that severity is the only thing that will bring this people to their senses.
There is a great amount of sugar on the coast belonging to the Confederate Gov. Would it not be well to confiscate it before it is all sent to market? It was subscribed to the produce loan of the Confederate Gov. about one year ago.
I presume you know that the Confederates are pressing all into the ranks at the point of the bayonet, and that within a short distance of New Orleans, but they can only arm them with shot guns. I remain

I went with her to the cars. Fisher goes on with them, but thinks he may be obliged to bring them back. All news of the army has been suppressed for the last week. Today we hear that Pope is broken up and the rebels occupy Manassas once more. Their next move must be for Washington, and if our army can do nothing but retreat why may they not take it? Fisher will go from Washington to Fortress Monroe. The steamer he has bought and freighted has sprung a leak, and the Captain has telegraphed for him to come on and see what can be done. The Captain put in at Fortress Monroe. My box of pictures, letters from me and Blanche to you, a copy of the speech you wrote for, a letter from me to Mr. Chubbuck, -- all these were on board. I despair of your ever getting them. I told Fisher to get the box and put it on board another vessel. It is now three weeks on Monday since the letters were sent aboard. The house is more lonely tonight than ever, we miss Blanche so much. I sent the picture of the Crucifixion to the Directress. Caroline came this morning,

My dearest Sarah: Your note of August 10th, finished on the 12th, reached me on the 26th. It was a dear, kind, loving letter -- such a one as gives me new life to receive. I read it over twice. Do write me such letters or none. I cannot live if you write others like those you have written. They are causeless, useless, hurtful. The boat has not yet come with the Daguerreotypes.
Your letters were not lost. They sometimes come two or three at a time. Having written me to burn them, which I have done save the last, I cannot very well send them back. I have been very well except two days when I was a little under the weather.
I am preparing for the defense of New Orleans, and I shall hold it too. Baton Rouge has been evacuated by us without haste, without loss, without trouble of any sort. I could have held it till doomsday so far as the enemy were concerned, and am holding it now with a couple of gunboats, but the whole rebel army of the Southwest are concentrating to move upon me, and I am not in condition to cut my force in halves.
I have brought off the State library and the Statue of Washington by order, beside pretty much all the plunder of the town without order. I have put a stop to that, however. We are fast coming, however, to the point where devastation is a necessity. We have kept out the yellow fever so far, and shall hardly have it to any extent. I believe not at all. They have it fearfully at Key West.
As you will see, the Government have added Pensacola and General Arnold to my command. I will send for him. They have sent me Genl. Sherman, of Port Royal fame, as
Brigadier. You will see my action in regard to Phelps, and also my raising the free colored regiment. Write me what you think of it. I am succeeding admirably with my Louisiana Volunteers.
Andrew is shipping Fisher some thousand hogsheads of sugar. It will be of prime quality and will pay, he thinks. I do not understand Mr. Fay quite, but I think that it is well enough to have the change made. It would hardly do to make it earlier.
Love to the children and Blanche. Tell her that she must write me every week. I can't write her so often as I wish. If she does not write, I won't call her little Buntie any more, but Great Blanche. A thousand kisses for you. Was the wreath pretty? It is of New Orleans make.

General: I have the honor to acknowledge the receipt of yours of the 23rd ult. relating to Lt. J. B. Prince.
This Gentleman came to this department with a commission from the governor of Massachusetts, having been examined by a board of officers under act of Congress while I was in command
of the Department of New England, and rejected because found deficient, -- I thought it my duty before placing him in command to have him again examined.
With pleasure I learned that he had applied himself diligently to the study of his profession, and passed a very satisfactory examination, and he was at once ordered to duty, and I learn behaved very well in the battle of Baton Rouge.
I do not think I need a direct order from the War Department to do my duty. I shall respect Gov. Andrew's commissions when they are respectable, not otherwise.
He has sent down here commissions to annoy me to almost every person whose application for official position I had rejected while recruiting my troops. I have given them their positions when they were qualified, and shall continue to do what I think ought to be done until I am retired from the command of the Department. I have the honor to be,

Mr. Mayor: Upon the withdrawal of the troops from Baton Rouge, to leave the town under the care of the Gun boats, it seemed probable, in case it was stripped to prevent the erection of works there by the enemy, that the State House with its contents would be destroyed. The bricks and mortar could easily be replaced, but not so the works of art which once lost are gone forever. I therefore ordered Powers' Statue of Washington in marble to be removed for safety, and I believe it has been done without injury.
There is in New Orleans no suitable public building wherein the Statue be placed. Besides, in the present temper of mind of the governing class in Louisiana, I do not see what need they have of a Statue of Washington. They are striving to undo his work, to overthrow the Government which was set up more by his agency than all else human. If, indeed, the sight of his calm, noble features would recall them to a sense of duty, loyalty, and submission to that government of which he was the first President, then it would be well to retain the marble here. But alas! Madness rules the hour. The good people are already loyal, and the bad will require sterner and less sentimental arguments for conviction of their folly.
I have taken leave, therefore, to send the Statue to the city of New York, asking the city through the chief executive officer to hold it in trust for the people of the State of Louisiana until such time as they shall return to their senses. When loyalty to the Union and Constitution is restored as the ruling sentiment of Louisiana, and the Government of Washington is recognized by the elected authorities of the State there, let the Statue be sent back to a State fitted to receive it and appreciate it.
The City of New York will accept this trust. With sentiments of respect and esteem, I am,
Most truly yours,

Major General B. F. Butler, Comdg. Dept. of the Gulf
General: The U. S. Steamer ""Tennessee"" from Pensacola found it absolutely necessary to come up to the city last night. She had broken her delivery valve, which is below the water's edge, and the water flowed into her in a very large stream through it. She was only able to keep herself free by means of her steam pumps, when her engines were working; therefore whilst at anchor she was in very great danger of sinking, as her hand pumps were not sufficient to keep her free.
In accordance with the permission sent me last night by you -- ""that if it were an urgent necessity to prevent her from sinking, she could remain,"" I directed her to haul along side the ""Fearnot"" store ship, and discharge as much of her cargo as necessary to lighten her, to prevent her leaking any more, -- and she is now employed doing so.
I had written thus far when your orderly brought me your despatch in relation to the ""Tennessee's"" coming up. I immediately
sent to Capt. Johnson to make a written report of the causes which induced him to break his quarantine. That report I now send you a copy of. You will perceive by it that, in his opinion, the vessel would have sunk at her anchors in a few hours had she remained at the quarantine station. I sent an Officer to you last night to explain these facts to you, which he did correctly.
If the ""Tennessee"" is compelled to return to the quarantine station, she will be compelled to run upon the bank and lie there. If you require her to do so, I will send her down. I am,
Very respectfully, Your obedient Servant,

Sir: The Steamer ""Tennessee"" ran past the Quarantine Station without permission. She was reported to me by an Officer, purporting to come from you, as having done so because she was in a sinking condition. I am now informed that it is not the fact. I assented to her action upon the ground only that it was a matter of necessity.
The ""Tennessee"" must therefore at once leave her Anchorage and proceed below the Quarantine Station. I am grieved and alarmed at this instance of insubordination in the Navy. I am now engaged in a very delicate & troublesome Correspondence with the Spanish Authorities upon the alleged complaint that I treat their vessels different from ours.
This action of the ""Tennessee"" gives color to the complaint and may involve us in a National Difficulty. I shall require the amplest apology from the Officer Comdg. the ""Tennessee."" as well as from the Officer who made the false report to me that she was in a sinking condition, or I shall feel it my duty to report them to the Department, and take such other measures as shall prevent all communication between the fleet and shore while an unquarantined Vessel is suffered to have communication with the fleet.

General: Nothing of interest has occurred to the troops of this Department since the last despatch.
Our disposition being made for defence, the forts which the enemy expected to surprise strengthened, I am inclined to the opinion that he has for the present abandoned his plan of attack. My informers also confirm this view by their intelligence.
Since the plan of attack was abandoned, Breckinridge has gone with a portion of his Division to Mobile, and is said to be en route for Virginia.
The condition of the people here is a very alarming one. They literally come down to starvation. Not only in the city but in the country. Planters, who in peaceful times would have spent the summer at Saratoga, are now on their plantations, essentially without food.
Hundreds weekly by stealth are coming across the Lake to the City, reporting starvation on the Lake shore. I am distributing in various ways about $50,000 per month in food, and more is needed. This is to the whites. My commissary
is issuing rations to the amount of nearly double the amount required by the troops. This is to the blacks.
They are now coming in by hundreds, nay thousands almost daily. Many of the plantations are deserted along the ""coast,"" which in this country's phrase means the River, from the City to Natchez. Crops of sugar-cane are left standing to waste. Guerillas interfere with all white labor, which would be peaceable, and impress it into the Rebel army.
The act of Congress which allows no proper punishment to these marauders renders it impossible to restrain them. It is useless to tell me to try them, send the Record to Washington, and then to shoot them if the Record is approved. Events travel altogether too rapidly for that. In the meantime, they hang every Union man they catch, and by their proclamation (see Governor Moore's on file in the War Department) they threaten to hang every man who has my pass. All this, while they are prating in their papers and by the message of Davis about carrying on a civilized warfare.
We have with us a great many Negro women and children, barefoot and half naked. May I ask in what way in view of the coming winter, these are to be clothed? I can house them. There are houses of rebel Officers enough to cover them. I learn by the Secession Newspapers that I am to be relieved of this Command. If that be so, might I ask that my successor be sent as early as possible, as my own health is not the strongest, and it would seem but fair that he should take some part of the yellow fever season.

I would suggest that the medals for meritorious services, provided by the act of Congress for soldiers in such case, be forwarded to these brave men.
Since I wrote the Commanding General, I am more and more satisfied that the immediate attack upon this City is put off. My information confirms that from every source.
The delay is in part owing to the fact that the enemy is building and altering two Gunboats in the Yazoo River, with which he hopes to embarrass the fleet. A movement from above might destroy those boats, which are only guarded by small militia force: We cannot reach them from below, as we must pass Vicksburg to do it.

General: A press of much more important business engagements have prevented my reporting upon the letter of Captain Porter.
With the Commodore, now Admiral, Farragut, there has been ever the utmost reciprocity of aid and the warmest sympathy.
I was very anxious that the expedition should get off to Vicksburg as early as possible, and I did everything I could do to speed it. Captain Porter in his letter to me expressly so states. The steamer ""Empire Parish,"" which was a boat belonging to a private party here, that had come to the City relying upon the safeguard, was as much within his control as mine. Nay, at the very time Capt. Porter complains, as will be seen by the affidavits herewith submitted, the ""Empire Parish"" was seized by him and wholly under his control. It will be seen also that at the very time Captain Porter complains to the Department of the delays of the Steamer ""Fox,"" she was under the order of Commodore Morris, his senior officer, and in his employ. I enclose the original order which I desire preserved. It is true that the Master of that steamer got drunk and behaved badly at the Passes. That truth Commodore Porter states, but he omits to state that the Master was punished by instant Discharge.
Why suppress the fact which was known to Capt. Porter? If there is a Naval Officer on the station that will not bear the fullest testimony to the exertions of myself and command, to aid the Navy everywhere and at all times with the exception of Captain Porter, they certainly will do very differently from what they have personally stated to me.

Now, dearest, get fat, saucy, and lively; and we will throw away all care and have such a good time. I mean to do nothing but stay at home all through the Indian summer, and ride out on horseback with you. Don't you want to ride? Kiss Paul and Bennie for me -- tell them I am coming home and that we will play ""tag."" Say to them that I am not so

The Quartermaster General
Sir: I am desired to give Messrs. Stanton & Palmer Certificates of the use of their boats, the ""St. Charles"" & the ""Anglo American."" The one was taken possession of on the first of May by the Army, and the second on the 12th of May, and been used till the 28th of July.
I give this Certificate because there is nowhere any Quartermaster whose knowledge covers the whole time as mine does.
There are large repairs done on the ""Anglo American"" before she was fit for use. The ""St. Charles"" was at least one-quarter owned by admitted rebels.
Having agreed that Messrs. Stanton & Palmer should have their boats, having been recovered from the rebels -- one of them captured in rebel military employ, I think the Govt. has done its full duty to these Gentlemen, specially as the Agent of their firm was kept in existence here all through rebel rule here, and the firm actually subscribed $500 to the Two Million defence Loan of the City of New Orleans. In other words, I believe the Government has done its duty to them quite as well as they have to the Government, and if the matter was within my discretion I should not allow the Claim for use of the Boats.

This report having been approved by the President, directions will be given to the Major General, or the commanding officer of the United States at New Orleans, to release the sugars to the claimants.

Sir: You have already been informed that the complaint made by your Legation to this Department, concerning a request or requirement made by Major General Butler, commanding at New Orleans, upon Count Mejan, the French Consul there, that he would retain ($716,196) seven hundred and sixteen thousand, one hundred and ninety-six dollars which he said was deposited with him by Messrs. Dupasseur & Co., was by me referred to the examination of the Honorable Reverdy Johnson, who had been appointed by the President as a Commissioner for this Department.
I have now the honor to inform you that Mr. Johnson has performed the duty confided to him, and has submitted his report thereupon. I think it proper to furnish you with so much of Mr. Johnson's general report as relates to that transaction, and I have further to state that it has been approved by the President.
In accordance with the conclusions of the report, I have the honor to advise you that instructions will at once be given to Major General Butler, or the actual military authority at
New Orleans, to relinquish all claim on behalf of the United States upon the fund in question, so that Count Mejan will be at liberty to pay it to whomsoever may be entitled to receive the same.
I avail myself of this opportunity to renew to you, Sir, the assurances of my high consideration.
William H. Seward
Department of State, Washington, 20th August, 1862
Mr. Roest van Limburg, &c., &c., &c.
Sir: The Honorable Reverdy Johnson, who, as you have heretofore been informed, was appointed by this Department as Commissioner to proceed to New Orleans and investigate, among other affairs, transactions which occurred there affecting the Consul of the Netherlands and certain subjects of the King of the Netherlands, under the direction of Major General Butler, has performed that duty, has submitted his reports concerning the same, and they have been approved by the President.
I have thought it not improper to furnish you, for the information of your Government, a complete copy of so much of those reports as relates to the transaction herein above mentioned.
As a result of the approval of Mr. Johnson's proceeding in the premises, I have now the honor to inform you that the eight hundred thousand dollars in coin which was taken by Colonel Shepley, under direction of Major General Butler, from the possession of Amedie Conturié, the Consul of the Netherlands at New Orleans, and which was claimed to have been deposited with him to the use of Messrs. Hope and Company of Amsterdam, and which is more particularly described in the correspondence which has heretofore taken place between yourself and this Department, will be restored by the Major General, or other United States officer commanding at New Orleans, to either Mr. Conturié, the Consul of the Netherlands, or to Mr. Forstall, as the agent of Messrs. Hope and Company, or to the Citizen's Bank of Louisiana, whichsoever of them you may designate. I refer the designation to yourself, because your Government has intervened in regard to the transaction, whereby its consent to the designation has become necessary, and it will of course be conclusive.
Secondly, I proceed to speak of the articles of property
other than coin, described specifically by part Number Two, in a statement of the said Consul, Mr. Conturié, dated May 13th, 1862, and which was submitted to this Department by you, -- as follows:
""One tin box, to which we give the name of a Bank box in this city locked, containing 1st. Ten bonds of the consolidated debt of the city of New Orleans for (1000) One thousand dollars each, making the nominal value of Ten thousand dollars. 2nd. Eight bonds of the city of Mobile of the value of (1000) One thousand dollars each, the nominal value of which is (8000) Eight thousand dollars, claimed by Mr. Conturie to have been deposited with him on the 12th day of April last by Edmund J. Forstall, Esq., in the capacity of Agent, and as the property of Messrs. Hope and Company. 3rd. Divers papers, being titles and deeds, the Consular Commission of Mr. Conturie and his Executor;
No. 3. Six other tin boxes, marked with the name of Amedie Conturié, containing private deeds, silverware, &c., which boxes are claimed to be the property of divers persons for whom he was acting as agent.
No. 4. Two or more tin boxes, the property of the Hope Insurance Company of the City of New Orleans, which occupied a portion of the premises in which the Consulate is located.""
The extracts from Mr. Johnson's report will show you that under his direction all this property would have been delivered to Mr. Conturié if he had not declined to accept it, for reasons specified by him in a letter to Mr. Johnson. Upon his thus declining, the eighteen bonds were delivered by Major General Butler, under Mr. Johnson's direction, to Mr. Forstall as agent for Messrs. Hope and Company; a copy of his receipt for the same is herewith transmitted to you, and the original will be handed to you or given to whomsoever you may indicate. The other articles named in said statement No. Two, will be delivered by Major General Butler, or other officer commanding at New Orleans, to Mr. Conturié, unless you shall designate some other person to receive them.
In your note of the 28th of July last, you informed me that your government shared the satisfaction which you had experienced when, on a previous occasion, I announced to you that the President and Government of the United States viewed the conduct of the military authorities of New Orleans, in regard to the transactions in which Mr. Conturié, the Consul
of the Netherlands, was concerned, as a violation of the Law of Nations, and that they disapproved of it and disapproved the sanction which had been given to it by Major Genl. Butler. You added, however, that your Government flattered itself that the United States would go farther, and that in the view of the government of the Netherlands the gravity and publicity of the outrage (as you are pleased to call these transactions) demand that the Government of the United States give public evidence of its regret, for example by manifesting by some public act its dissatisfaction with Major General Butler.
You further add that the Government of the Netherlands, considering, until proof is received to the contrary, that Mr. Conturié, its Consul, has acted in good faith, expects that the Government of the United States will not refuse to do likewise, and that it will please, consequently, to invite the Consul, who on the avowal of the American Government itself has been very ill-used, to resume his Consular functions.
I cannot avoid thinking that these requests are made by your Government under a mistaken idea that the United States for some reason desire in some way to cover or conceal from the World the proceedings which they have taken in regard to these questions. If this be true, your Government has fallen into a serious error. The whole of the proceedings have been direct, frank, and unreserved. The United States, as you are aware, did not only express their regret for the transaction and their dissatisfaction with General Butler in the premises in the language you have quoted, but they also sent an Agent to ascertain the extent of the injuries which were complained of, to the end that they might promptly be redressed and that restitution might be made.
That redress has now been made, and that restitution ordered immediately upon the facts on which it depended having been established. Moreover, you were advised in my former communication that, simultaneously with the appointment of Mr. Johnson as Commissioner, Major General Butler was relieved of his functions as Military Governor of New Orleans, and Brigadier General Shepley was appointed military Governor of that city. The Military authorities were at the same time directed to invite Mr. Conturié to resume his Consular functions. These proceedings fully appear in the official correspondence which has taken place between yourself and this department. This correspondence is not a private but a public
one, which your government is at entire liberty to promulgate without reserve whenever it shall please to do so; and, whether your government shall think proper to so promulgate it or not, it will, according to our national habit, be communicated without any reservation to Congress on their assembling here on the first Monday of December next. Nor is it at all a matter of reserve on the part of this Government that the dissatisfaction with Major General Butler's precipitancy and harshness in the transactions concerned were among the causes for transferring the administration of public affairs at New Orleans to General Shepley. It is very true, Sir, as you remark, that Mr. Conturié has been very ill-used, and upon that ground General Shepley will be directed to invite him to resume his consular functions at New Orleans, if indeed he has not done so already under previous instructions. But I must nevertheless accompany this invitation with the declaration that, in the judgment of this Government, Mr. Conturié has acted throughout the transactions which have been reviewed, and even throughout the investigation of them which has taken place, in a manner that was very indiscreet, and calculated, though I presume not intended, to embarrass the relations between your country and our own, and that unless his conduct hence-forth shall exhibit more of consideration for the authority of the United States, it must not be expected that the President will be content with his remaining in the Consulate at New Orleans.
I trust, Sir, that your government will be satisfied that the United States have resolved the questions which have been discussed in a spirit not only of good faith, but also of friendship and good will towards their ancient and esteemed friend, the Netherlands.
I avail myself of this opportunity to renew to you, Sir, the assurance of my very high consideration.

Dearest: Major and Mrs. Bell came today. He brought me your note and the pistol case. They come up on Friday next to spend the day. I was very glad to get your note, and so thankful your annoyance, perhaps I should say your anger, is passed in part. But you are grave, and do not wish me to join you. From anything that I know, I see no likelihood or very little of your returning home this winter. If you are to remain, I should be very sorry to pass the winter here. After the month of October is past, I should have more fear of encountering storms on the coast. I had decided to start the fairest time in the month. I do not think you will be recalled; if someone else is sent to New Orleans, you may still be kept somewhere about the Gulf. If you are to change from point to point, fighting your way, remember I do not trouble you in times of danger; indeed, I hope not to do so at any time, but rather to encourage and sustain so far as my slight ability will permit. Think then, again, if the chances are that you remain, as I think they must be, if you still consider it better to stay there for the next six months without me. If you have a reluctance lest I should embarrass your movements, or any reason why you do not wish me to go, I must cease to urge it. That I would rather go is very clear. In truth, I know not very well how I can stay. Major Strong is on the way to join you, give him my regards and the other gentlemen whom I knew best. Say to Mr. Chubbuck that he has a letter from me, three weeks on the road, and I hear it is now no further advanced than Fortress Monroe. Fisher has not yet returned from Washington. The news is of the most doleful kind. The rebels are within twelve miles of Washington, and Jackson is reported to be advancing on Baltimore by Leesburg with forty thousand men. McClellan commands the defences about Washington. The hospitals, hotels, the college at Georgetown, and even the White House, if I am not mistaken, all are filled with the wounded and dying. The newspapers pour forth exclamations,
and urge the new regiments to hurry forward. The women are packing delicacies and scraping lint. Cincinnati is threatened. The Gov. has proclaimed martial law, stopped business, and ordered the citizens to prepare for defence. The excitement has never been greater or the danger more alarming. I think Fisher will not return without the children. The coming week will have a fearful story for one side or the other; in fact for both. The rebels are attacking at all points, and you expect them at New Orleans. But if you have the Fleet there I cannot think they will venture it. Yet, they seem desperate, so it is well to expect them. Believe me, I am proud enough of you already, and do not want a danger to enhance that feeling. My ""affections do not that way tend,"" nor will I disturb you hereafter with vain imaginings, but write to you all I can gather that I think will interest. I am glad you think your last letter a little too severe. Nothing can exceed the kindliness, the tenderness, I feel toward you, the sympathy and pity, obliged to stay in that hot town while the summer lasts. I have but one regret, that I did not stay with you, yet I believe I should have died if I had tried it. And you could not spare me very well, trouble as I am. The children are very well, and talk much of what you are doing. I shall be all ready when you send for me.

To the Treasurer of the City of New Orleans
Sir: Enclosed herewith please find Three thousand and one hundred and eighty-two 50/100 Dollars, ($3182.50), being the amount recovered by my order from Mr. Pelie, late City Surveyor, which was taken from the Treasury unjustifiably under the following circumstances.
Messrs. Pelie, father and son, have held the office of City Surveyors for forty years or thereabouts. Of course, in the execution of that Office, it was their duty without other reward than their salaries to have put upon the City books all
the real property of the City which had come to their knowledge, and this they did do, -- but Pelie, the younger, being about to resign his Office on the 1st of June last, because he would not take the oath of allegiance, claimed of the City five per cent Commission for property to which he had ascertained the title of the City and put upon his books. This claim covered the time from 1846 to the present.
The finance committee of the Government, themselves about to retire for the same reason, being the same men who had wrongfully invested almost one-third of a million of the Charity fund of the City entrusted to them, approved that bill by means whereof these Three thousand Dollars were taken out of the City without the knowledge of the acting Mayor.
This seemed to be part of the last desperate plunge of the hands of unprincipled men in the City Treasury, and this amount, as soon as it came to my knowledge, I caused to be disgorged and now return it to you. I have the honor to be,

Dearest: Major Bell came today and took dinner with us. Mrs. Bell was sick, she will come up with him next week to pass the day. Of course, I had time to ask a great many questions, and from what he tells me I see no reason why you should not come home. When Gen. Shepley is fairly established nothing could give me so much pleasure, and I know well enough how you would rejoice to come. But for a man holding a position like yours a change requires consideration. What can the Government do with you? It would be easier for them to send you reinforcements to attack in the Gulf, than find a place for you here, unless there is an opening ready for you. They cannot allow a man like you to rest quietly at home. You have shown such efficiency there would be clamour if you were not employed in these disastrous times. You might leave for a time, and try your own powers of persuasion for reinforcements at Washington, but I cannot see how you can be withdrawn from the Gulf until you can be transferred to another place. If Gen. Shepley takes the full authority of a Military Gov., it is clear there is nothing left for you to do in that one town. If he has the ability and energy to hold it
with the force you have there, then it is equally clear that you want a force to do service elsewhere. But I think you will have to come north to get it. And then, if you go back I will return with you. Fisher and George have gone to Baltimore to put their freight on a sailing vessel, the steamer is to be returned to New York and put on the stocks for repairs. I advise them to sell the freight and start new. I shall know when they return. I have told Fisher to bring back the pictures. If ever I get them they will not be sent again, but I will forward copies as soon as I can get them taken, by mail. Blanche and Florence have returned. Our army is driven clear back to their old entrenchments. Two days ago there was a report that Jackson with forty thousand men was in Baltimore, etc. Fisher did not dare to leave them. I shall send them back as soon as there is a feeling of confidence. Mr. Maginnis called, I carried him over to Dracut to see Mrs. Parker at Milton's request, and showed him all necessary attentions. He told me a Mr. Baldwin, to whom you entrusted a letter to me, desired him to say to me that the letter was blown overboard with some letters of credit of his own, by carelessly pulling them out of his pocket while he was on deck. I hope the letter contained nothing of importance. I think it safer always to send by mail unless an intimate friend is coming to the same town you wish to send it. Now I must tell you something funny. You sent me the key to the pistol case, and asked me to be careful of it as you valued it highly as a present. I took one glance and felt no further curiosity until today, nearly a week from the time it came. I must say on examination they are the finest possible. I do not wonder you desired me to take care of them. They are the prettiest gems of pistols, -- if ever I fight a duel it shall be with these, and you shall figure as second. What do you think, dearest, the summer is over with us, almost with you, how I have wished it away; one month more and the danger of climate is over. I am less oppressed with anxiety and restlessness, and am really getting flesh, and spirits to move with life and pleasure. Would you like to see me gay, saucy, and a little boisterous when you return? If you are thin, the voyage home will bring you up, and after a week at home the whole expedition with all its attendant dangers will seem like a romance read of another's life. You will be welcomed by all, but by none so dearly as I shall welcome you.

My dear General: My father has forwarded to me yours of 17th with his answer, which I confirm as precisely correct. Your misapprehension arises from my having opened two accounts with you on my books, one for the money and dividends you left with me, and the other for our business transactions since your departure. So far from orediting the Govt. the Naval Paymasters' draft $10,000.00, I have credited the Govt. nothing. Everything shipped by you, or its proceeds, stands to your individual credit, and is subject to your draft or order, with the exception of the profits upon your first four shipments. These amounts I cannot pay to any one until it is decided between you and the Dept. to whom it belongs. I am joint agent of yourself and the Govt., and I mean to do my duty equally to both. It is only since Col. Butler has sent me corrected invoices of these shipments that I have known what these profits were. From your present letter I presume that 12% exchange for prem. on gold is to be added to the cost of the goods, and I shall so add it. Please remark that this is the first time that I have had the materials for making up this account correctly furnished to me.
On my return to Boston, I shall have the pleasure of sending you account sales of these cargoes, having already sent Col. Butler sales of all subsequent ones. I shall also enclose you a copy of your letter accompanying the first invoices, containing distinct instructions to offer this mdse. to the Govt., and enclosing a letter to the Sec'y. of War offering them yourself. In my opinion the letter is capable of but one construction, that upon which I acted. You say in the letter I have just received, ""I wish to know that I am not wronged in the account."" If you alluded to my account, or to my acts for your account, I shall feel obliged if you will name some one versed in business to whom I may turn over your affairs, after satisfying him that my stewardship has been honest if not able. I do not think, however, you have any such meaning, but are annoyed through the misapprehension I have already alluded to. I am very sorry to learn that you are in trouble at New Orleans through the neglect of the Dept. No one has deserved its cordial support so well, and if through their fault you lose the splendid position you have gained, they will deserve and obtain the unbounded execration of every
decent man at the North. The administration has forfeited all confidence, it is unsuccessful in everything, in choice of men and planning of measures, it has proved utterly weak, vacillating, and cowardly. I believe as fully as I believe anything that there are impending such disasters as will compel a change not only of our rulers but of our form of Government, and that we shall be purified by fire to a better order of things,
If matters in New Orleans take the course you apprehend. I suppose any shipments there will be nearly a total loss. It will take pretty nearly all I am worth, but I should care little for that compared to the injury to the cause that the loss of the city would prove.
The story of the recent fighting before Richmond is as usual, defeat and disaster to our forces. If the enemy does not take Baltimore, it will be because he does not want it. I am here for my health, which is very much impaired by my hard summer's work. I return to Boston in about a week

Hon. William Barney, Collector of Customs, N. Y.
Sir: Since the first day of June last, the date of the President's Proclamation declaring the ports of New Orleans, Port Royal, and Beauport open to the Commerce of the World, one hundred and sixty-two vessels, many of them large Steamers, have been cleared at this port with Cargoes for the port
of New Orleans alone. On opening these ports, it was deemed prudent by the Treasury Department to declare certain goods contraband of War, a list of which has been furnished this office, and by which we have been governed.
This list, it will be perceived, left a wide margin for shipments, and our merchants have availed themselves very largely of the privilege of shipping such goods as are not included in this Schedule, on which, in some instances, fortunes have been made by a single venture.
Steamers have been chartered, at the round sum of one thousand dollars per day, for a voyage out and back, usually occupying at least three weeks, and the charterers have in some instances paid the entire amount of the charter by the sale of the single article of flour on arrival out. Immense quantities of almost every variety of goods, among which may be mentioned the item of ninety thousand barrels of flour, have been sent from this port: more than sufficient, it would seem, to supply the wants of the city, and it is believed that a large portion of the goods thus hurried into New Orleans will find its way into the hands of those who favor the interest of the rebels.
The high prices ruling in rebeldom on certain articles offer great inducements to men of ""easy loyalty"" to supply the wants and necessities of the rebels, and when trade is so brisk and so varied as it necessarily must be, at the present time, it cannot reasonably be expected that the rules be confined to loyal persons.
Take, for example, the article of Sulphate of Quinine, which is not included in the list of articles declared contraband by the Secretary of the Treasury, and we can see at once the extraordinary inducements offered to smuggle it into the rebel army. It is estimated that at least twenty-five thousand ounces of this, to them indispensable medicine, have been shipped at this port alone for New Orleans since the first day of June; an amount which no one for a moment believes is required or needed for the use of our army, or the loyal people at that port. While the prices here have varied from two to two and a half dollars per ounce, the rebels have paid as high as sixty dollars per ounce for it. Other articles of a similar character, such as morphine, chloroform, surgical instruments, and many other articles sadly needed in the rebel army, it is believed, have found their way into rebel hands by reason of the enormous prices ruling there, and if so, the opening of
these ports may be considered of doubtful benefit and may perhaps be the means of prolonging the War.
Respectfully submitted, Sidney S. Norton"
"September 8, 1862","Head Quarters Dist. Westn. La., Thibodeauxville, Sept. 8, 1862
Major General B. F. Butler, Commanding U. S. Forces at New Orleans
General: I send the Hon. R. C. Wickliffe, a distinguished citizen and a former Governor of the state of Louisiana, as the bearer of this communication to you.
My object in making it is, in the first place, to inform you that by appointment of my Government I am in command of all that portion of Louisiana which lies west of the Mississippi river, and farther to state that the troops with which I have hitherto conducted and shall continue to conduct military operations in this District, are men only as have been regularly enrolled in the service of the Confederate States, together with the State forces which have been turned over to me by the Governor of Louisiana under the laws of the State and of the Confederate States.
My main object, however, is to address you as the Senior officer of the United States Government in charge of its forces waging war in this portion of the Confederate States, with respect to some recent occurrence in this state by troops under your command.
Marauding expeditions, started either from the city of New Orleans or from some point on the Opelomay Rail Road, have fallen upon the line of coast on both banks of the Mississippi River for a space of at least thirty miles above the city. Their track has been marked with devastation and ruin. The dwellings of its peaceable and unoffending inhabitants have been entered and pillaged by a ruthless soldiery. Every movable object upon their plantation and in their homes has been either carried off or destroyed -- nor has there been any distinction of person or of sex. The rich and the poor made to suffer alike, women and children have been exposed to indecent search, and articles of apparel or of ornament taken from their person.
I do not derive the knowledge of this condition of things from the sufferers alone -- letters written and diaries kept by officers and men, some of the very parties engaged in these lawless and inhuman acts, whom the fortune of war has placed
in my hands, discloses a scene the horrors of which no language can exaggerate.
I hesitate to believe that these excesses can have been sanctioned by the authorities of the United States, who are responsible for the proper conduct of their troops in the localities they occupy; or that the well-known perpetrators of them will be permitted to go unpunished. I need not say that this is not civilized warfare, and that the sanction or tolerance of it by your Government will lead to the most summary reprisals by my own.
I have in my possession one hundred and thirty-six of your officers and men, the survivors of one of these predatory bands. Many of them when taken were found with objects of more or less value which they had plundered from our helpless citizens. I have determined to suspend the operation of the General cartel with respect to these men, until I can communicate with and receive instructions from my Government. But in order to protect for the future the non-combatants residing within my district from the repetition of their acts of lawless violence, I shall be compelled to work the most stringent measures I have it in my power to adopt.
I have accordingly to notify you that upon a repetition of them, I shall select by lot from among the prisoners in my hands ten officers and men for immediate execution; leaving the responsibility for inaugurating this system of warfare to act upon your Government, to which for its toleration of this conduct of its troops it will properly belong. I am, General,
Your obt. servt., R. Taylor,
Maj. Gen. Comdg. Dist. Western, La."
"September 10, 1862","Headquarters Department of the Gulf, New Orleans, Sept. 10th, 1862
General Richard Taylor, Commanding
General: I received your letter by the Hon. R. C. Wickliffe, in whom I at once recognized a gentleman of the highest respectability, but I take leave to suggest that a flag of truce, bearing communications from one military officer to another, is usually in charge of an officer of the Command of the party sending it.
I am pleased to be informed as to the Command of the Confederate forces on the Western side of the Mississippi.
No information has reached these Headquarters, save by your note, of the occurrences of which you write. The troops at the Bayou des Allemands were an advance post guarding a Railroad bridge, and not an expedition at all, nor were they allowed to go on any expedition up the coast or elsewhere, so that upon this topic I am constrained to believe you were misinformed.
I need not say that acts such as you describe are neither ordered nor tolerated by the Government or by myself. I enclose a copy of my General Orders and also the Orders of the War Department upon this subject.
That unlicensed acts are committed by troops on marching service is the well-known fact of all civilized warfare.
If any deeds such as you describe have been committed, and you will send me the written evidence which you may have, together with the parties, my acts heretofore should convince you that they will be properly punished. Therefore, if you have the guilty parties you will do well to allow them to be exchanged, as it will be impossible for me to ascertain their guilt if you retain them.
I could have wished that this answer to your communication could have ended here, and that you could have contented yourself not to threaten.
It is true you have 136 men duly enlisted in the 8th Vermont Regiment, including their officers. But how captured? In part by ambush of a supply train. This savors rather of Indian than of civilized warfare. ""But the worst remains behind."" I am informed that the Guerilla force which made the capture of the Post at Bayou des Allemands raised a flag of truce, that it was answered by another flag from my men, the bearers of which were seized and detained. That a second flag was sent out to request the return of the first, that this also was seized, and the bearers of both were placed at the head of the advancing column so that my men could fire only upon their friends. Is this civilized or savage warfare? It reads precisely like the history of similar strategy by Toussaint l'Ouverture toward the French forces in San Domingo, and would seem therefore to be not even original.
I say most unhesitatingly, General, that I do not suspect even that this act was in any way known to or sanctioned by yourself, educated in the United States and the son of one who led the United States Army to victory, and died the recipient of his whole country's highest honors.
The mischief arises from the employment of a Guerilla force of undisciplined and lawless men, brought from a neighboring state into a community where they have neither interest nor restraint. Now, I am aware that your authorities have called this force ""Partisan Rangers,"" but that neither alters their conditions, their habits, their disposition, or acts. Lawless violence has been and will ever be the distinguishing character of such force. Organized originally in Spain and Mexico, from a part which these men came, it is known what they will do, nay what they must do. Now, although I have some thirty of the very men who so abused a flag of truce, I shall make no threats of reprisal.
I take leave to call your attention to the fact that I submitted through Mr. Deslonde a proposition to you that some arrangement may be made by which non-combatants might have some protection from the severities and hardships of war. You are reported to me by Thos. O. Moore, who assumed to be the Commander of the forces at Opelousas, and took upon himself to answer my communication to that officer, through some supposed. Adjutant General, to have declined any arrangement for the protection of non-combatants, because they would need none if the war was conducted on our side as the Confederate Government has always conducted it, according to the rules of civilized warfare.
I am at a loss to distinguish between the conduct of the State and the Confederate Governments.
If the proclamation of the late Governor Moore, which promises short shrift to those who may even buy provisions to keep them from starving in New Orleans, which threatens each person leaving my lines with my pass with imprisonment; if, in its intent, its meaning, and scope that Proclamation is according to any rules or usage of either civilized or uncivilized warfare, I have failed to have been informed of them.
That burning cotton of peaceable planters, rolling their sugar into the river, and destroying their sugar houses, as has been done all along the river by ""Partisan Rangers,"" and that too to their very friends and sympathizers for the crime of only desiring to sell their crop and getting something to buy provisions for themselves and their negroes, is not civilized, I certainly need not remind a late soldier of the United States Army.
Firing upon an unarmed boat filled with women and female
school children, and almost with those only, is neither civilized nor brave.
As an example of the unacquaintance [with] the rules of civilized warfare of a portion of the forces under your command, please take the firing of thirty men, protected by a village, with double-barrel shot-guns, upon a United States Steam Sloop of War passing quietly down the river.
I shall only fatigue you by enumeration. I have within my lines and my power five times one hundred and thirty officers and men of the Confederate Service as prisoners of war, from a Brigadier General to the inconsiderate lad of sixteen. I shall treat these with every courtesy due their position. No hair on the head of one of my captured soldiers ought to be touched upon any pretext of reprisal or retaliation. I trust you will reconsider your determination to do so in any event.
That I punish the guilty marauders with promptness, the women and children of New Orleans who sleep in calm undisturbed quiet under our flag will tell you. That I deal generously with my enemies, a thousand and nineteen families of Confederate soldiers, now being fed from my rations will testify. That I will take care of, protect, and avenge the wrongs and lives of my fellow-soldiers, confided to my care, you, as a soldier, can judge. I have the honor to be,
Your obdt. Servant,
Benj. F. Butler, Major Gen. Comd'g
P. S. Since writing this note, I have received a letter from Commander Porter. If true it only adds another example of the infelicity of employing such Partisan forces. If false, it shows the danger of reprisals and retaliation upon any report whatever.

"September 9, 1862","Headquarters Department of the Gulf, New Orleans, Sept. 9th, 1862
My dear wife: I enclose your two last letters according to request, and farther give you an account of my health in full as you request. I cannot write at length as my right hand is quite stiff from the effects of a large boil on the back of it. I have one or two more on various parts of the arm which are quite troublesome. Otherwise my constitutional health is good. We are all troubled here with what is known as ""prickly heat,"" i. e., eruptions on various parts of the body, like the rash. This I have had to some extent on the arms and legs. It seems to be nothing more or less than this. The skin kept in a high state of perspiration, and thus moist, becomes at last inflamed, and thus endeavors to restore itself, but the eruptions being over so large a surface cannot allow the skin to clear itself of all the secretions, and therefore they are discharged through larger eruptions known as boils. I learn that all this people are afflicted with boils, and some of them to a fearful extent. My surgeon, Dr. McCormick, tells
me that when he formerly practised here he knew one lady that had three thousand, and another five thousand boils, but the last died of them. All this disappears when the weather becomes cooler. We have all had it, especially the fleshy ones -- Andrew and French, although I hardly reckon myself amongst that number.
The city still continues healthy. My command is saved wonderfully in health. Many of the officers have been frightened home by fear of yellow fever, which, although they have managed to get it in the fleet over at Pensacola, and I have [it] down at the Quarantine here, yet we have kept out of the city.
You did me great wrong in your letter, and I replied to it as I felt -- pity, anger, sorrow, indignation, all were, as they rose, penned down. Why do you take such foolish notions? I can take care of my own honor among women or men.
We are in receipt here of very terrible news from the Potomac, nothing less than the rout of McClellan's entire army. If true, I shall have trouble enough here, but fear not. We shall hold New Orleans. Indeed I think they had better move the Capital here as the safest place. Do not doubt that I would be glad to see you and have you here. It is not time now to come. No need to expose yourself either to fever on land or the hurricane at sea. I will write you when I think you can come. Another difficulty is if you come we shall have every soldier in the division asking to bring his wife; they are beginning to do it now. The ""Relief"" (Fisher's Boat) has not yet made her appearance. I know not what her cargo is, no invoice having been sent forward, but this delay will make it an unprofitable one. Fisher need not come out here, indeed he must not.
But why do I talk of this. If the news is true, we are all required to look a sterner reality in the face than has yet been done. This war must then be carried on as one of extermination until any white man not a United States soldier, or openly and fully acting with the Government, is exterminated. Indeed, I don't see but we must fight for our own existence. It is coming -- a ""Military Dictator."" God grant the man may be one of power and administrative capacity. Let it come -- the man has not developed himself yet -- but he will -- in the field too, before long. The day of small expedients and small men is getting by. Well, an empire is the repose as it is the ripeness of nations.
I only wish they would recall me from this place -- important enough no doubt -- but only Lieutenancy, something too much of this.
Yours, B. F. Butler
P. S. You will see, dearest, by the signature how much the mind wandered away from the thought of writing you. I do kiss you and love you, but let me do so without wounding me. Benj."

My dear Admiral: A week or two since there were imminent threats of attack upon New Orleans. I believe now that has been put off till about the middle of October, when the iron-clad fleet in the Yazoo will be finished. This my information gives as the settled plan. The Government should give us one of the new iron-clads to end these hopes of the rebels.
I have now an expedition up river under convoy of the ""Mississippi."" The ""Essex"" is here, not at the mouth of Red River where she is needed.
I will be able, I think, to aid you at Mobile, at any rate I will see you within the next ten days. It would be impossible to spare the ""New London"" on the Lake. I am causing a crew to be enlisted for the ""Calhoun."" We shall need her also to be just as we would be in event of an attack.

Those were used in indispensable repairs, and she was run up the coast until a change of military operations rendered it no longer profitable. If there is any reason to believe that an untrue account has been rendered send the facts on which the belief is based and I will investigate it. If the Government proposed to give four hundred and fifty dollars a day fee to go anywhere, I think the owners were not wise in not accepting the proposal. It is more than she is worth any where.

Major General Halleck, Commanding Armies of the U. S.
General: I have the honor to report that on Saturday, the 7th, a regiment of Partisan Texas Rangers, under the command of Major Walles, ambushed a detachment of the advanced Pickets of the 8th Vermont Volunteers at the Bayou Des Allemands, 32 miles from Algiers, on the railroad when they were coming down to Algiers for provisions, and wounded a number of them. The Guerillas then proceeded to the Bayou, and by means of abuse of a Flag of truce to which they induced an answer, and then seized the bearers and put them in front of their column of attack, caused a surrender of the remainder before the supporting force could reach them.
These supports were detained by the unfortunate accident of running an ox upon the track, which broke up the train and wounded several of the troops. Still, I cannot approve of the conduct of the pickets in not holding out and making a contest, as they would have been immediately supported. Emboldened by this success, this Cavalry force made their appearance on the West River Bank, some thirty miles above the city. I immediately ordered Col. McMillan to take a portion of the 21st Indiana Regiment and 9th Conn. and land below them, and asked Commodore Morris to send a gunboat up the Mississippi to cover the landing in case the enemy should be supported by artillery, which request was promptly complied with.
The movement was admirably executed, and resulted in hemming in between the river and the swamp the entire body of Guerillas.
Upon being called upon to surrender, they fled from their horses into the swamp, and were then pursued by our men, who succeeded in capturing some forty prisoners including several officers; 250 horses with their equipment, which could not be taken into the swamps.
The enemy lost 8 killed and wounded. This Guerilla force, which has been the terror of all that part of the country, has been thus thoroughly disposed, dismounted, and disorganized.
I will endeavor as soon as I get reinforcements to organize an expedition which shall relieve the Western part of Louisiana from the presence of any force of enemy.
I am convinced that all attempts upon New Orleans are abandoned for the present, and that the enemy await the finishing of the iron-clad boats which they are making near the mouth of the Yazoo River. These they expect to finish by the middle of October. I am

Sir: The Secretary of War directs me to transmit to you the enclosed copies of a correspondence which has taken place between the Minister of Spain and the State Department, touching your action in regard to the house of Messrs Avendano Brothers, at New Orleans, and to request such explanations as will enable the Secretary of State to answer the complaint in question.
Very respectfully, Your obedient Servant,
P. H. Watson Assistant Secretary of War
Translation. Legation of Spain, Washington, 26 August, 1862
Hon. Wm. H. Seward, Secretary of State of the U. S.
The undersigned, Envoy Extraordinary and Minister Plenipotentiary of H. Catholic Majesty, has the honor to call the attention of the Honorable Secretary of State of the United States to the facts which are related in continuation.
 -- 280  -- A Confederate steamer being captured in Berwick Bay, coming from the Havana, there were found on board of her some letters addressed to the Spanish house of Avendano Brothers at New Orleans, one of them containing invoices of goods sent in consignment, but not for account of said house, by different vessels, and a bill to their order for some hundred dollars.
A few days after this event above cited occurred. Messrs. Avendano received a note from General Butler saying that he wished to see them. One of the individuals of the house went to him, and General Butler showed him the letter of which mention has been made, the bill and two others -- seconds -- for value of 1900 sterling pounds, on London, requiring payment of the amount.
The representative of Avendano's house assured him that it had nothing to do with those bills, because they did not know, even by name, the persons, by whom they were drawn, but his protestations served no purpose unless to enrage the General, who insisted on his pretentions under penalty of imprisonment in Fort Jackson, &c., directing at once that he should be kept under arrest, and next ordering an officer to take possession of the correspondence which should be found in the counting house.
In this state of things. Messrs. Avendano instructed a lawyer to see General Butler and cause him to understand the injustice he had done against them. The General admitted that the bills and even the goods pointed out by the invoices were not in fact the property of these gentlemen, but -- added he -- the gains they must have made by the exportation of cotton and importation of arms must have been so much augmented that they may consider themselves very fortunate if they are not compelled to pay a larger sum.
In face of this violence, there was no remedy but to yield, and Messrs. Avendano, fearing to become the victims of an outrage, signed a bill of exchange to the order of General Butler for the value of 1900 pounds or $9000 dollars. Then, and then only, was the arrested partner, who had meantime been at large on bail, set completely at liberty. It should still be added that the head of the house, Don Peregrim Avendano, not yet knowing to what he might not be exposed, judging from the past oppressions, resolved to go to the Island of Cuba, as in fact he has, abandoning his business.
The undersigned deplores the necessity under which he is
placed of complaining so repeatedly of the proceedings of the Military Authority at New Orleans in regard to the subjects of her Catholic Majesty. The exaction of which Messrs. Avendano have been the subjects is a new and odious arbitrariness, and the charge informally specified against them cannot be anything else but a pretext to cover it up.
The Spanish Government has no need to repeat that it withdraws its protection from those of its subjects who break the laws of neutrality in the contests in this country. But besides, vague asseverations are not sufficient to prove an offence, especially in particulars such as the violation of a blockade, which frequently bears its punishment with it, and which, even when established, cannot yet palliate such down-right injustice as that mentioned.
The Government of the United States is therefore under obligation to make restitution of the sum of $9000, extorted by violence from Messrs. Avendano no less than of the correspondence, which the said house was also compelled to deliver, being in addition responsible for the damages and indemnities which the case requires.
The undersigned does not question the proper disposition of the Government of the United States to give effect to its protection of Spanish subjects residing in this country, but in the presence of facts of the nature of those which are taking place at New Orleans, such protection seems to be null or insufficient, and such abuses demand urgent remedy.
The undersigned avails of this occasion to reiterate to the Hon. W. H. Seward the assurance of his highest consideration.
Gabriel G. Tarsara
Department of State, Washington, 9th, 1862
Senor Don Gabriel Garcia Tarsara
Sir: The note which your Excellency addressed to me on the 26th of August, during my absence from this city, has only just now been received. It prefers a complaint by your Government made in behalf of the Spanish House of Messrs. Avendano Brothers, at New Orleans, for severities and exactions alleged to have been committed there by Major General Butler while in the military command of that city. More especially it alleges that, without sufficient cause or grounds, General Butler exacted of the aforesaid house, under threats of violence, a bill of exchange for £1900, equal to nine thousand six hundred dollars.
 -- 282  -- This complaint is a very grave one. The President, of course, is not prepared to believe that it is justly made. You may, however, without hesitation, assure your Government that an investigation of it will be made with the least possible delay, and that ample redress will be promptly given if Major General Butler shall fail to justify his proceedings in the transaction.
The Government is above all things desirous to direct its proceedings in suppressing the present insurrection in such a manner as to do no wrong to individuals, and especially to the subjects of friendly nations. The present seems to be a proper occasion for me to inform you that Brigadier General Shepley, who some time ago was appointed Military Governor of Louisiana, has now assumed that office and is charged with the conduct of civil affairs in that State.
It may some time happen that difference of opinion may arise between this Government and of Spain upon the merits of complaint made by the subjects of Spain against the American authorities, or complaints made by citizens of the United States against the authorities of Spain. In view of such a possibility, I beg leave to suggest the expediency of establishing a joint commission for their settlement, to be composed of Commissioners mutually agreed upon by the two Governments. A similar proposition has been made by the United States to Great Britain and it is understood that there is a probability of its acceptance.
I avail myself of this occasion to offer to you renewed assurances of my highest consideration.

General: In the present distracted state of affairs here at the North, there seems very little chance for immediate assistance for those of you at the South. Indeed, you can get no one to listen to you at Washington on account of the terror. A very few days will undoubtedly set matters to running in the other direction, and so soon as that is done you will have no want of troops. In the meantime, you must do as you always have heretofore done, take care of yourself and of those who ought to assist you. There have been nonsensical rumors that General Dix, and General Cadwallader, were to supercede you. There is nothing whatever in this that a reasonable man can discover. They are mere newspaper rumors. The entire people here are with you, great and small and of all complexions. I believe that they would be glad to see you at home to take general command, but for that and for no less a purpose. So said Mr. Chief Justice Bigelow, speaking from his heart. The condition of the country is lamentable beyond expression, party feeling quite as bitter as ever, and a general distrust of everybody and everything the rule. Defeats only seem to make this distrust more fearful. If a change does not speedily come over us the result will be fearful. Nothing can be done for you here, you have already done everything for yourself. If any fool shall remove you it will be your gain every way, but there is no danger of that.
I have had the pleasure of seeing Mrs. Butler twice since my return, and found her well and happy though a little anxious. Your place looks to-day like Paradise. Personally I was never so well as at the South, for I have had a miserable time since I got home with each particular bowel and inward, but am pulling up and hope soon to start on my return.
I found here Capt. Clark and old Shaffer, who are full of good news. Please to present my regards to the staff and believe me, General,

My dear General: I have wished for some time to send you a line to congratulate you upon the success you are meeting with, and the constantly augmentative fame you are winning in your military department. All classes of men and all shades of opinion unite in your commendation, and the very attacks made upon some of your orders by the enemies of the Union greatly promote you in the affections of your country men.
I have watched your entire course and read all your printed orders and proclamations with the greatest satisfaction, and I think you have been equally felicitous in disposing of the she adders and the rich rebels, who have by their money sustained the rebellion and the negro militia of Louisiana.
I do not know what trials or even reverses may be in store for you, as enough of calamities just now are falling upon us in every direction, but the past is secure, and the record of your military and political administration as Dictator in New Orleans, for such in fact you have been, will be one that you and your children must always read with pride and unalloyed satisfaction.
It won't do you any good to know that these are my sentiments, but it is a pleasure to me to express them and to subscribe myself,
Very respectfully, and Faithfully your friend,
Dwight Foster
P. S. You are fortunate indeed to be out of the atmosphere of suspicion, recrimination and mortification which has for some time enveloped every General commanding in Virginia."

Dear General: We arrived yesterday. We found public affairs in the saddest condition; Pope beaten and banished, and the people following leaders whom they fear. But you will know all this from so many sources, it is not worth while for me to trouble.
We telegraphed for Major Bell last night, and he is with us this morning. His advice was needed. He tells me -- as I had learned the fact from another source -- that Johnson and Bullett were working for the negro men and for the negro men alone.
Andrew was re-nominated yesterday. He will be re-elected. Sumner will try hard for the Senatorship, but he will find opponents in his own party.
Maine has elected a Democrat to Congress.
I find, among those I talk with, little of what we call patriotism. The leaders of ""the Party"" are selfish.
I shall be in Boston in a day or two, and shall from direct observation strive to learn something of our political condition in Baltimore.
Major Bell and Col. Shaffer have written fully on the chief matter in hand.

As in the course of ten days it may become necessary to distinguish the disloyal from the loyal citizens and honest neutral foreigners residing in this Department:
It is ordered, that each neutral foreigner, resident in this Department, shall present himself, with the evidence of his nationality, to the nearest Provost Marshal for registration of himself and his family.
This registration shall include the following particulars:
The country of birth; the length of time the person has resided within the United States; the names of his family; the present place of residence, by street, number or other description; the occupation; the date of protection or certificate of nationality, which shall be indorsed by the Passport Clerk, ""Registered,"" with date of register.

We have no news from home directly since the 30th. Your last was dated the 27th. We have daily telegrams that Washington and Cincinnati are taken through secession. What can be doing up there unless all their telegrams are false. We can hardly tell what to think. We have Pope's despatch claiming a victory on the 30th. We have Davis appointing a day of thanksgiving for victory on the same thirtieth. ""It's a muddle."" Indeed, I think the only safe place is New Orleans. They have given up all hopes of attack here for the present. Have withdrawn their forces, substantially, and left us to ourselves. I am growing very uneasy, and shall soon follow them and ship all that remains of them out of the state.
I have heard nothing of the Steamer ""Relief"" yet. She must be now out 20 days. Nor of the ""Saxon.""
I am sure you had better not come out here till the first of October, and then I shall be glad to see you if you are in good flesh. Not otherwise, as you will run down even during the Winter. Seriously, lovingly, with every kind thought, hope, and wish, I would be very happy; very, very pleased;
very, very content; very very much solaced to have you come if you are only happy, contented, pleased, solaced. I cannot endure to see you unhappy, that operates on me, and from its effect I make you more and more unhappy.
I would indeed I were at home at once, if only this war was going well. I hope for the best for my country. But these reverses are hard to bear.
Phelps goes home by the Steamer. He has given his horse, epaulettes, sash, and spurs to Weitzel.
Strong starts on a little expedition tonight. I hope for his sake it will be successful. He hopes to win his spurs.

Sir: I send enclosed herewith the communication referred to me by Commodore Morris.
I need not tell you that I do all in my power to prevent either pillage or plunder. The boats were sent to obtain sugar for the Commissaries of this Department, a matter not subject of criticism by Lieut, Roy.
The tenor of the whole communication is so remarkable that I forward it to the Navy Department with the indorsement made by me at the time of its receipt. I have the honor to be

U. S. Gunboat Katahdin, Miss. River, Sept. 11th, 1862
Commodore H. W. Morris, Commanding Naval Forces
Sir: I was overhauled yesterday by Lieut. Commd'g Lowery of the ""Scotia"" while at Bonne Carre' Point, and directed by him to follow on as convoy of their transports of the U. S. Army.
Upon arriving at Donaldsonville this day, the transports landed at the upper part of this town, landed a party of troops and commenced receiving on board sugar and other merchandise.
A few hours later I received positive information that a company of these troops had entered a large mansion situated near the landing of the Steamer ""St. Maurice,"" had pillaged it in a brutal manner, and carried off wines, liquors, silver plate, and clothing belonging to ladies. I am informed that several of the soldiers were drunk from the use of the liquor and wine thus appropriated. This house was inhabited in the morning. During this time the ""Katahdin"" was at anchor with her big guns trained upon the shore over the ""St. Matahda,"" and to be used for protection.
I respectfully request instruction if the guns of the ""Katahdin"" are to be used for the protection of the soldiers upon a marauding expedition, and if I am to use them in the protection of drunken, undisciplined, and licentious troops in the wanton pillage of a private mansion, of wines, plates, silk dresses, the misses' and female apparel, to say nothing of the confiscation of sugar, which I believe to be without proper and lawful reasons therefore.
I confess, Sir, that I blush to report that while the troops of the ""St. Maurice"" were thus engaged in this unsoldierly and ungallant, not to say disgraceful operation, I opened my fire upon Guerillas hovering in the rear, apparently occupied in preventing such acts of the U. S. troops.
I feel quite ready to place the ""Katahdin"" and her guns under the fire of an enemy. I am desirous of encountering enemies and of injuring them in every manly way, but I cannot further prostitute the dignity of my profession, as I conceive I have done to-day, without an earnest and respectful appeal to your authority. It is disgraceful and humiliating to me to be ordered on guard duty of soldiers employed in pillaging ladies' dresses and petticoats, and I respectfully request that I may be relieved from such service.

"September 14, 1862","Boston, Sept. 14, 1862
Dear General: I returned yesterday from an absence of a fortnight and find your letters of 20th and 1st., introducing Mr. Bonfanti and advising drafts, also a letter from Col. Butler advising your draft for $50,000, and requesting me to transfer his balance in my hands to your credit, which I have done in conformity to the amount of $20,174.32. I charge your drafts: --
Sight: $1,200.00
5% Specie and premium: $29,212.50
Sights: $25,000.00
Sights: $50,000.00
Mr. Bonfanti: $8,470.00
Total: $113,882.50
If you can do so without much difference, it would be much more comfortable to me if you will draw (large sums) at 10 days or even 3 days sight. My return yesterday was fortunate, as it taxed my credit pretty sharply to raise $75,000 in a morning, my money being lent at 7 to 10 days notice.
My father had lain down under the load and noted one draft for non-acceptance. I enclose to Col. Butler to look over and hand to you a memo of your acct. to date. You will observe that I have consolidated your two accts. by paying into your business acct. the dividends, etc., I had collected. Bal. to your Dr. $63,716.72. You have, as you will see by referring to this and my previous accts., been credited with cash and charges of every description, including 12% prem. on $60,000, gold, on the merchandise assumed by Government. The profits on this merchandise, after paying these various charges, at present stand in my hands as agent for the Government,
and I should be glad to be relieved of its custody. The dept. is, however, in no apparent hurry for a settlement, and I shall not propose making one until you are ready. I enclose you a copy of your letter to me of June 1st, which I think will convince you of the injustice of the tone taken in your letter of --. Unless words are to be used to conceal wishes, I can not conceive any other interpretation than the one I acted upon when I went to Washington, and simply asked Mr. Stanton and Genl. Meigs to take their choice. Furthermore, I can assure you, it required all my efforts and the strongest assurances of Fox and Mr. Hooper as to my character and position, to prevent your shipments being served as those by the ""Black Prince"" from Ship Island were. Your drafts would have had to take care of themselves but for my urgent and peremptory insisting that I would accept neither Q. M. receipts nor vouchers for the merchandise, and nothing but the fullest agency in the disposal of the property.
The prices of mdse. seem very low today; they were enormous at the time, and pay a very large profit on the cash. You will observe the auctioneer's commission charged at 2½%, this is the rate always charged the U. S. Should the business be decided within reasonable time to belong to you, the charge will be 1%, and the difference will be refunded. The auctioneers, H. Harris & Co., are the best and wealthiest auction house in Boston, and their skill and character is quite sufficient assurance (when backed by their acct. sales) that you have not been ""wronged"" in the disposition of the mdse. You see I rather harp on that word, though I do not believe you meant to apply it to me.
I must tell you a good story of Lunt, though a long one. My uncle, I. S. Fay, my father, and myself have supported the Courier through the summer for the sake of having a paper professing our principles kept afloat. It has cost us about $500.00 apiece. A few days since, my uncle sent Lunt an article calling for the most energetic support for you at New Orleans, which Lunt refused to print. A day or two after he copied from a New York paper a paragraph rather ridiculing you, upon which my father wrote a remonstrance (for publication) squashing the paragraph and appealing to Lunt not to publish and lend sanction to such stuff. Lunt answered very shortly and impertinently in the third person, declining to publish the article, or to be dictated to in his choice of matter for his paper. I cannot do better than give
my father's answer verbatim: ""The Editor of the Boston Courier's note is rec'd. Mr. Fay has filed it with some other documents in his handwriting, and docketted it ‘a new way to pay old debts.’""
We are waiting with intense interest for news from Maryland. Newspaper correspondents have been driven away, and there has been no definite news from either army for three days. How I wish we were back at the old place. By every rule of strategy the enemy has made a very bad move, and ought never to get back into Virginia. But in this war no rules hold, and their dash and celerity may be too much for us again.
Sincerely yours, Rich. S. Fay, Jr.
By the way, you signed your draft for $50,000, Maj. Genl. etc. I have no funds of yours in that capacity. Please confirm it as ""individual"" by letter."

Brig. Genl. M. C. Meigs, Quartermaster General
General: It will be absolutely essential for the operation of this Department this Autumn and for the safety of the city, if we are to be attacked through the Lake, that we have two or three light-draught steamers fitted out to go outside in the sea if necessary, and sufficiently shallow to run up the Bayous. Besides their capability for carrying troops, they should carry some guns as a protection, with canister, against the ambush of Guerillas in the canebreak, and to protect landing. If you will cast your eye upon the map of the part of Louisiana west of the river, and so down the coast, you will see the perfect network of bayous, lakes, rivers, and inlets which cover the country and render every part accessible by water, indeed in no other way. Now, all these bayous have this remarkable condition in common; at the mouth of each is a bar, leaving but 4 or 5 feet deep of water, while inside there will be ten to thirty feet.
To meet this state of facts (the Navy has no boat that draws less than 7 feet when loaded, so that they are useless for service), I have taken two steamers (river), and am so altering and strengthening them for service desired. They will draw when loaded about 4 feet of water, and I shall come then with power enough to resist any Guerilla attack. The
expense with new boilers for one will be in the neighborhood of twelve thousand dollars.
There is another difficulty under which we labor; these are high pressure boats, which advertise their approach three miles, so that it is impossible to capture anybody or to get any supplies that can be moved or got out of the way.
I desire, therefore, a light-draught, low pressure boat that can burn hard coal. Such a one I find here in the ""Nassau,"" and if she is suitable in other respects I desire authority to purchase her. I shall take her until I get a return from this note, and endeavor to do so with privilege of buying, deducting her use.
The exigencies of public service in my judgment clearly call for the expenditure. She will cost in the neighborhood of $40,000, less, perhaps. Any delay with the necessary alterations will embarrass it much. An early answer is requested. I have the honor to be

It is painful to address a brother on a brother's wrongful acts. I felt it my duty to make a pretty severe example of Philip Walden. He was the head and front of the robbery of the U. S. at the New Orleans Custom House. He furnished both brains and knowledge to guide the acts of imbeciles. Born a northern man, in the employment of our Government,
he betrayed his birth, his education, his country, exhibited ingratitude, and plundered her property at the same time, and when called on by me he refused to give information by which the country might recover some portion of the plunder, apparently relying in his northern relation for protection. I have sent him to Fort Jackson at hard labor, because I see no reason why his country shall support his idleness. I feel that if I have erred at all towards him it has been in leniency.
The Collector of the Port will give you in detail, if you will apply to him, the mischief he has caused.

As there has been some rivalry of feeling, I do not think that it would be best to detail a Court from the Officers of the Regiment at Baton Rouge.

Translation. New Orleans, Sept. 16th, 1862
Major General Butler, Commanding Dept. of the Gulf
Sir: I do not intend to make any claim against your General Orders No. 71, concerning foreign subjects; it is evident that order is one of those authorized by the public safety and the present circumstances. However, allow me to tell you that it seems to me not practical, on account of the short time you grant and the enormous number of French residents here; for my part it would be impossible for me to deliver to the thousands of French citizens here the required certificates in the time allowed. The French law does not require of French subjects in foreign countries to have their names registered on the books of the French Consulates, -- they may be away any length of time, still they remain French subjects unless there is proof to the contrary; the protection of France covers them everywhere and always, and that protection can never
be refused as long as they retain their citizenship. Especially in this country of liberty and justice, where the foreigner had so seldom occasion to make use of his nationality, the French in the South as well as in the North of the United States never thought it necessary to be inscribed on the Consular books; before this impious war, the register of the Consulate had 50 names, now it contains from 300 to 400. Now, from this number there is a great distance to 15000, and I must repeat it is impossible for me to do my part of the duty you call for in Order No. 71.
Neither do I understand at all the reason why the time to comply with this order runs out on the day when the Confiscation Act begins, although the latter concerns only the American & adopted citizens, and you can without trouble find out the names of those on the public registers.
If, therefore, General, you think it necessary to have your order carried out, I wish you would give me more time, that I may be able to satisfy all the French subjects in this city, and for those who have yet papers in their possession, as passports, certificates of birth, etc., to take those papers as certificates of their nationality.
Allow me in the same time to call your attention on the oath of allegiance forced upon the foreigner who may be obliged to claim of the authorities, either a right or some favor. Although the forms of the two oaths have been sufficiently established in your orders No. 40 & 41, still I believe you will understand, as I do, the moral impossibility of the first and the legal impossibility of the second, although at some other time the latter has been accepted by certain officers of the militia in order to let them remain neutrals, and to serve only in such capacity as you have seen yourself at the time of your entrance into this city. I should be happy, Genl., if taking notice of my remarks, you would consent to abolish any kind of oath from foreigners, or to modify it in such a manner that it will really be one of honest neutral foreigners.

Maj. Gen. Butler, Comd'g Dept. of the Gulf
Sir: The 23rd of Sept. is rapidly approaching. My position, and that of the directory of this Bank, is one of very great embarrassment, representing as we do large interests both North and South (the former you will have seen by the list of New York Stockholders furnished you), and fear that any voluntary act would jeopardize the coin and securities now within the Confederate lines.
The Mechanics and Traders Bank have, as you are aware, $250,000 in coin in the Confederate lines, $511,000 City Bonds in the hands of the State Auditor, deposited in conformity with law, to secure the redemption of its circulation. The Bank holds $237,720 in bonds or notes of the Confederate States, $336,833 in bonds of the State of Louisiana, and bills or Notes discounted amounting to upwards of $700,000, the payment of which is mainly dependent on parties now in
and adhering to the Confederacy. It is impossible for me to determine what action will be taken by the Confederate authorities, and it would be peculiarly hard that by any act of mine the interest of parties in the United States and Europe, holding stock in this institution, should be rendered liable to seizure and confiscation.
I gave my parole on the 23rd of June in obedience to order No. 13. The oath then administered was of serious import. It has been respected, and will continue to be observed by me, as has every Order emanating from authority since the occupation of the city save the one to which your attention is now called, and which under the circumstances of the case it is hoped will not be enforced. An early answer with your views is desired.

"September 17, 1862","Head Qts. Dept. of the Gulf, New Orleans, Sept. 17th, 1862
Brig. Genl. M. Jeff Thompson, Commanding, etc.
General: Your flag of truce, accrediting Capt. Shaw with a letter and enclosures relating to an exchange of prisoners, was duly entertained yesterday. Your authorities are wholly misinformed upon the subject of those enclosures.
I have never refused the exchange of prisoners paroled or otherwise held. Enclosed find a copy of my Genl. Orders upon this topic, and the orders issuing from the proper officers of my command.
On the contrary, my action has been taken without waiting for an official copy of the General Cartel, which I have not yet received. I have, indeed, applied informally to a bearer of the flag of truce with Mrs. Clark upon the subject.
It would be exceedingly inconvenient and expensive to both parties to transport the prisoners held here and by you
for exchange to Vicksburg. If there is no objection to it, I would propose that the prisoners be delivered at a more convenient point. If an exchange is effected, I would propose to place the prisoners at any point on the lake or river after ten days from date, on a day designated that would be most convenient.
The prisoners held by Gen. Taylor on the West bank can be sent to Donaldsonville or Bonne Carre, or such other point as he may prefer, or Vicksburg. Will you please name a day and place for the exchange as soon as other arrangements are perfected?
May I ask you the favor to send back with my yacht some wounded men which the want or possibility of transportation rendered it indispensable to leave upon the occasion of the late visit of a reconnoitering party to Pontchatoula.
I have sent Lt. Wiegel of my personal staff to receive them, and have allowed Capt. Blount, of the late Actg. Brig. Genl. Allen's Staff, now a prisoner of war here, to go over with your flag in exchange for Capt. Thornton, who is of the same rank and wounded. The other wounded men will be considered in exchange. I have the honor to be,

Brig. Gen. M. Jeff. Thompson, Commdg.
General: In another communication of this date I have proposed to you arrangements of an exchange of prisoners in courteous answer to your note, which I take leave to call attention was written me by your Adjutant General, without the apology of your absence, which I afterwards learned by the captured correspondence between you.
There is, however, a grave difficulty in the way of a general exchange of prisoners so far as this department is concerned. Genl. Taylor, in a letter received this date, of which, from accident, I regret I am not able to give you a copy, has informed me that having captured a hundred and thirty-six of the 8th Vermont Regiment he purposes, upon various pretences set forth in his letter, to except them from the cartel of exchange, and farther threatens, in certain contingencies therein set forth, to take the lives of ten of them by lot. I
send you a copy of my reply to this extraordinary communication.
You will see, General, at once that, consistently with my duty to the men entrusted to my care, I must see to it that not a hair of their heads is touched unjustly or wrongly, while I hope and trust that General Taylor will reconsider his, as it seems to me, ill-judged determination. I shall be under the necessity of holding the prisoners (while) I have to await Genl. Taylor's action in the premises.
That Genl. Taylor may have some personal feeling because of the deprivation of some property upon his plantation, taken by my men, and for the loss of his father's sword, which was found buried for safety under a barn in the city, I can readily understand. But that his ""private griefs"" should incite him to forget his duty as a soldier, and do so great a wrong after full reflection, I shall not believe unless constrained by the fact. Meanwhile I make no threats of retaliation, but deem it my duty to remain in position to protect the lives of my men and the honor of the United States.
When I can be officially assured that all, every one of the men, belonging to the Army of the Gulf, held by Genl. Taylor, or who have been captured from this Army, will be returned in exchange, I will send forward every prisoner of war I hold who desires to be exchanged in accordance with the propositions contained in my communications of this date. I have the honor to be,

"September 17, 1862","Lowell, Sept. 17, '62
Dearest: I must write a little, for a week has passed without sending a letter, and I believe you wish one from home as often as that, if I can write pleasantly; otherwise none at all. I will do the best I can, write when, I, alas, when! I can cease to speak of myself, that is the best and all I can do. Major Bell talks as though he should not go back. Your letter by him says he will return immediately, and that I I must on no consideration think of returning with him. No one here believes that you will be recalled at present. Major Bell thinks there is nothing to keep you there. True, as it is now, but with reinforcements that Department is the most important in the country. If you are recalled, the chances are you will have less power than when you started for Ship Island. What is the reason that Major Bell does not intend to return? Is there no other but that he thinks you will come home?
Judge Abbott met Webster the other day, and asked him if it were possible that you had sent for Griffin to take the place of a man like Bell. He thought you could not have a worse man about you, reckless and unprincipled, with just ability enough to be dangerous. He wondered that Hildreth was not with you, a man true as steel to his friends, and whose judgment and truth were undoubted. I wrote you this to show you the opinion of one man, though you do not think him your friend, of Mr. Griffin. You may have reasons for wanting him, as he belongs to the Abolition party, that others have not thought of, but no such man as he is to be compared to Bell. I write what he said about Fisher only to finish his conversation. I have learned well enough how repugnant he is to you, and that he can only be of use through other persons. One other reason why I write of Griffin is that there are several other men who report that you have sent for them, and are on the point of starting. Dean has gone, Farrington, Eastman, Clemence, etc. The first one was never your friend. The others are auctioneers. Good for their business, but just
as well if somebody else had sent for them. Clemence sent word this morning that he should go in a fortnight, and would like me to go with him. But I have strict orders not to go. I could not take that voyage if you do not want me to go. As I have no expectation you are coming home, I wait with doubt and impatience for your next letter. I have seen Capt. George but three times I think since my return. Fisher, too, has been away most of the time. I sent for Fisher yesterday to come and see me; he has just returned from New York and will take the children back to Washington tomorrow. Blanche is not well today, or they would have started this afternoon. I told Fisher I would like to see Capt. George and hear what he had to say these days. He said it was not much use. He thought George had no heart to think and plan, that he, George, said no matter what was done, there would always be Jackson raised just above you, a spectacle for public comment ready to topple you down as fast as others could build; that you did not see it, and if you did you were reckless about it, and would always have him with you or ready to spring forward and grasp the power that others had helped to raise to the disgust of all who felt any interest. I know how vexed he would be if he knew I wrote this. But no one will tell you anything of this kind but me, and I know it will do no good, and had better be silent and write nothing.

Sir: I have the honor to acknowledge the receipt of your communication of September 2, inclosing copies of several communications addressed by the Department of State to the diplomatic representatives of Great Britain, France, and the Netherlands, growing out of the relations between the military authorities and the consuls of those countries at New Orleans. I have advised M. Conturié, the consul of the Netherlands, that the $800,000 in coin taken from his possession by General Butler, would be restored to him or to the agent of Messrs.

I shall endeavor in my intercourse with the foreign consuls in New Orleans, as far as possible, to avoid any causes of irritation tending to embarrass the Government in its relations to foreign powers.

"September 19, 1862","Headquarters Department of the Gulf, New Orleans, Sept. 19th, 1862
Hon. Wm. H. Seward, Secretary of State
Sir: I have the honor to report to you the following facts:
C. McDonald Fago, a British subject, resident many years in New Orleans, is about to make claim to the property of
Wright & Allen in New Orleans, which has been taken possession of by the U. S. authorities here under the following state of facts.
Wright & Allen are Cotton brokers who claim to have property outside of New Orleans of two millions of dollars. They are most rabid rebels, and were of those who published a card advising the planters not to send forward their crops of cotton for the purpose of inducing foreign intervention.
Soon after we came here, they mortgaged their real Estate here, consisting of a house, for $60,000, to planters in the state of Arkansas, and there sold the equity, together with their furniture for, $5,000 to Mr. Fago, paying about four thousand five hundred dollars per annum interest on the property and to receive nothing. His only payment, however, was by his own note in twelve months, which was sent to their friend the planter in Arkansas.
Wright & Allen were then openly boasting that they would not take the oath of allegiance to the United States, and were encouraging others to refuse and stand by Secession. In order to divest themselves of the last vestige of visible property upon which the confiscation act could take effect, having given to the widow of their deceased partner, an Irish woman, a note or notes for three thousand dollars, they then sell her their plate for that amount, and then have it shipped under another name to Liverpool.
A large number of others are following their examples, and, indeed, all the property of New Orleans is changing hands into foreigners and women, to avoid the consequences of the confiscation acts.
Believing all this to be intolerable, I have resolved to make this a test case, and have seized this property, and intend to hold it where it is until the matter can be submitted to the Courts.
Mr. Fago has sent to Washington to have this property given up as a test case. If the course of authority here is interfered with in this case, it will be next to impossible to maintain order in this city. This Mr. Fago has first had a large amount of sugar belonging to his brother, an aid to Governor Moore, given up to him by the decision of Reverdy Johnson. Emboldened by this experiment, he proposes to try once more. If successful, I should prefer that the Government would get some one else to hold New Orleans instead of myself. Indeed, Sir, I beg leave to add that another such
Commissioner as Mr. Johnson sent here would render the city untenable. The town got itself into such a state, while Mr. Johnson was here, that he confessed to me that he could hardly sleep from nervousness from fear of a rising, and hurried away, hardly completing his work, as soon as he heard Baton Rouge was about to be attacked.
The result of his mission here has caused it to be understood that I am not supported by the Government, that I am soon to be relieved, that all my acts are to be overhauled, and that a rebel may do anything he pleases in the city, as the worst may be a few days imprisonment, when my successor will come and he will be released.
To such an extent has this thing gone that inmates of the Parish prison, sent there for grand larceny, robbery, etc., in humble imitation of the foreign consuls have agreed together to send an agent to Washington to ask for a Government Commission to investigate charges made by these thieves against the Provost Marshal, by whose vigilance they were detected.
Alexander the Coppersmith, by his cry ""Great is Diana of the Ephesians, the institution of slavery is in danger,"" did me much harm in Louisiana, from the effects of which I am just recovering, and the only fear I now have is that, if the last accounts are true, Mr. Johnson will have so much more nervous apprehension for his personal safety in Baltimore than he had in New Orleans, that he will want to come back here, now the yellow fever season is over, as to a place of security.
I have done myself the honor to make this detail of the case at length to the State Department, so that all the facts are before it upon which I act. The inferences from those facts must, from the nature of testimony, be left to my judgment until the Courts can act authoritatively in the matter.
Another reason why I have detailed these facts with such minuteness is that in the reports of Mr. Johnson furnished to the Consuls to be read here, every fact is suppressed which would form a shadow of justification for my acts, and ex parte affidavits, (by those) accused by me of a fraudulent transfer of large amounts of property, are the sole basis of the report.
True, by that report more than three-quarters of a million of specie is placed in the hands of one Forstall, a rebel, a leading member of the ""Southern Independent Association,"" a league wherein each member bound himself by a horrid and impious
oath ""to resist unto death itself all attempts to restore the Union."" A confrére of Soulé in the Committee of the City which destroyed more than ten millions of property by fire, to prevent its coming into the hands of the United States authorities, when the fleet passed the forts.
I beg of you, Sir, to consider that I mention the character of this report, not in any tone of complaint of the State Department. If it is necessary to suppress facts to impugn the motives and disown the acts of a Commanding Officer of the Army in the field, or to publish to those plotting the destruction of the Republic, that he has had all control of public affairs in New Orleans taken from him and transferred to a subordinate, because of the harshness of his administration, as was done in the despatch to the Minister of the Netherlands, even if the facts is not true, I bow to the mandate of ""State Necessity"" without a murmur. I have made larger sacrifices than this for my country, and am prepared for still greater if need be, but I only wish to make them when they will be useful, and therefore have pointed the effect of the Commission Report and despatch upon a turbulent, rebellious, uneasy, excitable, vindictive, brutalised, half-foreign population, made mad by exaggerated reports of the victories of their fellows, the fall of the National Capitol, the invasion of the North, and excited to insubordination by the double hope that either by the success of the arms of their brethren, or the interference of the National Executive in their behalf, they shall soon be released from the Government which has ever held the city in quiet order or unplundering peace. Awaiting instructions, I have the honor to be,
Your obedient Servant,

My object was to see you in behalf of the Prussian ship ""Essex,"" and I have now the honor to address you on the same subject.
On the 16th inst. the master of the ""Essex"" applied at the Custom House for a clearance, which was refused him, at first without assigning any reason; but subsequently, on my addressing a note to the Collector, Captain Klatt of the above-named vessel was informed that his vessel was detained on account of several packages of plate and specie which were shipped on board of her.
The ""Essex"" took in cargo on a general permit, and I do not see that by her receiving on board said plate and specie the revenue laws of the United States, nor the more recent regulations governing the intercourse of foreign vessels with this port, nor any of your own orders, issued up to the 16th inst., have been infringed, but nevertheless the ""Essex"" has now been detained three days at a considerable expense.
I take the liberty now, General, to request you to allow the ""Essex"" to obtain her clearance without further delay, or otherwise to inform me of the cause of the difficulty, so that I may take steps to aid in removing it if possible. I remain, General, With much respect,

My dear Sarah: I write by the ""Matanzas"" which sails this morning. There is on board of her a box containing photographs, which I trust will arrive safe. The ""Saxon"" came yesterday. Her cargo is not worth the freight. Everything remains quiet here save the excitement about the Confiscation Act, which goes into effect in three days. The ""ladies"" of New Orleans are in great trouble now about their property, and taking the oath. They literally swarm upon me. The health of the city remains admirable. We have had one case of yellow fever about two weeks ago, a passenger that slipped by the quarantine. Such sanitary measures were taken, however, as to check its spread. We have had no other. Everybody well that you know, and all the command getting well.
I have raised two regiments of the ""chosen people of colour,"" as Genl. Jackson terms them. Genl. Sherman is here, and has taken Phelps' place. General Arnold is here also from Pensacola, Gen. Weitzel, Shepley, and Dow, so you see I have Brig. Generals enough.
Tell Fisher to write me how he has received sugar, and if in funds. I may want to draw on him for 150 thousand dollars.
Fisher must not think of coming out here at present. There is too much for him to do at home. The oats are not worth the freight. They have been too long on the way. However, I should keep them awhile.
Your letter containing photographs was received. I re-enclose it, and will wait for the pictures. You seem to take pride in the fact that yours is the saddest face ever seen. Why do so? Why not the gayest -- the happiest? It is a poor compliment to a live husband and a family of lovely children that a wife has a sadder face than a specimen widow. From that face one would think that I treated you like a brute, that your children were ungrateful, your home cheerless and gloomy your relatives had deserted you, and that even peace of conscience was denied you. Why then express the very contrary of all the facts which surround you? It does not add to your own happiness because I never supposed you were a person who made a luxury of woe. Why then so sad? You have much if not everything to make you happy. Come now, put on a cheerful face, smile and come down here, and make me happy with the merriest face that ever was seen. Why does not that ""little puss"" Blanche write me?
How shockingly everything has gone on in Virginia. How it is going on, I know not now. The Government don't seem to have the energy and determination of mice. However, I must criticize only to you. Seward has played me a scurvy trick by writing to the Consuls that Genl. Shepley was appointed Military Governor here because of displeasure of my ""harshness"" here.

In your note addressed to me on the 19th inst., receipt of which I have the honor to acknowledge herewith, the said packages are declared to be contraband, and [in] this connection I would beg leave to observe that by the sixth section of the Confiscation Act, they would only become such after the 23d, or perhaps have become such after the 18th, by the operation of your general order No. 73. [There] existed, therefore, on the 15th inst., no cause for the detention of the ""Essex.""
I have now herewith to hand you the protest entered by Captain Klatt against the detention of his vessel, and of which I shall also forward a copy to the Prussian Minister at Washington.
The ""Essex"" is at great daily expense. She claims damages to the extent of $500 in gold per diem, and it is therefore of importance to bring this question to an issue either in one way or another, and begging that you will give it your early consideration, I remain, General,
Very respectfully, Your obdt. servt.,
J. Kruttschnidt, Acting Consul of Prussia
P. S: Captain Klatt requests me to state that he wishes it to be distinctly understood that the non-compliance on his part with your order should only be attributed to his desire to guard himself against difficulties in Liverpool, and to no other motive.

To the Prussian Consul, New Orleans
Sir: I have received yours of the 23rd, containing protest.
The ship ""Essex"" has been at liberty to depart since the date of the Collector's letter to you. If the Captain choose to lay here longer, he does it at his own risk and expense.
I suppose it is within the province of a military Commander to determine for himself, and upon his own responsibility, what he may judge the necessity of his position will allow to be shipped from the port under his command. I have
exercised that discretion, and I do not require any interpretation of my orders from the Acting Prussian Consul to govern my action.
I take leave to call your attention that the only Prussian Consul accredited here is in command of rebel forces in the field, while his wife remains in this jurisdiction.
While I have endeavored and shall endeavor to interfere as little as possible with any acts, either of commerce of your countrymen or official acts of yourself, as I have endeavored to extend to you every courtesy, I am not a little surprised at your action in regard to ship ""Essex."" I shall not use force to take the obnoxious packages out of the ""Essex"" because I believe that very force would be made a subject of complaint, but I repeat what I have already said, until the master of the ""Essex"" deliver these packages to the Customhouse officer, the ship cannot sail, and if she remains, as he is now doing, it must be at his own risk and peril.

Dearest: I received your letters yesterday by Mr. Bonfanti. He called in the afternoon to deliver them, and came again to pass the evening. Mr. Webster and his wife happened to be here, and Mr. Morse had met the gentleman in the cars, and called to see him in the evening. I gave them coffee and fruits, brandy, and cigars; while they were at the latter left them alone. During this time Mr. Bonfanti said some things
to Mr. Webster that I will write you, though I had thought to leave this subject alone. In your letter to me you write of being recalled; this I expected, but not yet. While there is danger of an attack, as it is believed there is, you will be retained. When that danger is over, I think you will be superseded. There are several reasons why I have expected this, some of them I have written to you during the summer, they were not likely to make a change while the climate was obnoxious. There may be some difficulty in the way even now that will prevent it, for you are much thought of; but the chances are you will be recalled and sent somewhere else. This gentleman said to Webster and Morse that there was something he would like to say to Mrs. Butler, or have said to her, that she might write it to the Gen'l. He would like to have spoken to you about it, but as he was situated did not feel at liberty to do so while he was with you. He says that Col. Butler has done, and is doing you vast injury, that he is utterly hated, and all his deeds are reflected on you. He is willing his name should be used in the communication, as he greatly likes you, and does not like to see you injured from such a cause, without at least your being made aware of it. All these things I have heard here, from Boston men and merchants through the summer, of the fact I was well assured before I left New Orleans, that he is of vital injury to you. And that you cannot stand under that burden there, though it overwhelms you in a different form, any better than you could at Fortress Monroe. A more obnoxious person to invest with power could not be found. The Government will never leave him there, to deal with the Confiscation Act. I know you will say this is prejudice and ill-feeling on my part. I cannot help it. I write my own convictions and the words of others. You think you control him and know his acts. On the contrary, though subservient to your face, he controls where he wishes, insults and overbears everywhere. This subject does not trouble me personally as it has done, and if you now concluded to live together hereafter. I think I should not much mind it. All that I can suffer these two years have exhausted. It is only a question how far you are willing to suffer in estimation and position for his advancement. If you are satisfied, let others wince, -- it is no great matter. I would not have you now alter one thing from mere regard to my wishes.
Your coming home will give me so much pleasure we shall never think of quarreling with the reasons, be they ever so
unjust. Mr. Bonfanti says you are looking very well and in excellent spirits. He thinks there will be no attack made on the city. Is it not rather imprudent to go out alone after dark? I think I would not run that risk; a man stabbed in the night is but a sorry object. I felt compelled to write what this man said, but I am in no mood for writing, but in any mood I am
Always affectionately, yours, Sarah"
"September, 1862","Lowell, Sept. '62
Dearest: I must write a little this afternoon, though I sent you a letter this morning. Capt. George has just called on his way to New York to look after the unfortunate vessel with Fisher, who is now there, that was freighted for New Orleans. He is full of suggestion as usual, but only a minute of time. He thinks you had better not come north without asking leave of the President, that there is no place so important as the one you now hold in the estimation of the country, hardly second to Washington, and on no account to make any move that will risk your withdrawal from that Department, there are enough ready to spring into it. Yet if you could come to Washington and plead your own cause for reinforcements, you would have great influence. But that you cannot do while the town is threatened. Halleck, as you know, is appointed Secretary of War. McClellan is reinstated as Commander-in-Chief on the Potomac. You know how friendly they are likely to be to you. George has not altered his mind, and says there is but one man who has the power and will to aid you, and the last he fears you have lost by neglect. I do not think so, for the person he means is troubled, and would like an ally, if he could find one on whom he could firmly rely. And he likes you. Pope goes to the North West. Washington is panic-stricken, and is so afflicted, every few months, the only man who has steadily pursued one course is the one I speak of. George says this is a crisis, and you ought not to move much until it is over. Be content and glad to be still. Hundreds among the middling people about Washington say if you were leader we should not be in the condition we are now. But see you not, you want a firm friend, who is in power. The regulars are holding most of the power, but they prefer their own. You must look for aid elsewhere. Your Department is second only to McClellan's. I should prefer your
position. You may partly succeed in getting reinforcements through the influence of the regular officers in your command. George says it would be very well to cultivate Gen'l. Sherman thoroughly, that he is an able officer, very able, whether successful or not heretofore, and that you will find him all you desire. About your arming the free blacks there is a little question. A few who are disposed to find fault say you are doing the same thing for which Phelps was withdrawn. George Pearson says you will find them treacherous. Major Bell informs me they are as white as any person, and that he has a great mind to write a little article to that effect. But it would be better it should be editorial, if it's done at all. I will tell him so when I see him. George says the country is in too terrible a struggle to mind anything about it. Clemence, I hear, is going out to you. He has said some ill-natured things. I am sorry you asked him to go, but no matter; he will serve you while it answers his interest. Treat him well, but do not trust him deeply. He is selfish and envious. As soon as this vessel is repaired, she will be sent to New Orleans. She was built for a tug-boat, and perhaps is just what you want. (I shall never remember to ask the name!) If so you will be glad of her arrival. George says you ought to have the ""Saxon"" with two or three guns mounted ready for your own use; that nothing would tempt him to stay in such a town without a vessel of that sort. I am writing you what he says, because you have sometimes thought his suggestions good. He further says the wisest thing a man can do, who has any means afloat, is to convert it into gold, and never let go of it till this war is over. I have written part of this letter almost in the dark. I write very rapidly of late, and no longer think how it looks. By the time this is sent away I shall think, ah! I forgot to write so and so, and have to begin again. In this letter I have not so far said one word of home, children, of what we are doing or thinking. But I think of you always, and write this today that you may get the views of others to compare with your own, and work them into use if they are worth it. The children are well. Everything looks fresh -- the peaches and pears are ripe. If you were here to eat them I should be happy. But I shall see you soon either here or there.
Yours, Sarah
The pineapple plants arrived today, looking very well. The gardener says they require seventy degrees of heat in winter.

My dear Wife: Who shall say I do not take pains to write you; here I have tumbled out of bed at reveille to send this note by the mail to say I am in good health, except the before mentioned ""sore boils and prickly heat.""
The ""Saxon"" has got here after a 26 days passage. We are expecting a new mail in this morning. We are without news since the 6th. We have instead the most extravagant rumors, but we are used to them. Bell has not got back yet, and Kinsman, who took his place as Provost Judge, has worked himself quite sick. Strong is well. I have not got the pictures yet.
Today is the last day before the Confiscation Act goes into effect. The oath of allegiance has been taken by almost everybody in the city -- they have taken it to save their property, but with very wry faces. The women have all had to ""come up to the scratch."" Elegant phrase, that last, isn't it? I am called -- time is up. The mail must go, so a thousand kisses, a hundred embraces, one hug like a bear to you.

"September 23, 1862","Treasury Department, Sept. 23, 1862
My dear General: I am delighted by your great success at New Orleans. You know, of course, that all I can do to promote it will be most gladly done. Happily you are less oppressive in your demands on the Treasury than any other of our Generals in important positions. I wish you could have men enough to move up the Mississippi and clear it out. What a crown to your achievements that would be!
When General Halleck came here the President requested him to call on me about the financial measures necessary to the prosecution of the War. I told him that the most important in my judgment were, 1st, the substitution of an active, energetic, fearless general for McClellan in the command of the Army of the Potomac, then stranded on James River, and 2nd, the opening of the Mississippi. Another, less vitally important financially, seemed to me equally important politically
and militarily, -- that was the prompt advance of Buel's Army into East Tennessee. The first was not done; the second was not done; the third was not done; and today the Treasury is almost thirty-six millions behind, and almost without resources, except Treasury notes of which the faculty to issue only fifty-six millions remains, and customs which supply about $200,000 per day. The bonds on which our chief reliance most necessarily be placed the 5-20 sixes cannot be negotiated.
But we have something else -- defeat before Washington poorly compensated by the expulsion of the rebels from Maryland; Ohio and Indiana menaced; military stagnation throughout the South with danger of expulsion from the points gained on the Atlantic Coast: Tennessee nearly lost and Kentucky nearly over run. Was there ever anything like it?
Mr. Denison writes me in your praise. He says your administration is eminently successful and that you are getting on admirably with your free colored regiments; enlisting without much enquiry into the status prior to enlistment. This is well. You must anticipate a little the operation of the Proclamation in New Orleans and Louisiana. The law frees all slaves of rebels in any city occupied by our troops and previously occupied by rebels. This is the condition of New Orleans. Is it not clear, then, that the presumption of freedom is in favor of every man only to be set aside in case of some by clear proof of continuous loyalty?
Yours faithfully, S. P. Chase"

General: Having been informed that a small force of the enemy were repairing Manchac Pass, and that the troops had been withdrawn from Pontchatoula, 48 miles north of the city, the Headquarters of Jefferson Thompson, I directed Major Strong, my Chief of Staff, to take five companies of men to complete the destruction of the bridge and the repairs, if any, and by a' division of his forces endeavor to secure the person of General Thompson and to destroy his supplies.
Owing to the heavy draught of water of our boast, as set forth in Major Strong's report herewith enclosed, it was found impossible to carry the plan as originally proposed.
But Major Strong, not to be baffled, determined upon an attack, and in open day at the head of 112 men made a march of ten miles upon the Headquarters of a General who was collecting forces to attack New Orleans, drove away a light battery of artillery supported by 300 infantry, took and occupied the town, destroyed the telegraph and Post Office, captured the despatches, possessed himself of the General's presentation sword, spurs, and bridle as trophies (our officers do not plunder Generals' Quarters of shirts and stockings), burned his supply train of twenty cars, and returned at his leisure, inflicting treble loss upon the enemy in killed and wounded.
I beg to commend this to the Commanding General as one of the most daring and successful exploits of the war, equal in dash, spirit, and cool courage to anything attempted on any side. Major Strong and his officers and men deserve great credit. It may have been a little daring, perhaps rash, but that has not been an epidemic fault with our Officers. I have the honor to be,

Dearest: Major Bell came today with his wife and Capt. Clark. They sail for New Orleans on Saturday. Major Bell must have said he would not return because he expected you
home. There is now no thought of removing you. I think you will get reinforcements and finish your work in the Gulf. Their call today was very pleasant. They could not stay for dinner, but I gave them a very nice lunch. I wrote you a long letter yesterday that I intended to send by Major Bell, but I feared that what I wrote might trouble you, and I shall not send it. I felt a little hurt because you did not seem to care much about my coming. Write me again, and tell me you would not like to be there through the winter without me on your own account; and then I shall feel that you want me. Do not leave me in doubt about this, because the voyage will be so hard, if I think you are a little indifferent about my going. Remember this, and pray attend to it kindly. Blanche left me yesterday for Georgetown again. Fisher waited four days for her though in great haste to get to New York and Baltimore. His vessel is at the last place. She will have to be repaired, and will not be sent to New Orleans. The pictures are all brought back. I shall go to Boston tomorrow to get copies, and will forward them as soon as complete. Blanche was sick for several days. Do not paint the picture of myself that I sent you. It was taken soon after I came back, -- I am not so thin now. I am sorry I sent it, so sad looking as it is, you will not like to see it. Do you not think Blanche's are pretty, the last three I sent you? I have your letters of August 7th, 10th, and 15th, with mine enclosed. Dr. Martin will write you to send for him. Do not do it unless you have already. I am not pleased with him altogether.
The President has issued a Proclamation of Emancipation to take effect next January. There will be some growling, but the people will bear it now. Fisher thinks your course just right, neither too fast or too slow. He was very anxious to see Major Bell before he started, but could not find the time. He thinks Major Bell the most reliable and honorable man you have with you. I hope while you remain in the War he will be with you. Would it not be well to give W -- another place if you could make one for him; for he gives but little help or strength to you, and make an opening for Major Bell. He does not aspire to military fame, but of course would like a regular place on your staff, and a truer friend or better counsellor you can hardly find. Fisher has been to see Carney that if your drafts arrive before the sugar he may be ready to meet them. He asked me how you came to write about his going to N. O., as he had never written to you of doing so. I
told him I had spoken of his going with Peirce. Bonfanti drew on Fay by your order for a hundred thousand more or less. I suppose there can be no mistake about it. Pray write me as often as you can. We cannot but feel dreadfully disappointed that you are not to come home, though it would be disapproval if the Government removed you. I would have gone with Major Bell but for your prohibition. Now I must wait till the equinoctial storm is over. That may be the middle of October, or even later.
Write me often, and pleasantly as you can. You see I am improving, as I would not send you what I wrote yesterday for fear it should grieve you. I hope we may both forbear, till we are of one mind in everything. As we are, I will believe in thinking much of each other. With great desire to see you,

In pursuance of your order No. 76 I will make a faithful return substantially if not minutely correct of all my property here except about $3,000, the greater part of which is in gold, that I have reserved for an emergency. I mention this to you now to avoid misapprehension.
Your order referred to exempts those only who have taken the oath of allegiance, but I cannot think you intended to include those in my situation, as claiming to be enemies of the United States.
Such an interpretation is in my opinion at variance with the act of Congress as well as with the Proclamation of President Lincoln. I have the honor to be, Sir,

Sir: I have your note of the 26th Sept. In my judgment there can be no such thing as neutrality by a citizen of the United States in this contest for the life of the Government -- as an officer he cannot recognize such neutrality. ""He that is not for us is against us.""
All good citizens are called upon to lend their influence to the United States -- all that do not do so are the enemies of the United States. The line is to be distinctly and broadly drawn. Every citizen must find himself on the one side or
the other of that line, and can claim no other position than that of friend or enemy of the United States.
While I am sorry to be obliged to differ from you in your constructions of the act of Congress, and the Proclamation of the President, yet I cannot permit any reservation of property from the list or exception of persons from the requirement of Order No. 76. It may be and I trust is quite true that by no act of yours have you rendered yourself liable to the confiscation of your property under the Act and Proclamation, but that is for the military or other Courts to decide. You, however, will advise yourself with your usual care and caution what may be the effect, now that you are solemnly called upon to declare yourself in favor of the Government by contuniaciously refusing to renew your allegiance to it, thereby inducing from your example others of your fellow-citizens to remain in the same opposition.
I am glad to acknowledge your long and upright life as a man, your former services as an officer of the Government, and the high respect I entertain for your personal character and moral worth; but I am dealing with your duty as a citizen of the United States.
All these noble qualities, as well as your high social position, render your example all the more influential and pernicious, and, I grieve to add, in my opinion more dangerous to the interest of the United States than if, as a younger man, you had shouldered your musket and marched to the field in the Army of the Rebellion.

Dearest: I have been on the sofa nearly all day; not feeling well at all. Yesterday we took the children to Boston to get their pictures and show them the Aquarial Garden. It was very fatiguing, that and the bad smell in the rooms at the Aquarial has made me nearly sick. The children were delighted with the monkeys, fishes, and Commodore Nutt. Major Bell and Capt. Clark are on their way to New Orleans. I ought to be with them. I hope your next letter will show a little more interest about it. It leaves a soreness of feeling when you make but little account of passing the winter without me. But let that pass, you will be glad to see me sometime.
Your friend, that you wrote to Fisher you would like to
have a long chat with, was here on Friday. I will endeavor to give you the conversation and his views of your present position and prospects. I think your position satisfactory, and would not venture dangerous experiments. The Secretary of War pushed it to an issue. Halleck refused to obey the order, and the President decided he must not be interfered with. Stanton submitted and kept his place. McClellan has been deposed only to be reinstated with stronger power, and propped securely with Halleck. The President was obliged to yield this or the rebels might have taken Washington. Pope was defeated, if his report is true, because other Generals neglected to reinforce him where he had full right to expect it. He is driven into exile, and disgraced, while McClellan is reinstated. It is said privately that some of the Generals of the Potomac waited on the President, and informed him there could be no safety for Washington unless McClellan was restored to the command. The President yielded to the pressure. As soon as the rebels were driven out of Maryland, the President issued the Proclamation for Emancipation. (Can anyone tell why they were not broken to pieces, scattered, and captured?) There was but one's day's fighting of any note, and that simply to show how the two opposing leaders could handle their men; it was tolerably warm work for a while, but each was afraid to stake all on the issue; if they had it is more than likely Lee would have pressed us to defeat. Night came on, and Lee with his force recrossed into Virginia. The President's Proclamation of Emancipation was made directly on the heels of this as a concession to the Abolitionists, after restoring McClellan. So far there has been no great demonstration made about it. Those who desire it are in doubt it may prove but a dead letter. All may be quiet on the Potomac for another year for aught that can be done to move them if this Proclamation does not please the Generals, so that the odium is incurred, if there is any attached to it, without the chance of any benefit to arise from it. This has shook Seward's power; the President now leans on Chase. He is the man serenaded. But in spite of this, Seward is so wiry and capable, so much of a statesman, that if anything goes wrong he will get the power again, and be all the stronger for a momentary defeat. McClellan, as you will see, is the military man for the Democratic party. Seymour of New York runs in opposition to Wadsworth for Governor. There is much expectation that he will win. He is also thought of by civilians as a check
to McClellan, in the Democratic party. That would be better for you, as he is a friend of yours. By this you will see that both rings there are filled. In the Republican party, Fremont is the man. A move was made to give him fifty thousand men (He would be in condition then to enforce a great deal). But they were not successful in getting their wants carried out. There is one opening for you, if you would think it advisable to venture on such dangerous ground. I think you have thought something of it, though not perhaps to work through the same avenues it has been suggested to me would be the best. You could write to the President, offering in your Department to carry out his Proclamation according to his wish. His Proclamation incites to insurrection which will lead to fearful horrors. You can offer to organize insurrection, arm the negroes, use them as infantry, and of our soldiers make flying artillery and cavalry, to make a distinction between them and the blacks. To do this you want reinforcements, more staff officers, such as they have perfect confidence in, a Flag Officer who is ready to coöperate with the Fleet, so that if they pour their whole army upon you you may have transportation for your men and assistance from their guns. The Rebels could hardly remain quiet at Richmond if such work was progressing in the South West. The armies both North and South might be obliged to move. If you wish to offer your services to the President to carry out his Proclamation, there are two channels through which it could be done. Pierce is an intimate friend of Charles Sumner. Write what would seem best to you to Sumner and Chase, and a line of endorsement of Pierce as the man who has your confidence. If you are willing to hold by Seward, who will yet get the power again, the man who thinks so highly of him is ready to be your messenger to him, and you could not have a better one. This would give Seward the chance to carry out the President's views, and give him once more the ascendency. Your friend thinks he would assent, and carry it through to the satisfaction of those engaged with him. You know how much your friend admires him, and would rather work with that party than the other. But not unless there is a feeling of perfect confidence and good will between you and Seward, as nothing short of that would answer. Your friend looks upon this as an almost desperate chance, but the only one beyond your present position. If you carry out the abolition views, and build up a power that way, it would place you at the head of
a party, though the powers whose orders you execute might not anticipate or desire such a result. At present you are outside of all parties. And perhaps that is the best and most honorable place you could be in, in a crisis like this when the bitterness of party seems likely to destroy the country. But if you wish to sway or direct the movements of a party, these hints are offered for your deliberation. You can think over what effect a letter from you to the President of the kind suggested would have, and do what you think best when you have well deliberated. For it is a fearful thing to arm these negroes and put them in their master's houses. Nor can there be any certainty they will prove effective as soldiers, or that our people will fight with them. I have received your letter wherein you speak of Mr. Seward and the letter you have sent him. I hope you will not find hereafter that you have acted unwisely. But that closes that side of the question. Your friend will be sorry you are in open opposition, for there is a powerful conservative party in New York that will give him great strength, and he has served you well in times gone by. Is the breach too great to be repaired? Do not widen it more than you can help. But let that go, every man must judge for himself. There may be a natural antagonism on your part, and if so you could never work well together. If you could have held together at this hour, you and he acting in concert could wield immense power. Sumner and Chase, I believe, are agreeable to you. It is not certain the abolition party can prevail. The Democratic party, and all the Military with McClellan at their head, offer a very formidable opposition. If you volunteer in this and fail you lose utterly, and make yourself an object of odium, now and perhaps in time to come. If it should prove successful, you might be regarded as the redeemer of down-trodden humanity. There is but a step sometimes between a crown and a gibbet, and in days like these one cannot tell to which his labours will lead. The papers report the Commissioners of Peace are on their way from the South. Would it were possible. This life of anxiety is wearisome. I do not like to send this until I have seen your friend again, as I cannot be sure I have rightly expressed what was desired. But you will see and easily comprehend what would be of use to you if not clearly expressed, and will act as you judge best after careful deliberation. If you write to the President, ask for an officer to be sent down for the confiscation work in whom they have perfect confidence."

Dearest: Your letters of Sept. 15th and 20th came this morning. How can you write such letters in answer to those I send you! Cold, half-defiant, and leaving a feeling of depression that overpowers me no matter how much I strive against it. If you do not want me, for mercy's sake say so, and do not wound me further. You may not be aware how much the tone of your letters has changed. In every letter I have asked, begged, to know if you wished me to come, and when! After telling me three times not to come, the only permission I have received is this. ""If you can appear so and so I shall be glad to see you."" I shall be as God wills, and circumstances compel, subject to the same feelings as other people. But these are not reasons for or against seeing me, whether I am more or less merry. Be willing to make some effort on your own part to lift the weight that oppresses me, and see if I do not appreciate it. If life looks more inviting in that fair clime without me, say so; your letters have hurt me, I cannot bear it, nor the manner in which you have asked me to come.
I have a long letter, two-thirds written, suggested by your friend George, of what he thinks would be your best, and as he says your only opening for you now to gain a place in the future. He was unwilling to write himself -- it involves such serious consequences. My business is to write you what I hear and leave it to your own discretion how to use it. Soon as I have seen him to know if I have written what he desires, I will send it, or what would give me greater pleasure, take it to you if I felt assured I was truly welcome. I am as always,

"October 1, 1862","Headquarters Department of the Gulf, New Orleans, Oct. 1st, 1862
Hon. E. M. Stanton, Secretary of War
Sir: In obedience to requirement of the Despatch of the Department of the 10th and 18th ultimo, which reached me by the same mail, enclosing communications from Spanish legation (in translation) dated the 28th of June, the 7th and 26th of August, respectively, directing me to report fully to
the department all the facts and circumstances connected with the arrival and departure of the Spanish ship ""Cardenas"" and the U. S. ship ""Roanoke"" at the port of New Orleans in June last, ""and also full explanations of the complaints involved in the communications of the Spanish Consul and others of the administration of the Quarantine laws of this department,"" I beg leave to submit the history of such administration, and especially in regard to the ""Cardenas"" and ""Roanoke,"" ""Pinta"" and ""Marie Galante.""
Let me premise, however, that the question so far as these vessels or any others are concerned, except for the purpose of reclamation and complaint, have long ceased to be of practical importance, as the ""Cardenas"" has made one trip to Cuba and back since the occurrence complained of, and the ""Pinta"" and ""Marie Galante,"" Spanish transports for tobacco, have loaded and gone home, I had supposed entirely satisfied with their treatment at this point.
When New Orleans was captured it was found in the utmost possible filthy condition, because of the troublesome times. The contractors upon all the streets and canals had utterly neglected to comply with their contracts for cleaning and purifying the streets, and the filth was indescribable.
In view of this most alarming sanitary condition of the city and the approach of the epidemic season, after consultation with the most eminent local physicians, who would give their advice, some refusing to give an opinion with an apparent hope ""that the pestilence would do what their rebel arms would not do -- drive us out,"" and acting with the advice of my medical staff, I took the most energetic measures to purify the city itself from all possibility of engendering disease. Believing at the same time that the yellow fever was no more indigenous to New Orleans than the sugar cane, but must be imported or propagated as that is by cuttings, and that a firmly administered Quarantine, guided by science and honesty of purpose, discriminating as regards cargoes and cleanliness of ships, would effectually keep out the scourge of the city prayed for as Ally of the rebellion, I ordered Quarantine to be enforced with these discriminations -- not a ""procrustean period of Quarantine to all"" -- a vessel loaded with hides and wool, the absorbents of the malaria with a filthy hold, reeking with dead and putrid organic matter, loaded at an infected port, infected hands, sown thick with the seeds of disease, only waiting for time and the warm sun to develop
them into a plague, was not put on equality as to time with a steamer for passengers, kept clean and sweet as a mercantile necessity to procure business, laden with flour, tight casks of salted provisions and round shot and shell which would not be likely either to absorb or generate contagion.
Again, the length of time which a ship and cargo had been exposed to the danger of the contagion had much to do with the Quarantine. A ship belonging in an infected port, loaded there, her cargo either the product or the manufacture of that port, her crew acclimated and therefore indifferent to sanitary regulations and appliances, required to be kept under Quarantine longer to watch the probable development of the disease and to await the operation of purification, than a vessel loaded at a northern port, where the frost insured health in this regard, and which had merely touched at a port inflicted with yellow fever, and held communication with the shore under the restriction imposed by fears of unacclimated Officers and crew.
These and kindred considerations, which will readily suggest themselves to your mind, were the controlling guide to the very intelligent medical officers who were in charge at Quarantine, as they were to report upon the necessity and length of detention of vessels. We, however, always determined to err, if at all, upon the safe side, holding ever the far greater importance of the lives of a great city and an army committed to our charge, than the possible danger of any commercial adventure from detention.
I need not assure you, Sir, that the questions of ""Nationality"" never entered into our thought in the exercise of our judgment and power except in one possible relation.
We could not help looking with a little less care to and holding under advisement a little less time a vessel of a Nation proverbial for the neatness of their ships and goods as compared with one who enjoys an unenviable reputation the other way. With these and upon these bases have the Quarantine and health laws been administered at New Orleans up to the first day of October.
I can point with a reasonably justified pride to the result as an explanation and a vindication of my acts and administration in this particular. Pardon me if I add that I claim for this triumph of science, integrity, firmness, and skill of my medical staff, by which thousands of lives have been saved, and by far the most dreaded foe driven from the city of New
Orleans, as much credit as if by the disposition of my troops we had won a victory over the less deadly but hardly less implacable enemy in a conflict of arms.
Up to this date there have been no malignant or epidemic or virulent fevers or disease in New Orleans, and its mortality returns show it to be the most healthy city in the United States. In one regiment, the 13th Conn., a thousand strong, quartered in the Custom House since the 15th of May, but one man was lost during the months July and August.
His Excellency, Mr. Tarsara, the Spanish Minister, is most grievously misinformed when he says to the Secretary of State that the salubrity of New Orleans is no better than that of the Island of Cuba. Our Quarantine has been more perfect than Blockade. We have had serious cases of fever at the Quarantine only 75 miles from us, and but a single one at New Orleans, and this one at once justifies and illustrates our sanitary regulations.
The U. S. Steamship ""Ida,"" having touched at Nassau only, and no disease having been reported as existing there at the time of her departure, she was permitted to pass up by the health officers after fumigation and other precautions. The day after her arrival in the city one of her passengers on shore was taken sick and on the sixth day died, an unmistakable case of malignant yellow fever. The most stringent measures were taken to isolate the disease. Everything that touched or was about the deceased was buried, acclimated persons only were allowed to do the sad offices. The house in which he died was most thoroughly purified, and by the blessing of ""Him who holdeth all in the hollow of his hand"" the pestilence was stayed.
The steamer was ordered at once below where she is undergoing Quarantine. Even while I write this the English Consul reports the British Brig ""Volunteer"" to me at the mouth of the river out of provisions, her officer on board with medical supplies and other aid.
I have thus given to the Department a full explanation of the ""complaint"" involved in my administration of the Quarantine laws. Upon the other branches of the inquiry relative to Spanish steamer ""Cardenas,"" I am most happy to report.
As to the Spanish ""Cardenas,"" let me observe that she did not come to me in such a manner as to command the highest degree of courtesy or respect. The ""Cardenas"" left Havana on the 31st of May, after epidemic yellow fever had
made its appearance there, bringing many passengers, a large portion of whom were rebels who had been in Havana buying arms and munitions of war for the Confederates, having on board to bring her up the river two pilots who had successfully conducted vessels through the blockade.
She ran past the Forts without stopping, which was permitted, for she was mistaken for the United States Steamer ""Connecticut"" then hourly expected, which mistake caused the ""Connecticut"" to be fired at when she made her appearance and attempted to go by without reporting.
The ""Cardenas"" then loitered up the river till near night and, without coming up to the usual place of landing or reporting to the harbor-master, came along side a wharf some three miles below the usual places of steamboat landing, and put on shore her passengers without passports being examined, or any report to any person, so that many obnoxious persons escaped into the city, and the Provost Marshal has never been able to ascertain the character of all the passengers.
Will it be pretended that any captain of a Spanish steamer is so ignorant as not to know that such conduct is in the highest degree improper in landing passengers at a military Post?
Mr. Tarsara says well ""that no difficulty was made about the landing of the passengers from the Steamer."" True, because they and their luggage were surreptitiously landed miles below the usual landing place without the knowledge of any person friendly with the United States, but evidently with the knowledge of the Secessionists, because the Captain says in his protest that ""crowds invaded the vessel as soon as she made the wharf.""
She was ordered back to Quarantine, but many frivolous excuses and delays were interposed by her officers until a most peremptory order accompanied by a threat was given, which she obeyed.
After a proper Quarantine the ""Cardenas"" came up -- not thirty days, but one precisely such as was thought sufficient. I do not understand Mr. Tarsara's notions about reciprocity in Quarantine. He seems to insist that if we require a long Quarantine at New Orleans, the Governor General of Cuba will require an equally long Quarantine at Havana. But what need of a Quarantine at all against epidemic yellow fever in a port where it is already raging in its most virulent form? What possible reciprocity of Quarantine could there be between
Iceland and Vera Cruz? I have endeavored to make Quarantine a sensible not a senseless regulation.
It is complained, however, that the U. S. Steamer ""Roanoake"" suffered a shorter detention at Quarantine than the ""Cardenas,"" and that she sailed from Havana on the day after. This is an uncandid way of stating the fact. The ""Roanoke"" sailed from New York, went into the harbor at Havana, stayed there less than 24 hours, and held little or no communication with the shore. Her Captain reported her at the Quarantine station as direct from New York. Was there any reason for so long a Quarantine for her as for a vessel loaded in Havana?
When the ""Roanoke"" was about to sail for New York on her return trip from New Orleans, a large number of Spanish persons were desirous of taking passage in her for Havana, and engaged passage accordingly. Upon application to the Spanish Consul for a bill of health, as the purser of the ""Roanoke"" informed me, the Consul or Vice Consul told him that as ""I had quarantined the ‘Cardenas,’ the Consul would not give the ‘Roanoke’ a bill of health, but would report that New Orleans was afflicted with epidemic fever unless I would permit the ‘Cardenas’ to come up, and if so, a clean bill of health would be given.""
The effect of, and motive for, this conduct was obvious. If the ""Roanoke"" went to Havana and carried her passengers, she would take away this business from the ""Cardenas."" If she carried such a bill of health as to put her in Quarantine at Havana, no New York passengers would sail in her, so that she must lose one or the other lot of passengers. This seemed to me so unjust that I sent for the Consul for an explanation. I understood his explanations to be exactly what the purser of the ""Roanoke"" had informed me had been told him.
It is proper here to remark that I have been since assured by the Spanish Consul, for whom I really entertain a high respect, that his conversation was misunderstood by all parties, neither understanding the other's language.
I told the Consul at that time that any retaliation upon the ""Roanoke"" for any supposed wrong done by me to the ""Cardenas"" ought not to be permitted. That if he slandered the health of the City of New Orleans, by giving any report that epidemic yellow fever existed here when he knew it not to be the fact, preventing trade and commerce coming to this port by such false reports, that I would certainly send him out of the
city to Havana, and report his conduct to the Captain General, as the nearest Spanish Authority. And in that event, this I most assuredly would have done. That the bill of health of the ""Roanoke"" must be such as required by the laws and his instructions, precisely as if nothing had been done to the ""Cardenas.""
To this (as he was interpreted to me to say) the Consul replied that he would not give a clean bill of health to the ""Roanoke"" because it was now past the first of June, and whatever might be the health of the city, in fact he must report it unhealthy. Further, that if I still held the ""Cardenas"" under Quarantine, he would write to the Captain General of Cuba not to send any more vessels here.
To that I replied that he would give my compliments to the Captain General, and say that until the yellow fever season was over he could do me and the city no greater favor than to prevent vessels from coming here. I then put in writing and gave the Consul my claim that he should give a bill of health to the ""Roanoke,"" required by the laws and regulations of his government, regardless of my treatment of the ""Cardenas."" The interview here ended.
The bill of health, however, which was given to the ""Roanoke"" was such (although the city was perfectly healthy) that her officers did not dare to sail to Havana, lest they should be held to Quarantine there, in a city where the small-pox and yellow fever were both raging, and was in consequence obliged to discharge her Havana passengers and pay back the passage money.
I take leave to observe upon a remark of Mr. Tarsara, the Spanish Minister, that I had not the authority to send out of my lines the Spanish Consul for so gross a dereliction of duty that in the first place I should have done it if the occasion had called, and that secondly I knew of no law, National or municipal, that requires the Commander of a captured city, occupied as a military Post, to keep any person in it, Consul or others, who are deliberately working to render the place untenable, by keeping away supplies or provisions from it through false reports.
I wish, however, again to say, the subsequent conversation through a more intelligent interpreter in his understanding of English has convinced me that Mr. Callejon, the Consul's, remarks were misinterpreted and mistaken by me as mine were by him. These subsequent explanations have, I believe,
established the most cordial relation between us. I have also learned that I have done Mr. Callejon an injustice in another respect, in supposing him, as I was informed, to be a Spanish merchant. Such I am now assured is not the case, but he is a soldier who has won honorable distinction in the wars of his own country.
In Mr. Tarsara's letter of complaint it is alleged that I have permitted the French brigantine ""Maria Felicia"" and English schooner ""Virginia Antoinette,"" and other vessels, to come up without the same length of quarantine as the ""Cardenas."" These facts it is said will convict me of ""capricious discrimination against Spain in favor of other European Nations."" There is no reason given why I should be possessed of feeling which would lead me thus to discriminate. Indeed, if I permitted my indignation and sense of wrong as regards the manner in which my Government has been treated by other Nations to influence my official action, I assure you, Spain would not be the Nation toward which those feelings would find most active operations. On the contrary, I have felt that the conduct of Spain has been most friendly, especially taking into view the wrong done her by some of the citizens of the United States in the invasion of Cuba. No Rebel privateers have fitted out from her ports. I have not known that any of her islands have been made Arsenals or Naval depots for the Confederacy, and I have yet to be informed of any discrimination made by her between our armed vessels and those of our enemy. I have ventured to say this much because in weighing one's acts motives are specially to be looked at.
I beg to refer you to the reports of my Medical Director, Dr. McCormick, for the history of the objected cases taken from the Quarantine Records, which I believe will in every case justify the action taken.
Perhaps, however, the two cases of the ""Marie Felicia"" and the ""Virginia Antoinette"" deserve a word of comment, as they illustrate the animus with which our Quarantine has been conducted. The ""Marie,"" having an acclimated crew, had been loaded at Havre and only touched at Havana without landing, was detained only long [enough] to examine her present condition as to health, presuming that she contained no latent disease or malaria, which would lose its virus or develop itself by time. The ""Virginia,"" having only touched at Havana, was without passengers, and laden wholly with
loose salt, a powerful disinfectant in itself, one might as well quarantine a barrel of chloride of lime. And yet permitting of this schooner to come up after 20 days absence from this port, is brought forward as evidence of ""capricious discrimination against the Spanish Government.""
I have also appended the letter from the Captain of the Spanish war vessel, the ""Pinta,"" which will show the manner in which our Quarantine has been conducted, and that his only complaint is that I have not obeyed some law of Louisiana regulating time of Quarantine.
Mr. Tarsara, in his communication of the 28th of June, wishes the Secretary of State to require me ""to treat the Consuls of foreign nations with more consideration, and that I must refrain from expressions which are not suited to give security to trade or maintain friendly relations between the authorities of the Island and those of the United States.""
It will be seen by examination of the letter of the Commander of the ""Blasco de Garay,"" hereto annexed under date of August 13th, that there is the complaint that my acts do not come up to the profession of friendship and the courtesies of my language I have therefore appended all of the more important of my correspondence with the Spanish authorities here, so that the Department may see whether either in the manner or matter of that correspondence there is anything which should be a casus belli between two otherwise friendly nations.
That I answered somewhat sharply the letter of the captain of the ""Blasco de Garay,"" who seized the occasion in replying to a note wherein I offered him assistance and courtesy to read me a lecture on my duties, I admit I thought and still think I was justified in so doing.
A nation may be friendly and its Consul quite the reverse, as witness the late Prussian Consul, who is now a General in the Rebel Army, for which he recruited a battalion of his countrymen.
When, therefore, I find a Consul aiding the rebels, I must treat him as a rebel, and the exceptions are very few indeed among the Consuls here. Bound up with the rebels by marriage, commercial and social relations, most of the Consular offices are only asylums where rebels are harbored and rebellion fostered.
Before I close this report, which pressure of public duties has delayed till the departure of the mail on the 6th October,
allow me to repeat that with the blessing of God, to whom our most devout thanks are daily due for His Goodness, the fell scourge, the Yellow Fever, has been kept from my Command and the City of New Orleans till now, when all danger is past by firm administration of sanitary and Quarantine regulations, in spite of complaints and difficulties, and if any acts need justification I point to the results as an unanswerable vindication. I have the honor to be

"November 17, 1862","Private. Navy Department, November 17th, 1862
Major General B. F. Butler
My dear General: I have your letter of October 2nd, and its enclosure for Mrs. F. of the carte de visite of the General commanding the department of the Gulf. She thanks you for the remembrance which will be more valuable than the purchased one occupying a place in her album. I also received your letter about raising the wrecks in the lower Mississippi, and delayed answering it to ascertain if certain parties who contracted to raise the ""Varuna"" were going to comply with their contract. I am satisfied that they are not, and therefore the question of raising that vessel is open unless the Father of waters has closed it.
With regard to some of the other vessels, there are two owners. Take for example, the ram ""Manassas,"" owned
mostly by parties in Boston, seized, enlarged, fitted, and mailed by the Rebels, and sunk by Smith. If she is raised, who takes her? I know of no person in the country so competent to handle these questions as the General in whose Department they lie buried, and therefore advise you to contract on the spot for the saving of this property. If, after raising, any, especially the ""Varuna,"" can be used for Naval purposes, the Government ought to have the right to take them by open sale or some other fair, reasonable methods.
The Secretary of the Navy is of the opinion that you ought to take measures to save as much as possible of this property to the Government. It cannot be done by contract here as parties competent to undertake it are entirely ignorant of the surroundings.
I am very glad to find that the complaints against your administration have been dissipated by the vigor and success of your Government, civil and military. Lee fought your battles frankly and manfully, commencing at a dinner at Fort Monroe, given by General Dix to Reverdy Johnson and his New Orleans friends.
Lee, being a Southern man, gave weight to his opinions. I hear not a word now, except ""looting,"" as the English call it, an amusement that all soldiers indulge in. The Rebels in Maryland and Kentucky took everything they wanted, and in return, -- oh, refinement of abstinence, -- offered Confederate scrip in payment, besides all kinds of brown paper shin-plasters.
I think McClernand will be down your way near the last of December, and if you and Farragut can open the Mississippi as far as the Red River, and block that leaky place, we shall be able with our Mississippi squadron to keep that big river open to commerce, and New Orleans will rise from its lethargy. My opinion is that neither you or Farragut have a sufficient force to attack Mobile, and I have written so to him. We shall be along that way with iron-clads during the winter, and then make short work of it. You ought to have and will shortly have more troops, as the occupation of Texas, and most particularly the Rio Grande, is imperative. Every vessel we seize there is released by the courts, and the enormous trade carried on can only be turned into legitimate channels by military occupations up the river. I have begged for troops for this object.
In military matters here, we are quiet but expectant. The luxurious army of the Potomac, petted to bursting, is no match in celerity of movements to the famished, freezing, soldiers of
Lee. Legs win more battles than fighting. At Bull Run one of our soldiers was found dead with seventeen pounds of Congressional documents and a History of Ireland in his knapsack.
Whence did you surmise that Farragut was to be relieved? We never heard the rumor here. The hero of that unequalled dash, despising the great obstacles, gave us victory, glory, and New Orleans, and is not to be forgotten or removed except at his own pleasure, and probably not even then. If he is with you, I beg that you will assure him that we never heard of any such rumor this way. Wishing you every success, my dear General, in your arduous position, I remain,
Truly your friend, G. V. Fox"

"October 12, 1862","Headquarters Department of the Gulf, New Orleans, October 12, 1862
Hon. E. M. Stanton Secretary of War
Sir: I have the honor to report the facts and circumstances of my General Orders No. 55 in answer to the complaints of the Prussian and French legations, as to the enforcement of that order upon certain inhabitants of New Orleans, claimed to be the subjects of these respective Governments.
Before discussing the special and personal relations of the several complaints, it will be necessary in a general way to give an account of the state of things which I found had existed, and was then existing, at New Orleans upon its capture by the Federal Troops, to show the status of the several classes upon which General Orders No. 55 takes effect.
In October, 1861, about the time Mason and Slidell left the city upon their mission to Europe to obtain the intervention of the foreign powers, great hopes were entertained by the rebels that the European Governments would be induced to inter-fere from the want of a supply of cotton. This supply was being had to a degree through the agency of the small vessels shooting out by the numerous Bayous, Lagoons, and creeks with which the southern part of Louisiana is penetrated, eluded the blockade, and conveyed very considerable amounts of cotton to Havana and other foreign ports, where rams and munitions of war were largely imported through the same channels in exchange. Indeed, as I have before had the honor to inform the Department of State, it was made a condition of the very passes given by Governor Moore that a quantity of arms and powder should be returned in proportion to the cotton shipped.
The very high prices of the outward as well as the inward cargoes made these ventures profitable, although but one in three got through in safety.
Nor does the fact that so considerable quantities of cotton escaped the blockading force at all impugn the efficiency of the blockading squadron, when it is taken into consideration that without using either of the principal water communications with the city through the ""Rigolets"" or the ""Passes"" at the Delta of the river, there are at least 53 distinct outlets to the Gulf from New Orleans by water communication by light-draught vessels. Of course, not a pound of the cotton that went through these channels found its way North unless
it was purchased at a foreign port. To prevent even this supply of the European manufactures, became an object of the greatest interest of the rebels, and prior to October 1861 all the principal cotton factors of New Orleans, to the number of about a hundred, united in an address, signed with their names, to the planters, advising them not to send their cotton to New Orleans, for the avowed reason that if it was sent the cotton will find its way to foreign ports and furnish the interest of Europe and the United States with the product of which they are most in need . . . and thus contribute to the maintainance of that quasi neutrality, which European Nations have thought proper to avow.
""This address proving ineffectual to maintain the policy we had determined upon, and which not only received the sanction of public opinion here, but which has been so promptly and cheerfully followed by the planters and factors of the other States of the Confederacy,"" the same cotton factors made a petition to Governor Moore and General Twiggs to ""devise means to prevent any shipment of Cotton to New Orleans whatever.""
For answer to the petition, Governor Moore issued a proclamation forbidding the bringing of cotton within the city limits under the penalties therein prescribed. This action was concurred in by General Twiggs, then in command of the Confederate forces, and enforced by newspaper articles published in the leading Journals.
I have appended the exhibits of proclamation of the Governor, the order of General Twiggs, the petition of the Cotton Factors, and an article on the subject by one of the most widely circulated Journals, in papers marked ""A"" & ""B,"" wherein the whole matter is fully set forth.
This was one of the series of offensive measures which was undertaken by the mercantile community of New Orleans, of which a large portion were foreigners, and of which the complaint of Order 55 formed a part in aid of the rebellion.
The only cotton allowed to be shipped during the autumn and winter of 1861 & 1862 was by permits of Governor Moore, granted upon express condition that at least one half in value should be returned in arms and munitions of war. In this traffic, almost the entire mercantile houses of New Orleans were engaged. Joint stock companies were formed, shares issued, vessels bought, cargoes shipped, arms returned, immense profits realized, and the speculative and trading energy of the
whole community was turned in this direction. It will be borne in mind that quite two-thirds of the trading community were foreign-born, and now claim exemption from all duties as citizens and exemption from liabilities for all their acts because of being ""foreign neutrals.""
When the expedition, which I had the high honor to be intrusted to command, landed at Ship Island, and seemed to threaten New Orleans, the most energetic efforts were made by the State and Confederate authorities for the defence of the city. Nearly the entire foreign population of the city enrolled itself in Companies, Battalions and Brigades, representing different Nationalities. They were armed, uniformed, and equipped, drilled and manoeuvered, reported for service to the Confederate Generals. Many of the foreign officers took the oath of allegiance to the Confederate States. The Brigadier General in command of the European Brigade, Paul Juge a naturalized citizen of the United States but born in France, renounced his citizenship and applied to the French Government to be restored to his former citizenship as a native of that country at the very time he held his command in the foreign legion.
The Prussian Consul, now General Reichard of the Confederate army, of whom we shall [say] more in the course of this report, raised a Battalion of his countrymen and went to Virginia, where he has been promoted for his gallantry in the rebel service, leaving his commercial partner, Mr. Kruttschnidt, now acting Prussian Consul, who has married the sister of the rebel Secretary of War, to embarrass as much as possible the United States officers here by subscriptions to ""city defense funds,"" and groundless complaints to the Prussian Minister.
I have thus endeavored to give a faithful and exact account of the state of the foreign population of New Orleans of the fifteenth day of Feb., 1862.
In October, 1861, the city had voted to erect a battery out of this ""defence fund,"" as will appear by exhibit extract of the Delta Newspaper marked ""C."" On the 19th of February, 1862, the City Council by vote published and commented upon in the newspapers, placed in the hands of the Confederate General Lovell fifty thousand Dollars ($50,000), to be expended by him in the defence of the city. This resolution is appended from a published newspaper copy marked ""D.""
It will therefore clearly appear that all inhabitants of the
city knew that the City Council were raising and expending large sums for war purposes.
On the 20th of the same February, the City Council raised an extraordinary ""Committee on Public Safety"" from the body of inhabitants at large, consisting of sixty members, for the ""purpose of cooperating with the Confederate and State authorities in devising means for the defence of the city and its approaches."" This will appear from exhibit marked ""E,"" a published newspaper copy of the resolution raising such committee.
On the 27th of the same February, the City Council adopted a series of resolutions: 1st. recommending the issue of One Million Dollars of the City Bonds for the purpose of purchasing arms and munitions of war, and to provide for the successful defence of the city and its approaches.
2nd. To appropriate Twenty-five thousand Dollars for the purpose of uniforming and equipping soldiers mustered into the service of the country.
3rd. Pledging the Council ""to support the families of all soldiers who shall volunteer for the war.""
This will appear more at large in the published newspaper copy on the resolutions, marked ""F.""
On the 3rd of March, 1862, the City Council authorized the Mayor to issue bonds of the city for a million of Dollars, and provided that the Chairman of the Finance Committee might pay over the said bonds to the Committee of Public Safety appointed by the Common Council of the City of New Orleans, as per resolution No. 8930, approved 20th of February, 1862, in such sums as they may require for the purchase of arms and munitions of war, provisions, or to provide any means for the successful defence of the city and its approaches. And at the same time authorized the Chairman of the Finance Committee ""to pay over $25,000 to troops mustered into the State service, who should go to fight at Columbus or elsewhere under General Beauregard."" This will appear by Exhibit marked ""G,"" of the published newspaper copy of the doings of the City Council.
It was to this fund, in the hands of this extraordinary Committee, so published with its objects and purposes, that the complainants subscribed their money, and now claim exemption upon the ground of neutrality, and want of knowledge of the purpose of the funds.
It will be remembered that all the steps of the raising of
the Committee to dispose of this fund were published, and matters of great public notoriety. That the fact that the bonds were in the hands of such an extraordinary Committee should have put any prudent person on their guard.
That all the leading Secessionists of the City were subscribers to the same fund.
Will it be pretended for a moment that these persons -- Bankers, Merchants, Brokers -- who are making this complaint, did not know what this fund was, and its purposes to which they were subscribing by thousands of dollars?
[Had] Mr. Rochereau, for instance, who had taken an oath to support the Confederate States, a banker, and then a Colonel commanding a body of troops in the service of the Confederates, never heard for what purposes the city was raising a million and a quarter in bonds?
Take the Prussian Consul, who complains for himself and the Mrs. Vogel whom he represents, as an example. Did he know about this fund? He, a trader, a Jew famed for a bargain, married the sister of the rebel Secretary of War, the partner of General Reichard, late Prussian Consul, then in command of the Confederate army, who subscribed for himself, his partner, and Mrs. Vogel, the wife of his former partner, thirty thousand Dollars, did he not know what he was doing when he bought the bonds of this ""Committee of Public Safety""?
On the contrary, it was done to aid the rebellion to which he was bound by his sympathies, his social relations, his business connections, and marriage ties! But it is said that this subscription was made to the fund for the sake of the investment. It will appear, however, by a careful examination, that Mr. Kruttschnidt collected for his principal a note secured by mortgage in anticipation of its being due, in order to purchase twenty-five thousand dollars of this loan. See his letter to Mrs. Vogel. Without, however, descending into the particulars, is the profitableness of the investment to be permitted to be alleged as a sufficient apology for aiding the rebellion by money and arms? If so, all their army contractors, principally Jews, should be held blameless, for they have made immense fortunes by the war. Indeed, I suppose another Jew -- one Judas -- thought his investment in the thirty pieces of silver was a profitable one, until the penalty of treachery reached him.
When I took possession of New Orleans I found the city
nearly on the verge of starvation, but thirty days' provisions in it, and the poor utterly without the means of procuring what food there was to be had.
I endeavored to aid the City Government in the work of feeding the poor, but I soon found that the very contribution of food was a means faithlessly used to encourage the rebellion. I was obliged, therefore, to take the whole matter into my own hands. It became a subject of alarming importance and gravity. It became necessary to provide from some source the funds to procure the food. They could not be raised by city taxation in the ordinary form. These taxes were in arrears to more than a million of dollars. Besides, it would be unjust to tax the loyal citizens and honestly neutral foreigners to provide for a state of things brought about by the rebels and disloyal foreigners related to them by ties of blood, marriage, and social relation, who had conspired and labored together to overthrow the authority of the United States, and establish the very result which was to be met. Further, in order to have a contribution effective, it must be upon those who had wealth to answer it.
There seems to me no such fit subjects for such taxation as the Cotton Brokers, who had brought the distress upon the city by thus paralysing commerce, and the subscribers to this loan who had money to invest for purposes of war, so advertised and known as above described.
With these conditions, I issued General Orders No. 55, which will explain itself, and is annexed marked ""H,"" and have raised nearly the amount of the tax therein set forth.
But for what purpose? Not a dollar has gone in any way to the use of the United States. I am now employing 1,000 poor laborers as matter of charity upon the streets and wharves of the city from this fund. I am distributing food to preserve from starvation 9707 families, containing ""Thirty-Two Thousand and Four Hundred and Fifty souls"" daily, and this done at an expense of more than Seventy Thousand Dollars per month. I am sustaining, at the expense of Two Thousand Dollars per month, five asylums for widows and orphans. I am aiding the Charity Hospital to the extent of Five Thousand Dollars per month.
I beg leave to call your attention to the exhibits marked, ""I and K,"" attached hereto. These are synopses of the weekly returns of my Relief Committee that distributes the food.
Before their Excellencies the French and Prussian Ministers complain of my actions upon foreigners at New Orleans, I desire they would look at these exhibits, and consider for a few moments the facts and figures set forth in these returns and in this report. They will find that out of 10,490 families who have been fed from the fund, with the raising of which they find fault, less than one tenth (One thousand and ten) are Americans, nine thousand four hundred and eighty, foreigners. Of the thirty-two thousand souls but three thousand are natives. Besides, the Charities at the Asylums and hospitals are distributed in about the same proportions as to foreigners and native born, so that of an expenditure of near $80,000 per month to employ and feed the starving poor of New Orleans, seventy-two thousand goes to the foreigners, whose compatriots loudly complain, and offensively thrust forward their neutrality when ever they are called upon to aid their suffering countrymen.
I should need no extraordinary taxation to feed the poor of New Orleans if the bellies of the foreigners were as active with the rebels as are the heads of those who claim exemption thus far of this taxation, made and used for purposes above set forth upon the grounds of their neutrality. I find Mr. Rochereau & Co., the senior partner of which took an oath of allegiance to support the Constitution of the Confederate States. I find also the house of Reichard & Co., the senior partner of which, General Reichard, is in the rebel army, the junior partner Mr. Kruttschnidt, the brother in law of Benjamin, the rebel Secretary of War, using all funds in his hands to purchase arms, and collecting the securities of his correspondent before they are due to get funds to loan to rebel authorities, and now acting Prussian Consul here, doing quite as effective service to the rebels as his partner in the field. Mr. Vogel, late partner in the same house of Reichard & Co., now absent, whose funds are managed by that house. Mr. Paesher & Co. Bankers, whose clerks and employees formed a part of the French Legion, organized to fight the United States, and who contributed largely to arm and equip that corps. And a Mr. Lewis, whose antecedents I have not had time to investigate. -- And these are fair specimens of the neutrality of the foreigners for whom the Government is called upon to interfere, to prevent their paying anything toward the Relief Fund for their starving countrymen.
If the representatives of the Foreign Governments will feed
their own starving people, over whom the only protection they extend, so far as I see, is to tax them all, poor and rich, a dollar and a half each for certificates of nationality, I will release these foreigners from all the exactions, fines, and imposts whatever. I have the honor to be

"October 12, 1862","Headquarters Department of the Gulf, New Orleans, October 12, 1862
Hon. E. M. Stanton, Secretary of War
Sir: In obedience to the request of the Department by letter of Sept. 18th, that I would report ""all the facts and circumstances which are the subject of the complaint of Mr. Tarsara, Spanish Minister at Washington, concerning the action of the United States Authorities in relation to the house of Puig Brothers, Spanish trader of this city, I beg leave to submit the following:
My police and detective officers received information from the most reliable sources that the house of Puig Bros. had been and still was carrying on the nefarious traffic of supplying the rebels with arms and munitions of War from Havana, and for that purpose one of the partners was a resident of Havana, to ship the contraband articles which the other received and distributed here.
Acting upon this information, a seizure of the House was ordered, together with their books and papers, for the purpose of obtaining at the same time evidence of the facts and security for the appearance of the parties, one of whom had absconded at the moment. The books and papers show the most conclusive evidence of the criminal complicity of the House in breaking the neutrality laws in every possible form.
The resident partner here had just taken refuge on board the Spanish vessel of War, ""Blasco De Garay,"" and upon inquiry for him there, his presence was denied. I beg leave in this connection to call the attention of the War Department, and ask that the attention of the Secretary of State, and through him the Spanish Minister, may be informed of the fact that a Spanish man-of-war lying in this harbor, is made the fraudulent asylum of criminals, protecting them from justice and trial.
How far such conduct can be justified by the Comity of
Nations I have a very decided opinion, and certainly, if not otherwise authoritatively advised by the War Department, upon the repetition of such conduct, I shall order and enforce the absence of the offending vessel from the harbor.
Being made aware of these facts, and of the place of refuge of the criminal, as will appear by the affidavits of the Messrs. Cabezas and Calleja (copies of which are hereto annexed), I did not choose to pursue the investigation of the case of an absconding criminal in his absence, when he was putting me at defiance on board of a man-of-war of a friendly power.
Therefore, when the Spanish Consul made application for an explanation of the causes of the seizure of the House of Puig Bros., as soon as I was ready to go on with the trial, I replied that ""I would continue the investigation if he would bring Mr Puig before me.""
This I did because I was assured that the Spanish Consul knew of and connived at the place of concealment of Puig, and I did not wish to involve myself with the Spanish Authorities in attempting to take Puig from his place of refuge on board of the man-of-war by force, but rather if he thought himself innocent that he should come forward. I believe that if Puig desired in good faith to have an investigation which would establish his innocence, that he would come forward, and I did not believe that it would be decent to my own self-respect, to try the question of Puig's guilt with the Spanish authorities by correspondence, while they concealed the criminal, so that if found guilty, he would be beyond my reach.
I observe that Mr. Tarsara makes it a matter of complaint that my note to the Spanish Consul was by the hand of one of my Adjutants. I am not aware of any exaltation of rank in a Spanish commercial agent which obliges a Major General of the U. S. Army to answer his communications by his own hand; besides, there being some ten Consular agents here, who are continually writing letters upon the most frivolous subjects, as well as those of graver importance to me, answers in person have become a physical impossibility, specially taken in connection with the voluminous correspondence entailed upon me by the complaints of their several ministers which I am obliged by courtesy to answer with my own hand.
To estabish beyond cavil or doubt the deep-dyed criminality of the ""most respectable House of Puig Bros.,"" I enclose herewith a certified copy of a receipt given as lately as November last to a rebel Custom house officer by that House, for the
delivery of many arms and many pounds of powder and lead, imported by that ""most respectable House of neutral Spanish subjects,"" but in fact army contractors of the Confederate States.
Unless the United States are to lose their manhood altogether. I trust I shall not be called upon to allow to pass unchecked this nefarious traffic under the high-sounding plea of ""Highly respectable House of Neutrals.""
As to the insinuated charge in Mr. Tarsara's communication, that anyone in this Department has interfered with the official correspondence of the Spanish Legation with the Spanish Consul at New Orleans, ""all the facts or circumstances"" I have to report on such complaint are that it has not the slightest foundation of fact.
After many weeks of delay it happened that one of my detective officers, having had his integrity overcome by the atmosphere of fraud and iniquity with which the rebels and their agents, such as Puig Bros., had surrounded New Orleans, was detected in the act of criminal embezzlement, for which prompt punishment was meted to him. This seemed to give favorable occasion to one of Puig's clerks to make a claim for loss, which I had reason to believe fraudulent, and I so characterized it in a communication to the Spanish Consul, which he has not forwarded to his Minister, or which, if he has so sent, has not been sent to the Secretary of State.
I will remark, from that time I have heard nothing of that claim. Certain it is, if the claim was a just one, the Clerk had more valuables in his principal's house than had the merchants themselves.
Perhaps it may not be in opportune to remark further that through his Consul Mr. Puig has subsequently asked leave to come on shore from his self-imposed imprisonment on board the man-of-war, and at the last I knew of him he was at liberty on his parole awaiting trial. I have the honor to be,

"October 12, 1862","New Orleans, Oct. 12th, 1862
To Major General Butler, Commanding Department of the Gulf
General: Yesterday morning, when I had the honor to present you my humble respects, you asked me if I remembered the circumstances under which I presented myself before you in August last to ask the pardon of Mr. Chas. Heidsick, who was arrested and sent to prison for infringing the laws of the United States in crossing from the enemy side your military lines, to come to New Orleans in violation of your military orders, and what is become of the order of pardon and release you then granted?
The facts and circumstances of that affair, General, are too solemnly graved in my memory to be ever forgotten. My friend, Mr. S. Plussan, a merchant of this city, well-known by you, having been informed that Chas. Heidsick, his friend, had been arrested and sent to prison by the military authorities of the United States, prayed me to approach you in order to ascertain what could be the offence committed by his friend, and in the same time to inquire if he could be released under a security to be furnished by Mr. Plussan?
You received my demand, General, with your accustomed urbanity and kindness, and you immediately called Mr. Moses Greenwood of this city, who had been conjointly, with ten other persons, permitted to proceed with a steamer under a flag of truce to Mobile to bring back to New Orleans a certain quantity of barrels of flour, for the population there much in need of.
This gentleman stated in my presence that Chas. Heidsick, disguised as a Bar-keeper on board of said vessel, came from Mobile to New Orleans. You also asked of Mr. Greenwood if he knew the social position of Mr. Heidsick and what it was? His answer was that Mr. Heidsick was a Frenchman and a rich dealer in wines.
The proof adduced to me was that as bearer of letters from a Mr. Porte of Mobile, acting there as Vice Consul, Mr. Heidsick had crossed again your military lines in coming from Mobile to New Orleans on board of a schooner, in order to bring, as he stated, letters to the French Consul in New Orleans.
All these facts [were] also stated to me by the French Consul here, and the friends of Mr. Heidsick have told me that he
does not deny these facts, but that he contends that he is innocent of all offences whatsoever, and he never injured or caused prejudice to the Government of the United States in any manner whatsoever.
In presence of such evidence I remained confused, and I had nothing to say but to implore your clemency, General, in favor of Mr. Plussan's friend.
I then returned in painful thoughts and apprehensions of Mr. Heidsick's ultimate state, knowing well that under such circumstances, according to the usages of war and the laws of nations, the prisoner's life was at your mercy, but knowing also that your generosity and clemency has been so largely extended in New Orleans to so many unfortunate persons in grave circumstances, the hope that you would pardon Mr. Heidsick never abandoned me; and that very day I took the liberty to write to you in favor of the prisoner. The next day I went to see you; you promised to take my demand in consideration, and a few days afterwards Mr. Plussan received from you an order which released Mr. Heidsick from prison under the condition that he should leave the country for France. This order, together with a letter received from the French Consul who had it from France to the address of Mr. Heidsick, was sent him by Mr. Plussan.
It appears that Mr. Heidsick, instead of availing himself of your generous pardon, thought proper to remain in prison. What is his purpose and his intentions I desire not to know them, but I am certain that the unfortunate man is unconscious of his position. If, however, in the name of humanity. General, please not to revoke your kind order. The day is not far when Mr. Heidsick will be happy to avail himself of it in recognizing the fallacy of his pretensions. I remain, General, with a profound respect and great consideration,
Your most obedient servant, J. L. Pinot"

Benj. F. Butler, Major General Commanding
New Orleans, October 5th, 1862 Dear Sir: As you have done me some good I will return good to you.
Are you aware that the ""Blasco De Garay"" is violating the Neutrality laws? The steamer is crowded with rebel passengers who have gone on board without permission, without having taken the oath of allegiance.
I will call your attention to M. M. Delain Eustis, brother of George Eustis. He is bearer of important despatches; and a gentleman by the name of Mr. Grailhe, a gentleman of high standing, very rich, he leaves behind his wife, who resides corner Royal and Main Streets. He is a rabid Confederate, and both have been concealing themselves for the last three days on board the ship. Mr. Eustis has received those despatches by a young man who crossed the lines four days ago. He is with his wife and children.
There are besides twenty families making altogether 60 passengers.
Yours truly, Veritas"

General: Although it is not customary to pay the slightest attention to the anonymous communications, I wish to inform you that I have seen on the ""Blasco de Garay"" some persons, well acquainted with her commander, and who left for Havana with a passport from the authority of this City & also from my office; if those you have mentioned were amongst them, I did not know it, but it is not strange if they have asked the Commander of the said ship for protection, as no man-of-war in the world would refuse protection to a man in political trouble, although you may think different it cannot offend the neutrality of the Government.
It is different with common criminals, and the noble and charitable anonymous correspondent might have informed you also that a police officer came at night to my residence to tell me that a murderer was secreted on board the ""Blasco de Garay,"" and that I got out of bed and gave the necessary order, and the officers of the steamer gave all the assistance required.
The social manners of the Captain and officers of the ""Blasco de Garay"" have made them many friends in this city, but whose feelings have no relation to political affairs, but it is not strange that this anonymous correspondent is mistaken in seeing only criminals in the numerous families who wish to leave, and will do so at the last extremity.

Hon. Edwin M. Stanton, Secretary of War
Sir: I am grieved to be obliged to bring before the notice of the War Department the conduct of the several Spanish Vessels of War lately in this Port, to wit, the ""Pinta,"" ""Marie Galanti"" and ""Blasco de Garay.""
I am informed and believe that each of these vessels took on board for Cuba passengers, not only Spanish born but citizens of the United States who had been concerned in the rebellion, and who, against the orders of the Commanding General, conveyed themselves and their effects away from the Department on board of these national Vessels of War.
I have claimed the right to search them for criminals other than rebels and after much difficulty the privilege was accorded on board the first two ships. My police found there many passengers without passes -- who were not Spaniards.
The decks of the ""Blasco de Garay"" were literally covered with passengers selected with so little discrimination that my detective officers found on board as a passenger an escaped convict of the Penitentiary, who was in full flight from a most brutal murder, with his booty robbed from his victim with him on board this Vessel of War.
Now, if the Spanish Government are going into the passenger carrying business by their National War Vessels, which I cannot believe, as it would be unjust to private speculative enterprise in this branch of trade, I desire to be informed of the fact officially through His Excellency the Spanish Minister, so that I may subject these Vessels to the same regulations as other passenger carriers, otherwise I would desire the Commanders of such Vessels checked in this practice.

"October 16, 1862","Private and Unofficial. New Orleans, October 16th, 1862
Dear Sir: My last letter was in reference to trade with the enemy.
After Gen. Butler's return from Pensacola for the purpose of discussing the matter, Gen. B. asked me to his house, where I met also Gov. Shepley. In a long conversation I stated to them fully my own views, and it was understood that there should be no more trade with the enemy -- that no supplies of any kind or in any quantity should pass into the insurrectionary districts, not even supplies for loyal residents of such locality, because Guerillas would in most cases take away such supplies for their own use.
Gen. Butler and Gen. Shepley each said, however, that he had given one permit to cross the lake, not yet carried into effect. The goods were bought and vessels loaded, but that I had stopped them. It was insisted that these vessels should be allowed to proceed. I said that the permission of the Secretary ought first to be obtained.
The next morning Gen. Butler sent me the list of cargo for
the vessel, on the second leaf of which was endorsed his request that she be allowed to proceed. Gen. Shepley sent me a note to the same effect in regard to the other. A copy of the list of cargo, with Gen. Butler's original endorsement on second leaf, is herewith enclosed, marked ""A."" A copy of the list of cargo of second vessel, with Gen. Shepley's note, is herewith enclosed, marked ""B.""
It is inexpedient that I should have a controversy with the military authorities, and I let these two vessels go, with the distinct understanding, however, that nothing more was to go out.
Gen. Butler's permit was to Judge Morgan, a good Union man, who has lost much by the Rebellion.
Gen. Shepley's was to one Montgomery, who has previously taken over, among other things, 1,200 sacks salt. Gen. S. says he granted this permit at the earnest solicitation of Mr. Bouligny, -- formerly in Congress from this state, but now in Washington, -- and that Montgomery told him Bouligny was part owner of the cargo with him (Montgomery).
I think there will be no more of this trade. Gen. B. has always carried out (so far as I know) the wishes of the Gov't. when distinctly made known, and I believe he will fully carry out (in future) your views respecting this matter.
Gen. B. has more brains and energy than any other three men in New Orleans. He does an immense amount of work, and does it well. He knows and controls everything in this Department. I regret that it was necessary to write my last letter -- or rather, that the statements therein made were facts. Besides, no other officer appreciates, like Gen. Butler, the importance of freeing and arming the colored people -- and he is not afraid to do it. All the pro-slavery influence in this State cannot change him in this matter.
When Weitzel's expedition (spoken of in a late letter) goes out, Gen. B. will send the 1st Colored Regiment right into the heart of the section of the country to be taken. They will move nearly west from here, on the line of the Opelousas Railroad. I think they will do a great work. The expedition is expected to start in about two weeks. Late New York papers indicate the adoption of some plan for getting out cotton from Rebeldom. I hope it will not be done by means of trade with the enemy, which is objectionable for many reasons.
It will benefit the enemy ten times as much as the Government -- it demoralizes the army, who imagine themselves fighting for speculators -- offices will be interested, directly or
indirectly in the trade, and they and other speculators will wish the war prolonged for the sake of great profits -- the Rebels will not keep their engagements nine cases out of ten -- the rebels are terribly in want, and now is the time to deprive them of supplies. There are other objections besides those enumerated.
The greatest distress prevails in insurrectionary districts all around us. The Guerilla system injures Rebels more than the Government, and the people are becoming heartily tired of it.

My dearest wife: What a dear, petted, spoiled child it is! Never contented unless fed with bon bons and kisses! Why, I wrote as plainly as I could that I was lonely, sad without you, and you must come, come, come. You may send me that letter if you please as an example of my foolish fondness. You ungrateful girl, you. I will have it framed as a warning to all fond husbands. True, I said I wanted you to lay aside all care and be fat and rollicking as possible, and poor little wife said I didn't want to see her unless she was fat. Now, then, I have sent a steamboat for you, one of the best in the service, The ""McClellan,"" armed, so there is no fear of capture, a most experienced captain, a crew, and most neat and safe ship. Will that do? Ah! give me a kiss and be quiet.
The ""Dean"" brings this to you, and you will get ready to come by the ""McClellan"" from New York. She can be heard of at the Quartermaster's office. Maj. Strong has written for the madam to come by the same boat. Be sure to come now. Bring me from Burbanks and Chase's some embroidery that I have there, which I have paid for, also a piece of cloth, blue -- for a coat, and some blue-black velvet for trimmings, silk for lining, and buttons. I will have the coat made here. Also bring me linen enough for a dozen shirts, and fine linen cambric enough for some wrought bosoms. I have a dozen here starving for the work, so be sure and bring them -- the material. You may add something of the kind for yourself. I rather like linen chem -- Ahem! Send to Bent and Bush to make me a nice cap. They can do it with blue-black band. I want four pairs fine merino drawers, and six fine merino undershirts -- 39 inches will do for the waist.
Where is my speech and the rest of the pictures? Bring yourself at once. Mind that now! Bring me some pears and some grapes. There never was such a God-forsaken country for fruit. Bring anyone with you you like to do -- Mrs. Read or anybody else. Read has sold out his sutler's interest here, so I suppose he will not want to come. Won't George come. I should be glad to have him, and we will make a week or two here very pleasant for him. I would give more to see Fisher than anyone I know if he can possibly leave. I have drawn on him very heavily, but he has funds to meet it. He may get his sugar so that he can come out in one boat and go back in the next. Wiegel has resigned and gone home. He has been worthless since he came out, from homesickness. Maj. Bell got here yesterday, and I got your political letter -- very well indeed, but requires more time to be carried out. I am happy if I am thought outside of both parties. It's easy enough to get into a party but hard to get out honorably.
You will come, won't you? Then, dearest, dearest, we won't plague each other any more! You know you love me very much. I know it too -- you can't cheat me. You know that I love you too much for a man of forty to love a wife, so have done with all badinage and truly sincerely do come to

About the middle of May he again went into the Confederacy and remained some six weeks, and then returned.

I enjoy excellent health, and so does the Squadron generally. I shall be ready to go ahead at Gaines the moment
you can furnish the troops. Do you think you can send any down to Galveston or any other port on the coast of Texas? I had a Gun Boat out yesterday from the North, the ""Aroostook,"" but she brings no news.
Major Strong has sent two gentlemen over to see me in reference to the cattle captured by the Gun Boats, by which capture we lost a valuable officer and a sailor. I can see no use of our vessels up the river, if we are to permit passes from both Rebel and Federal authorities to stand good. The only way I see for these people to do is to make known their business before hand.
The cattle are passed over the river, and no one knows where they are going, but as soon as they are caught by either party they are intended for the party that catches them. This may be a very honest transaction, but it is one that will cause great difficulty if permitted.
My orders are very stringent, ""to allow no trade with the blockaded country."" I am told that large droves of cattle are passing the river for the Rebels, and told to look after them; when I catch them, I am told that it is all wrong, they are for us or for New Orleans. I wish you had a Prize Court at New Orleans to decide these cases and the validity of these claims.
As the officers in the ""Mississippi"" made the capture, I shall leave it to Capts. Smith and Ransom to accept a ransom and release them or not; but in future, unless the convoy is made known and asked for, they will be considered ""bona fide prize.""

Sir: I have the honor to acknowledge the receipt of despatches from the Department enclosing communication from Lord Lyons to the State Department relating to the case of Dacres.
James Dacres had applied for a passport to pass the military lines of this Department into the Confederacy. That had been refused him. He made no claim that he was a British or other subject. He was known to be in active sympathy with the rebels.
His present claim, of that he could not get a passport because of the oath which he supposes to be required of foreigners, is an afterthought, precisely as he admits his claim of British protection to be. Upon refusal, he expressed his determination to go at all hazards, and in company with two or three other persons attempted to escape across the lines. He was arrested in the attempt. His pockets contained many communications from the rebels here to their friends, which he was taking out in direct violation of orders.
After his arrest, he showed his guilty knowledge and purpose by stealthily putting his hand in his pockets and throwing these communications into the mud, from whence they were taken by the officer of the Guard. After a full hearing of the matter in person, I have ordered him into confinement until further orders. This I feel to be within my power and duty, and I have seen in his letters no statement why I should alter these orders.
In relation to Mr. Dacres' complaints of his place of confinement and the shelter afforded him, permit me to say that he has the same shelter, the same food, the same climate, and the same exposure to disease, and no more, as the troops that guard him.
I believe him to be a dangerous man at large, but I will release him and put him on board an English Ship of War if he can be carried to that country whose protection he claims. I have the honor to be,

Fallon was an overseer of a plantation near Baton Rouge, was arrested as he says, and released upon his parole by the officer commanding the expedition, he, Fallon, claiming to be a British subject. He then went out, as I am informed by evidence, into the field, and despatched a negro to give information to a neighboring Guerilla Camp, which it was our purpose to surprise, of the approach of my troops. He admits,
in his communication to Lord Lyons, that he conversed with the negroes in the field upon the subject, and certain it is that one of them went. Fallon claims that he did not send him. But how long is it since British subjects, overseers of plantations, have been so familiar with the negroes under their charge? General Williams examined his case at Baton Rouge, was satisfied of his guilt, and referred it to me.
On examination, and upon Fallon's own story, I was satisfied, and sent him to Fort St. Philip for safe keeping, where he enjoys the same treatment, the same climate, the same shelter, and the same food that the Union Troops do. I have the honor to be,

The house of Avendaño Bros. has been established in New Orleans so long that its members have become an integral part of the population, in interest, in feeling, and in social ties. Before the breaking out of this rebellion, its members never thought of seeking the protection of Spain. But since this rebellion all has changed, and now the Spanish Consul claims that persons thirty years of age, born of Spanish parents, who have lived here from their birth, and their ancestors before them, are still Spanish subjects, and is issuing certificates of nationality accordingly, so that this city has become almost entirely depopulated as to citizens, except of free persons of color, who singularly claim the protection of our Government where so little has been heretofore done for them.
The house of Avendaño Bros. has been largely engaged in running cotton through the blockade, and importing arms and munitions of war.
As I have had the honor to inform the State Department in a communication in relation to the complaints of the Prussian Minister, and to which I beg leave to refer the Hon.
Secretary for a full development of the condition of things here in this behalf, no cotton was allowed by the Confederates to be shipped unless arms and munitions of war were returned in the proportion of one-half. Avendaño Bros. shipped largely under this permission, and have been engaged in breaking every law of neutrality and national hospitality that can be well conceived.
Somewhere about the 10th of May, I captured the Confederate steamer ""Fox,"" which had been seized by the Confederates from her Union owners, and turned into the service employed in running the blockade (She made three trips thus). She had on board a cargo of arms, powder, lead, quick-silver, acids for telegraphic purposes, chloroform and morphine for medical stores, to the amount of $300,000 or thereabouts -- all of the greatest necessity to the rebels, and had run into the Bayou La Fairche on the west bank of the Mississippi, from which bayou she might, if she thought proper, run to Vicksburg. She had, besides, the invoices, letters of advice, bills of lading, bills of exchange, and other evidence of the transactions of many of the mercantile houses of New Orleans.
The letters of advice, bills of lading, and invoices, show the nature of the transaction between these parties and their correspondents at Havana. The bills of exchange were the product of the shipment of cotton, less the proportion invested in contraband goods. Among them were the bills of exchange payable to the house of Avendaño, the first having been forwarded by some other conveyance, but still unpaid, and these bills of exchange were for one-half the proceeds of the cargo shipped, the other half being invested in munitions of war.
This vessel also carried a mail containing, among other things, the official correspondence between the Rebel Commissioner Rost, which I forwarded to the State Department, and the Rebel Ordnance officer in Europe, relating to his movements there, which I forwarded to the State Department as well as other important letters which developed the nature of the business carried on between this port and the mis-called neutral ports Havana and Nassau. Upon personal examination, I had no doubt that the house of Avendaño was largely interested in, or the consignors of, the major part of the cargo of the ""Fox,"" and in order to put a stop to this traffie, which could still be carried on through the fifty-three openings into the Gulf of Mexico from Louisiana, I called upon
the house of Avendaño, and upon personal examination they did not deny the part they had taken in the traffic.
I required them therefore, having captured in bulk one-half the fruits of this illegal traffic, and having captured the other half thereof in the shape of a bill of exchange, to pay over the other half, being the bills of exchange. This they did, and received the bills of exchange and papers showing the nature of their business, regarding that as a light punishment for their crimes.
Because of other like transactions which have since come to my knowledge, the senior partner has escaped to Havana, but the house is still carrying on business here, and are the consignees of the steamer ""Cardenas,"" which has been the cause of so many breaches of our Quarantine laws and so many complaints of the Spanish Minister.
Avendaño sent a rebel lawyer, who had refused to renew his oath of allegiance to the United States, to me to make some representations of the matter, and to argue certain legal questions. In answer to some suggestions as to the amount of fine, I told him that Avendaño might think himself well off if he lost no more of the profits of his infernal trade.
This, it will be observed, was about the 19th of May, and no complaints are made of it for three months; until emboldened by the success of the complaints of the Commissioner here, which has done more to strengthen the hand of secession than any other occurrence of the South West since my advent in New Orleans, and the Commissioner of which Commission now, as I am ready to prove, acted as the paid attorney of rebels in making claims against the United States, from retainers taken because of his acting here in his official capacity.
This Commission, I say, emboldened these new complaints of my action by mercantile pirates and maurauders, who supplied arms and powder to traitors, and are only saved from consequence of treason because they have not given their allegiance to the country that had given them protection, and enabled them to accumulate fortunes, advantages they believed their own governments could not give them, and so preferred to live under ours, but not to assume their proper obligations.
They should have been hanged, they were only fined.
His Excellency, the Spanish Minister, seems to think that running the blockade carries its own punishment with it; but this is not a case of running a blockade merely, but is the case of an importer of arms, of an army contractor for the
rebel Government, and this draft which the House of Avendaño has paid, and the money been used for the support of the troops of the United States in this Department, is only one half of the proceeds of a single adventure of the House of Avendaño in breaking the laws and aiding the rebellion, -- the other half being returned to the Confederates in arms and munitions of war.
I aver to the Secretary of War, upon my official responsibility, that without the aid furnished by foreign mercantile houses in New Orleans, Mobile, Savannah, and Charleston, as I am convinced by the most irrefragible evidence, this rebellion would have wholly failed to arm and supply itself, and the most active agents and the most efficient supporters have been these same quasi foreign houses, mostly Jews, and their correspondents, principally in Havana and Nassau, who all deserve to receive at the hand of the Government as much reprobation as the Jew, Benjamin Slidell, Mallony, or Fleyd, and only the strong repressing measures which have been fearlessly and energetically taken in this Department have prevented the supply from still going on here, as it is in Charleston, South Carolina.
Tempted by the immense profits, urging the war on in order to realize these profits, these foreign adventurers have done everything they could to sustain the war and to inflame the passions of the people against the United States; and then reiterated complaints of my actions, and the howl in Europe and elsewhere set up by them at my every act have simply been the result of the disappointment of those who desire that some action may be taken by the Government which will reopen to them a most profitable trade, which I have closed by means, against the measures of which complaint has been made, and as to which the Hon. Sec't of State has been pleased to say, redress will be made if I fail to justify my acts.
I have stated my grounds upon which my actions proceeded, and the purpose for which it was taken. Of course, to do this work could be of no personal (benefit) to myself, and only entailed great and severe labor.
It was dictated by a sense of duty and upon full and thorough examination I have failed to see any reason why it (should) not be persevered in. But I respectfully submit that it adds not a little to the already everlasting labor of this Department to be continually called upon, months afterwards, to investigate and report upon acts which were within the scope
of my jurisdiction in the fair exercise of the discretion of a Military Commander, and for which I should be called to account not by letter of a Foreign Consular agent on the ex-parte statement of a Spanish smuggler, but by the Commander in Chief of the Army, or the President of the United States, to whom I am as ready to account for my every action as I am to my Country and my God.

Dear Harriet: We are here safe and comfortable, sick five days out of eight. Mr. Butler was rejoiced to see me, and says it is the first time we have been so long apart since we were married, and it shall be the last. He feels more helped and sustained by me than anyone else, though he will not always hear to me. He is not so thin now as he was a month ago, but the climate has told upon him. He does not look so alive as he has before, but the cold weather may bring back the old fiery look. I have written a very long letter to Fisher, which I should like him to read to you, as have not time to go through it again, and it will tell you the appearance of things here. Mr. Butler has sent to his mother a service of silver, four pieces, he bought it by weight. There has been so much talk, I would not say much about it if I were her, for envy makes people bitter. Read this to her, and leave it to her own discretion. There is nothing to conceal, but envious minds will not believe so. You need not read her all the letter. In fact, I do not know if it is worth speaking of it at all. Mr. Butler has also sent by the ""Saxon"" a cup and saucer and plate with his picture painted on them -- no doubt you have them before now. One of these days I shall find something handsome for you. There will be a great many things sold at auction before long. Re-inclose and send back my letters from Mr. Butler that you have received since I left. He says he sent for linen for shirts. Send out a piece and enough for bosoms of a finer quality. He wants the nuns to work them. Put them in some old trunk or buy a cheap one, and two or three pretty looking calico dress-patterns, also his dressing gown. If you happen to be in Boston, buy enough black silk like my dress for a sash. Fisher I think will come out. Perhaps you might find a sash ready made. I am so tired writing eight pages to Fisher that there is nothing in this letter, and now I must write to Blanche. Dear love to the children, and relatives.

Hon. S. P. Chase, Secretary of the Treasury
Sir: I have taken the liberty to address you directly upon this matter which seems to be more appropriate to the Treasury than to the War Department. As you are aware, from
the time that I came here I have endeavored in every possible way to open trade in cotton through the rebel lines. I have supposed that this was consonant with the wish of the Government. Owing to the peculiar action of the Confederate authorities, I have not been able as yet much to succeed. The difficulty has been, as I believe, not so much with the Confederate authorities as in the peculiar relation they find themselves with their own people. They instructed and advised their people to burn their cotton, and those who did do so will not now permit their more prudent neighbors to ship that which had not been destroyed, at an enormous profit. These difficulties are gradually being smoothed over. I think now that the trade can be opened, but am in doubt as to the interpretation of your Treasury Circular.
As early as the 29th of July I forwarded a communication to the Commanding officer at Mobile, a copy of which is enclosed. That communication has since been forwarded to Richmond, and formally sanctioned by the appointment of Commissioners by the Confederate Government. Shall I get out the cotton on the basis proposed? Of course, I shall let all cotton come out under the arrangement which may offer before I hear from the government.
I desire a reply, therefore, by return mail. While this letter is being copied, I have received from Admiral Farragut the enclosed instructions of the Secretary of the Navy. Whether these have been had upon full consideration of the subject set forth above, I do not know. If literally carried out, they would starve the neighboring country, and would greatly embarrass us here for supplies of lumber, wood, naval stores, and fresh provisions. We have to get these through the rivers and over the lakes in exchange for provisions. I do not mean to make this a matter of favoritism; that is not the way the war is carried on here. I desire but to carry out the policy as I supposed of the Government, and administer to our necessities. I have no personal wish on the subject. It becomes, therefore, of the utmost importance to know exactly what the Government desires, and I need not assure you that I shall govern myself with strictness by its directions.
Acting under this same policy, I allowed the ""West Florida"" to go out to Sabine Pass, having cleared for Matamoras with a cargo not contraband of war for the purpose of bringing cotton from Texas. She belonged to a loyal citizen, and in order that there might be no mistake, I gave the permit, a
copy of which is enclosed. The ""West Florida"" has been detained and sent to Pensacola. You will remember that I published a correspondence with the Hon. Reverdy Johnson upon this subject of cotton, and I learned that it had been approved by the State Department through a letter to General Shepley, Military Governor. May I ask your intervention to have the ""West Florida"" released, whatever may be the decision of the Government as to her proceeding on her voyage.
You will see that by the form of the letter it was to go to the Admiral for the purpose of preventing all misunderstandings. It is impossible to overrate the importance of this question of obtaining a supply of cotton to the Northern manufacturers, to say nothing of the effect on European powers; infinitely of more importance to get the cotton for sails and tents than whether A or B loses or gains in the exchange of commodities.
Being purchased in this manner prevents the Jews from gathering up all the gold in the country to exchange it with the Confederates for cotton. The day of cotton-burning is past. I have the honor to be,
Most truly Yours,

Navy Department, Sept. 21, 1862 Rear Admiral D. G. Farragut, Commanding Western Gulf Blockade
Sir: Hereafter you will allow no vessel to import or export merchandise at any port of the blockaded country. New Orleans is the only port open for general traffic within the limits of the Western Gulf Blockading Squadron.
You will not regard what are called ""permits"" from any officer except the Secretaries of the Treasury, War, or Navy as authorizing the ingress or egress of any vessel in violation of the blockade.
There must be no favoritism or license given to any one or more of our countrymen to traffic within the blockaded region, or to import or export merchandise. That would be justly considered as evasive of the blockade and in bad faith.
No officer of the Army or Navy is authorized to grant permits, and you will seize all vessels engaged in illegal traffic.
Such vessels as under the authority of the War or Navy Departments may be engaged to carry supplies to the Army or Navy will take no return cargo.

large claims against the United States for negroes and other property. Upon the receipt of the memorial, as you will see by the endorsement upon it, I ordered an immediate report to be made by Col. Thomas, who commanded the expedition complained of, of all the facts and circumstances. It will be seen by his report, which I doubt not is correct, that there is no claim against the United States from Mr. Bougère for anything, and that his assumed neutrality, like most of the neutrality in this Department, is simply a cover for most bitter hostility.
I was somewhat surprised to find a claim made for negro slaves as property, by a French citizen, for I had believed that the Code Civile forbids the acquisition of such property. The statement made by Bougère that he acquired all these negroes since 1848 is not true. The French Consul did not call on me except in the manner which you see, and I enclose to you my answer.

Maj. Gen'l. H. W. Halleck, Commander in Chief
General: While I have the honor to report a reasonable degree of health on the part of my troops through the summer, and an entire absence of epidemic here, I think it would be well, in view of the coming summer, to change the regiments for the coming season, and for that purpose it will be necessary to begin now, to prevent disarranging the service. I find those necessarily left on the lines at Carrollton suffering greatly from the malarious swamp fever to which the debilitating effect of summer predisposes them. To my astonishment, and against all theory, the regiment of acclimated Louisianans, which I have recruited here, and one of the most healthy I had when in Barracks, sent there, supposing them able to resist the effect of the malaria because of their acclimatization, have suffered from the swamp fever the most considerable of any, much more than the fresh troops -- the seventy-fifth New York, which I brought from the healthy lands of Pensacola and placed in the same locality.
I have the honor to report two regiments of native Guards (colored) organized and mustered into the service, and one takes the field to-morrow.
I have organized an expedition consisting of a Brigade,
five regiments of infantry, two Batteries of Artillery, and four Comp. of Cavalry, under the Command of Brig. Gen'l. Weitzel, to move upon the Western Bank of the Mississippi through Western Louisiana for the purpose of dispersing the forces assembled there under Gen'l. Rich'd. Taylor.
I propose at the same time to send round some light-draught steamers which I have been fitting for the service by protecting their boilers and engines with iron coverings, so as to prevent possibly the recurrence of the dreadful accident which occurred on the ""Mound City"" steamer by the penetration of her boilers by shot, and mounting them by light guns, to attack some Batteries on Berwicks Bay, to penetrate the waters of the Bay and tributaries, and cut off the supplies of cattle for the Rebel Army from Texas via Opelousas and New Iberia, and to act in conjunction with Brig. Gen'l. Weitzel. At the same time, I push forward columns from Algiers, consisting of the 8th Vermont Vols. and the first regiment Native Guards (colored), along the Opelousas Rail Road to Thibodeau and Brashier City, upon the Railway, for the purpose of forwarding supplies to Gen'l. Weitzel's expedition, and to give the loyal planters an opportunity to forward their sugar and cotton to this city. I can easily hold this portion of Louisiana, by far the richest, and extend the movement so far as substantially to cut off all supplies from Texas to the country this coming winter by this route, if I can receive only reinforcements. Please therefore send me New England troops. The newspapers assure me that there are thousands waiting in Massachusetts. Letters from their Officers are received by me begging that they may come to this Department. Of course, I have a preference for Massachusetts troops. Those that I have here behaved very well. I trust that they may be sent to me. I should be glad if General Weitzel should be able to move upon Texas, and would suggest that an appropriate base of operation would be through Galveston, which I have just learned has surrendered to the Naval force of the Union. But I have hardly got a regiment which I can spare, to hold it, although I propose to send one. Not that I anticipate an immediate attack upon New Orleans, nor that I fear it unless I am forced to receive the débris of the South Western wing, after the defeat of Bragg, by General Buell, when, if I weaken myself here, I may invite attack from such sources.
Rear Admiral Farragut is very desirous that we should make a demonstration on Mobile, or at least Fort Morgan,
to save the necessity of the large blockading force off that port. I think 3000 men more would do it successfully, but again I have not the men to spare, and to do those things which I think of more immediate necessity.
I have as yet received, with the exception of sixty men, no recruits from the North for any of my old Regiments, some of which have been eighteen (18) months in service, so that my regiments appear much larger in number than they are in effective strength. I am sorry to report the very sudden and serious illness of Brig. Gen'l. Arnold, who was stricken with paralysis while attending a review on Saturday, from which I think he will not recover sufficiently to resume his duties for some months.
I was happy to receive the commendations of the General-in-Chief of the action of Maj. Strong at Pontchatoula. The illness of General Arnold and the wide-spread districts over which my troops are disposed makes it necessary that I should have another Brig. Gen'l. Allow me to recommend for promotion Maj. Strong, my Asst. Adjt. Gen'l., Lieut. in the Ordnance Corps, who graduated the second in his class at West Point in 1857, and also has been in the service ever since. I know no one more competent, and certainly none has shown better conduct and gallantry.
I have been obliged to lose his services a part of the summer through his illness brought on by over-exertion, in preparing this expedition to New Orleans, but I think he has manfully recovered and reëstablished his health. May I ask your kind offices to recommend to the President the appointment as one eminently fit to be made. I have the honor to be,

I have received the enclosure of the acting French Minister in regard to the capture of the ""Tennessee.""
The ""Tennessee"" was a steamer belonging to the house of Chas. Morgan & Co., of New York, actually in the possession of one Harris here, a rebel, was used, as I am informed, in attempting to run the blockade, was captured by the Navy under the French Flag, and I am not certain but an English
one. At least, it had pretended French and English owners. It was sold after the city was actually invested, and while we were preparing an attack upon the forts, the cotton which had been placed on board to run the blockade having been landed before the fleet arrived off the city.
English and French flags have been used very liberally here to cover all manner of property, and generally most used by them who have the least right to them. I at once forwarded the communication from the Acting French Minister to Rear Admiral Farragut, and I enclose his report. The Steamer is now in the service of the fleet as a tender to the squadron.

Sir: In reply to your letter desiring to learn all I know of the capture of the ""Tennessee,"" I have to state that perhaps no vessel is better known to the blockading force before New Orleans than the ""Tennessee.""
She has been blockaded and watched for many months, during which time she has been frequently down to the ""passes"" loaded with cotton, and ready to run the blockade, and has been as frequently compelled to return.
When I captured New Orleans I found the ""Tennessee"" lying at the wharf with a French Flag hoisted somewhere on the vessel, indicating that she belonged to a French subject, but her antecedents were too well-known to me to regard any such evidence of ownership, as I knew that if any such transfer had been made it had been done within a very short period of time, and during the blockade, which, according to my understanding, is contrary to all law.

Brig. General Neal Dow, Commanding Pensacola
General: I was very much surprised and grieved, and the public service was considerably interfered with, by your detention of the ""St. Mary's."" Indeed, it would have been better for the service to have lost the ""Creole"" than to have suffered the delay. The steamer was sent to Pensacola for special service, with written orders under my own hand, for the utmost despatch, and in such case the boat must never be interfered with. It has been informally reported to me that your expedition was sent for furniture up the Blackwater. If that was necessary for the comfortable occupation of your quarters, of course I should not seriously object, but the fewer of such expeditions the better.
I cannot permit the shipping of furniture or other articles North by any officer for his own use. Such taking of private property, whether belonging to rebels or others, comes under the order of the War Department, No. 107, a copy of which I send you, and is there denominated ""plundering."" If in your judgment any property should belong, or does belong, to the United States, and can be better disposed of North than here, and should be properly shipped and sold, you will take the same course I did with the bells captured at New Orleans, -- send it to the United States Quarter Master at Boston or New York, to be disposed of on account of the Government, but upon no consideration, and under no pretence, upon the private account of an officer. I must of course submit these matters with these instructions to the discretion of an officer as high in command as yourself, not doubting that it will be properly used.
I have put the ""Sykes"" as a despatch and mail-boat to run between Pensacola and here in order that there may be frequent and regular communications between Pensacola, Ship Island, Fort Pike, and this point. You will see to it that she is used for no other purpose. Her regular days of sailing from here will be Wednesdays and Saturdays. Her time should regularly be thirty hours. You will appoint such hours for leaving Pensacola as will best enable her to make her return trip, and that hour must not be interfered with after being appointed except to save life, or from the necessity of the public service in case of attack.
I am informed that a quantity of pitch was taken under my permission from Pensacola and brought here. It was necessary for the use of the Navy. This is claimed by one Harrison, who was engineer or employee of the Rosin Oil Works at Pensacola. He has two hundred barrels of pitch there secreted somewhere in the woods. You will find him at once, and cause the pitch he has to be delivered at the Navy Yard, turning it over to Rear Admiral Farragut, asking his receipt therefor. Please inform by return of the ""Sykes"" if this can be done, because otherwise I must send pitch for the use of the Navy on the next trip of the ""Sykes.""
Lt. Col. Dyer has forwarded me, without your approval, an application for the resignation of the Adjutant of his Regiment, accompanied by charges as a reason for his resignation, that he was drunk on duty. An honorable discharge of an officer, consequent upon acceptance of a resignation, is the adjudication of the Commanding General that he has faithfully and properly served his country, and is entitled to her thanks, her honor, and her rewards. How could Col. Dyer believe that such discharge could be granted to a man who deserved dismissal from the service? I have therefore ordered Adjutant Nowland to be dropped from the rolls, assuming the statement of Col. Dyer to be true, as it seems to be made in a friendly spirit, and as no other reasons for the resignation are forwarded by him.
I wish you to make me a full report in detail of the transactions which led to the detention of the ""St. Mary's,"" the cause of the detention, and of the orders that caused it. I have the honor to be,

Sir: I had the pleasure to receive your despatch announcing the great favor you have done me in detailing Officers King & Cook to the command of my boats. They go off to-morrow morning, and I trust will be in Berwicks Bay on Monday. The expedition to Donaldsonville started to-day. As soon as we get through with this little job I will send over the same troops and light-draught steamer to coöperate with you. I think I will spare a Regiment & some pieces of Artillery to hold Galveston if that will be sufficient. I have not sufficient information as to the number of troops required for that purpose. I never was more astonished in my life than on receiving your letter about the pitch. The history of the transaction is this. Some person came to me and asked for a permit to bring over his property on shore. It never occurred to me that it was pitch or anything that you would want; and the permit was a general one. There are, however, two hundred Bbls. more pitch left in Pensacola which I will order seized and brought to you at the Navy Yard, and if it is reported to me by General Dow that this cannot be done, I will see that sufficient for your use is sent from here. Please indicate how much pitch and how much rosin you want by the return of the ""Sykes."" When, by any act of mine, I paralyze the operation of the Navy, I paralyze my own right arm, and it has been a source of grief to me that you should even think for the days you are waiting this reply that I knew anything of this transaction. I send you by the ""Sykes"" 20 Bbls of rosin which I seized at Fort Pike. I can forward you tar and pitch from here if you do not get the pitch I have mentioned. I have ordered the ""Sykes"" to act as a despatch boat between this Post, Ship Island & Pensacola. She runs about fourteen miles an hour, and as she was fired into three times by the Blockading Squadron, and dodged the shells, and the Capt. does not like to repeat the experiment, if you will give her a number that she may carry at night and distribute it among your Squadron we shall save accidents. I don't blame the Officers for shooting. After the fate of Preble I would not let anything pass me if I were they. You know I believe in shooting when anybody attempts to run past. As she is a Despatch Boat, may I
ask that your Officers shall not detain her, because I wish for all our sakes that she should make regular trips. She will leave here every Saturday and Wednesday afternoon at 4 o'clock, and on corresponding days from Pensacola at such hour as may give her the best despatch. I think if you will give her your mail I can manage with the Postmaster so as to give you more frequent communication with the North than in any other way.
Mrs. Butler, who has come out, sends her best regards. She has a right lively recollection of many kindnesses from yourself & Officers of your command.

General: I immediately, on the receipt of your order of the 25th, relating to pitch, caused explanations to be made, and the result is that a quantity has been found in a hole in the sand. It was run in warm, and is very much mixed with dirt. I have communicated with the Admiral on the subject, and shall have it melted and dipped off into barrels, free from foreign matters.
The quantity is not yet ascertained, nor do I know the quality -- but shall probably be informed of that to-morrow I hope there will be as much as the Admiral will need.

To the Hon. E. M. Stanton
I HAVE the honor to report that I have forwarded on the Steamer ""Catawba,"" under the charge of Capt. Puffer, certain discharged soldiers, three insane men, and three clergymen of the Protestant Episcopal Church. I have directed the three clergymen to be turned over to the care of the United States Marshal at New York, subject to the order of the War Department.
The insane men Capt. Puffer will take with him to Washington, and deliver to the ""Soldiers Insane Asylum.""
One of the clergymen, the Rev. Dr. Leacock, preached a
sermon on the 29th of Nov. 1860, which was afterwards published and run through four editions of about 30,000 copies. I enclose the vital extracts. You will see that it was highly incendiary in its nature. He is an Englishman born, but I believe has been naturalized in this country, at any rate I have his written admission that he does not claim British protection. He has been in New Orleans about six years, and I think has been an emissary of the British Government. And the Rev. Mr. Fulton is a clergyman who was for a considerable time a private in the Rebel army. And the Rev. Mr. Goodrich has been an active and violent secessionist.
All these men refused to take the oath of allegiance, and though the Military Governor of Louisiana, Genl. Shepley, ordered that they should read the service adopted by the Protestant Episcopal Church in the United States, including the prayer for the President of the United States, they have neglected to obey the order, and though warned of the consequences of disobeying the order, they have still contumaciously refused to obey it. I think them much more mischievous in this city than they would be as soldiers in arms in the Confederate Service. And I send them to Fort Lafayette, so that they will at least be out of mischief during the remainder of the war.
The only excuse they have to make to me in personal examination is that the Diocesan Bishop, I believe the Right Rev. Warrior Bishop Gen. Polk, has prescribed a different form of service, and that they are therefore canonically obliged to disobey the orders of the authorities here.
Any other information about this, if desired by the Department, will be forwarded if directed. I have the honor to be,

General Orders No. 85
The Commanding General has examined the doings of the Court Martial whereof Major Peck was President, with care. While there seems to have been a good degree of discrimination in weighing the evidence, and the proceedings are reasonably regular, yet it is apparent that the Court, in the sentences and punishments, were entirely regardless of their duty. Offenses that should have been punished with death, or the severest prison discipline for life, have been given the farcical punishment of two or three months' confinement and a small fine. Sleeping on post by a sentinel in face of an enemy, an offense justly punishable with death, as the safety of a whole army may depend on his vigilance, is punished by ""three weeks' confinement in a guard tent."" Going to sleep in his quarters by an officer of the guard is punished by loss of one month's pay and a reprimand from the Commander of the post, and this officer recommended to the mercy of the Commanding General because of his ignorance. Striking and violent abuse of an officer by a soldier has had a short term of imprisonment and a small fine, less than would have been given by a civil court for an ordinary assault and battery. Perhaps this may be accounted for by the fact that the members of the Court knew exactly how much a man ought to be punished if he abused one of them. Other officers, of a different and proper appreciation of their own position and merit, would have come to a different conclusion.
The sentences of the Court, as a rule, are a disgrace to every officer composing it. The Court Martial of which Major Frank H. Peck is President, is dissolved.

Dear Harriet: A vessel goes out this afternoon; no more for a week. The weather is quite cold; we have fires all over
the house. Yesterday Mr. Butler and I dined with four of the Staff who are keeping Bachelors' Hall. They gave us a very nice dinner, and on the whole it was quite pleasant. We expect Fisher soon as he receives news that he is to come. The articles sent home, including Mrs. Read's ring, were bought of a Jew Broker, and cost twelve hundred dollars, bought just as you would buy them of a broker in Boston, Mrs. Butler's silver at the same place. This I write only because we had spoken of it, and I thought you might like to know. Of course, you would make it no subject of conversation to anyone else. Maria has gone into a very fine house, Harry has left us and gone to her. The things that Mr. Butler sent for in his letter to me, get together if you can and send by Fisher. If there is room in the trunk, put in the box that contains my muff and mufties. It will be cold enough for furs. I should like well enough a few yards of bright ribbon to give to the servants, or a gay handkerchief to tie over their heads, but you need not trouble much about it. I cannot write you much to interest today, for I seem to have my head more than full about matters, that I will write to you of when I get them arranged. You have the steam on by this time. I hope you are all well, and that you will manage to make it cheerful and pleasant. I shall be glad to hear how Lote's affairs progress. Fisher was better pleased with it than he would have been with the other, of the same name, though he says he knows nothing about this man. But he is a pleasant person, and I hope for Lote's sake it will be all right. I hope you have already written, and that I shall get a letter in the course of a week.

My dear Sir: I am always disinclined to make complaint of the action of any officer, especially one of your squadron, but I think I must submit to you the enclosed report and correspondence, because it is right that the Quarter Master at Ship Island, Lt. Ring, should have some voucher so that he may not be at the personal loss of the value of the cattle mentioned.
Upon request, Captain Guest should have had the cattle; but I don't think that upon reflection Capt. Guest would desire that the Qr. Master should be at the personal loss, as he must be if no receipt is furnished. I have the honor to be,
Your respl. servant,

Office Chief Commissary of Subsistence, Dept. of the Gulf, New Orleans
To Major Gen. Butler, Com'g Dept. of the Gulf
General: I have the honor to enclose herewith the certificate of Lt. Aaron Ring, 13th Me. Vols., setting forth the facts of the seizure of six beef cattle, for which he was responsible, by Capt. Guest, U. S. N., of the U. S. S. ""Owasco,"" and a letter of Capt. Guest in reply when called upon for receipt of the cattle.
These cattle were sent to Ship Island by my direction, being obtained at considerable expense, and sent over there with much trouble and labor for the use of troops stationed in that island.
The extenuation offered by Capt. Guest, that he thought them wild cattle, appears ridiculous in the face of the fact that some 13,000 troops occupied the Island for three or four months, and were for most of the time suffering for the want of fresh beef; moreover, it is not likely that expeditions would have been sent off, as was done, to visit neighboring islands for the very purpose of procuring cattle for the troops, not wild cattle but animals left there to graze, when beef cattle were roaming around on Ship Island. That the cattle were not in the lines of the command is very probable. The grazing on Ship Island at best is very scarce, and to have kept them within the limited lines of the two companies would have been to have kept them to starve; and what dangers were there to apprehend when our own naval vessels were in the vicinity for the protection of public property?
It is a fact that we are feeding negroes and vagabond males and females who misbehave in New Orleans; why we are doing so is not for me, a subordinate officer, to question. It is done, though, with a due accountability for every thing so expended, and I do not understand why this is a warrant for the forcible seizure of public property by Capt. Guest to hand over to persons in no manner connected with either Army or Navy. A
distressed condition of his own case might justify him in the taking of public property in this manner, but to be accounted for afterwards to the responsible officer.
It appears to be a wanton act when Capt. Guest admits that his own crew did not want it, nor get any of it, and when called upon for the proper receipts tells the public officer who is responsible to his Government for that property, that he may charge it to ""profit and loss.""
I submit this to you, seeking redress for Lt. Ring and exemption if possible from having stores, gathered at no small pains and labor for the use of your army, thus forcibly taken and used for no purpose connected with the operations of this command. I am,

Dear Sir: I have just received your letter of this day making an inquiry of me in reference to some beef cattle killed by my crew on the eastern end of this island. It is true that a boat's-crew from this vessel did kill six beef cattle on the upper end of Ship Island one day last week.
I am not sure they killed cattle belonging to the Army, as I have been told there are or were a number of wild cattle on the island, and if they did belong to the Army, my men did not know it. The facts in the case are these: Capt. Woodworth of the ""Jackson"" brought some sheep here from Pensacola for the use of our vessels. The sheep escaped from the pen, and when my men went in quest of them, were stopped by your pickets.
I was therefore obliged to get under-way and to land my men outside of your lines. I told them to look for the sheep, and kill as many as they could, as I considered them lost. They saw the sheep but could shoot none. They saw cattle and killed six.
You will permit me to observe that if all the cattle of the island belong to your Qr. Master's Dept. he has no security for them whatever, as any one may land and take them away without his knowledge, and being so far beyond your lines and control my men very naturally concluded them to be wild, especially as they were seen with the lost sheep.
 -- 416  -- As the Supply Steamer was here at the time, my people did not require the beef, so I distributed it among the merchant ships whose crews have no chance to get fresh beef.
I had the pleasure, dear Col., of sending you a quarter of beef, little thinking I might be giving you your own. I hope, however, you found it very tender. As the United States is now feeding every negro that chooses to come to us, and all the vagabonds male and female who misbehave in New Orleans, you perhaps agree with me that the lucky accident which gave a hearty meal to the loyal crews of our merchantmen is not to be regretted.
The Quarter Master will have to charge the beef to ""profit & loss,"" especially the latter. In future I shall confine my riflemen to mutton, when they land on Ship Island, lest they might by chance find an Army beef amongst the wild cattle. I am, dear sir,

Consulate of the U. S. of America at Matamoras, Oct. 3, 1862
I, Consul of the United States of America for the port of Matamoras, Mexico, do hereby certify that the schooner called the ""Planet,"" of Nassau, N. P., of the registered burden of seventy-six tons, whereof J. Chander is master, navigated by six men and having on board twenty-five passengers, being in all thirty-two are persons on board cleared this day from this port for New Orleans. I hereby further certify that in this port and vicinity and among the shipping thereof good health prevails without suspicion of plague, yellow fever, or any contagious or pestilential disease whatever, in either an epidemic or sporadic form, and that no disease has existed either in the place or among the shipping for the past . . . weeks or months.
Given under my hand and seal of this Consular office, the day and year above written.

General: I herewith enclose to you the bill of health for the schooner ""Planet"" from Matamoras, Mexico, and a copy of the letter of Dr. J. A. G. Fisher, the Quarantine physician at the station below New Orleans, dated October 20th, 1862, giving statements of some of the passengers of the schooner ""Planet.""
On the 16th September, 1862, the Mexican schooner ""Iicaltipec"" arrived from Matamoras, Mexico, having a clean bill of health from the U. S. Consul at that port. The schooner had on board six U. S. soldiers -- escaped prisoners from the rebels. On the 21st of September, Dr. Fisher reported that Pat C. Spark of the 8th Infy., who came as a passenger on the ""Iicaltipec,"" was taken sick with yellow fever, and on the 27th September Dr. Fisher reports that this man had died the previous day (the 26th Sept.), black vomit having set in, thus proving to be an unmistakable case of yellow fever, -- still this vessel had a clean bill of health.
Again, on the 16th October, 1862, the schooner ""Planet"" arrived here from Matamoras, having enclosed a clean bill of health from Mr. L. Pierce, Jr., the U. S. Consul at that port, although this vessel had 93 passengers on board from Texas, who stated to Dr. Fisher that yellow fever in an epidemic form existed at Brownsville at the time of their departure.
This has been the second case of a vessel arriving from Matamoras with a clean bill of health from Mr. L. Pierce, Jr., the U. S. Consul, while it is a well-known fact that a severe epidemic of yellow fever existed during this season along the whole coast of Texas and Mexico.

My dear General: The sincerest interest in you prompts this letter. You have done so much and so well, and have been personally so just in your action and expressions towards myself, that I cannot endure the thoughts of your suffering in the present poor opinion as well as in the esteem of the government through the imputed faults of others.
So many and seemingly such well-founded charges against your brother, Col. Butler, have reached me and other members of the administration, as well as the President, that I feel bound to say to you that in my judgment you owe it to yourself not to be responsible, even by toleration, for what he does. Many do not scruple to express their conviction that
you and some other of your officers are concerned in his speculations. Mr. Denison alone of all who have written from New Orleans has repelled the idea of your participation, and even his faith, though he expresses the greatest admiration and regard for you, seems to be shaken in this respect.
I do not presume to suggest any line of action to you. Your own good sense will advise you better than I can.
It is said that Col. Butler's gains amount to between one and two millions of dollars.
Mr. Denison's last letter transmits two permits, one from yourself and one from Gov. Shepley, for trade with the enemy, or rather within the rebel lines. This is expressly forbidden by act of Congress as well as by Regulation. I am glad to have his assurance that no more such permits will be granted. All intercourse across the lines should be confined to military purposes.
I shall look anxiously and hopefully to the result of your expedition up the river. I hope it may add a new laurel to your crown, as well as prove of essential service to our cause. Mr. Denison gives the most interesting and promising accounts of your colored regiment experiment. The only error is that the experiment is begun too late. Long ago we should have received every recruit willing to take arms for the Union in the rebel states, whether black or white, putting them in proper organization, and save as far as possible our labor in the loyal states. The drain in consequence of the neglect of this simple device of prudence upon our labor, and especially our unskilled labor, is frightful. This alone will account for augmented prices of all articles produced by labor.
Yours cordially and faithfully, S. P. Chase"
"November 14, 1862","Headquarters Department of the Gulf, New Orleans, November 14th, 1862
My dear Sir: Your kind and welcome note was received with mingled emotions of pleasure and pain -- pleasure from the friendship which so conspicuously shows through every line, and pain that you, a friend, should think I would permit the wrongs which you sketch to be done not only with my knowledge, but with my sanction. My brother has been indeed engaged in commercial adventure in New Orleans, and has been successful. I know and cannot be mistaken that he
has been no more successful than many others. I believe that every transaction has been legitimate mercantile operations. I have aided him in no way officially. On the contrary, I have avoided it, and have aided him far less than I have strangers, so far as all matters of official action were concerned. I have aided him to capital and credit by the use of my name at the North, and drawing on my bankers where I had some means before this war, but very little now. I have aided him in no other way. I believe this is a legitimate course toward a brother. I have not heard, nor do I believe, that he has done anything which in any way interferes with the Army of the Gulf or with the department. Certain it is that he has supplied the army with nothing or bought anything from it that was not sold at public auction.
That his acts have been misrepresented is most true, and in nothing more than in the extent of his transactions, -- you say you have heard his profits were two millions!!. Why he shew me his balance sheet the 1st of October, and his entire transactions were only rising eight hundred thousand dollars, a large portion of which was in buying sugar here at nearly the same price it sold for in New York, sometimes higher, and depending upon the difference of exchange 12 or 15 per cent for his profits.
How much he has been able to gain you will conjecture. I have not asked him, nor do I believe he knows. That he most carefully bought for the Government, to send home under my direction, some sixty thousand dollars worth of sugar and naval stores, upon which the Government doubled the money, and in payment of which my drafts were suffered to go to protest, is most true, but for that he has never yet received one cent. I asked him to ballast some Government transports, which would otherwise have to go to Ship Island for sand, and the Quartermaster at Boston repudiated his contracts, although thousands of dollars were saved to the Government. A loss was thrown on him by the repudiation, and his name brought into disrepute by the action of Quartermaster's Department.
These are all the acts he has ever done for the Government, and these are the results. I have determined, however, that no appearance of evil shall exist to rob me of the fair earnings of a devotion of life and fortune to the service of my country. I have therefore asked Col. Butler to close up his business and go away from New Orleans, so as to leave me entirely untrammelled to deal with the infernal brood of slandering speculators
who have maligned me because I will not allow them to plunder the Government.
I would desire that every high officer of my command, every quartermaster, commissary, Gov. Shepley, General Weitzel, Sherman, or other officers, might be interrogated as to any act of Col. Butler in his business, and I am willing he should abide the result of the answer.
I have managed the affairs of this department as I would have done my own, and that I have been successful before I entered the service of the country in accumulating a competency for myself is the best guarantee that I know how to manage my own affairs, and I point with a just pride to the records of the commissary, quartermaster's, and treasury for the justification of my administration -- less by more than ten dollars to one as compared with the Port Royal expedition, which was just about the same size. And much less than any other expedition of the equal size.
Besides, I have fed more than thirty thousand whites and ten thousand blacks for more than five months, and have put into the Treasury of the United States more than three quarters of a million of dollars.
I have a right to say this to a friend, and take the privilege to do so. As to the matter of the passes of merchandise to get cotton, I have fully informed the department upon that subject. It was brought to the notice of the State Department and approved, and submitted to Hon. Reverdy Johnson at the time, and approved by him, and this was the only evidence I had it was wrong until I got your note.
Certain it is that by allowing some provisions to go across the lake to the starving people there, we have caused an insurrection at Jackson, Mississippi, against the Confederate Government, because they would not allow the cotton to go out to pay for them. Upon examination of the ""regulations of the Treasury,"" however, the most stringent rules in conformity therewith were adopted.
My experiment of arming the free negroes is succeeding admirably. Two regiments are already doing service in the field in guarding the Opelousas Railroad, and are doing it as well as any soldiers can. That they will fight I do not doubt. I am much in need of reinforcements -- not to hold this place, but to do anything with service to the country. I can take Mobile if I have 10,000 men to do it with, aye, I will try with seven. I have now scarcely 10 thousand effective
men in the department, and I could not have moved as I have were it not for my negro recruits.
You will find enclosed the order, No. 91, that I have issued in regard to the property in the Lafourche county. I will get a million of dollars worth of property, at least, for the Government, if some commissioner is not sent down here to give it up. Mr. Johnson's visit here cost the Government $405,000 in gold, which has been since sent out to pay for army clothing for the Rebels. It is all told in my despatches to the War Department. Do pray send me some men. I will take Texas if you will send any men. I have not 2000 now in the city of New Orleans, nor five within striking distance."

General: I have received your report of the 28 & 29th inst., the last enclosing a list of killed and wounded. I cannot speak too highly of the admirable conduct of your troops, and your own brilliant success in the expedition.
I have pushed forward the opening of the road as vigorously as possible. Col. Stafford left Wednesday afternoon, with timber sufficient, as he said, to repair the bridge at Bayou des Allemands, and he assured me that he would be able to do it in two days or three at the outside. I have directed Col. Thomas by the same messenger to push forward the bulk of
his regiment as fast as he can repair the track, and to join you at Thibodeaux. Your requisition shall be filled and forwarded at the earliest possible moment.
Buchanan was to have made his attack on Tuesday at Berwicks, with what success of course I cannot say as yet. We were delayed three days by a most terrific storm which disabled the ""Diana,"" but I have got her in working order, and she has gone round.
I have ordered over the Second Native Guards (colored), who will hold the road while Stafford pushes on to Thibodeaux. I sympathize with you in the matter of the negroes. By the Act of Congress they are clearly free, still you must not encumber yourself with them. Make them stop at Thibodeaux, from whence, when we get ears running, we can transport them to Algiers if necessary. If they pillage, of course we cannot help it. It is one of the necessary evils following this system of labor, and the rebellion, as far as I can see.
Everything is quiet here. We have had no arrivals from the north. Through secret channels we learn that Bragg has evacuated Kentucky. The elections in Ohio, Pennsylvania, and Indiana have been in favor of the Democracy, so secesh reports; but with this we have nothing to do, as I suppose it will not affect the prosecution of the war.
Push in to Brashier City as soon as possible, to be able to act in conjunction with Buchanan. I have a despatch from Col. Holcomb at Donaldsonville. He reports everything quiet there. The ""Essex"" has gone up there.

Translation. New Orleans, Oct. 31st, 1862 Maj. Gen. B. F. Butler, Com'g Army of the Gulf,
New Orleans
Sir: I have just been informed that by virtue of an order issued by the Provost Marshal General, Col. French, and approved by you, ten bales of blankets belonging to Messrs. Barriere Bros., French merchants, residing in this city, have been taken away from the custom house, where these goods were stored, without even informing the owners thereof.
This arbitrary act is more than an attempt against the property of the French citizen, it is flagrant violation of a trust confided to the good faith of the United States under the flag floating over the Custom House, and placed under the protection of the Head of the Custom House Administration.
In the midst of your important occupations the gravity of this fact was without doubt not presented to your mind, and I hope these remarks will be sufficient to induce you to order the restitution of the goods thus illegally seized.
If a violation of a trust is by itself not justifiable, it is the more so by the fact that Messrs. Barriere Bros. have not been advised of what was intended and accomplished.
All the important importers are interested in this question. The commerce cannot exist without security, and how can business in New Orleans, already so dull, take a rise, which was formerly characteristic of this city, if one is exposed to see his goods, confided to the Custom House, seized without notice, without reason, or right. Already Messrs. Barriere have been victims of a seizure in their stores in Canal St., a seizure executed under a promise of early payment, which has been delayed until the time when the war should be over, which delay is admissible, as it might be only the result of a contract between both parties, and Messrs. Barriere are not willing to submit to this.
I beg you therefore, General, to order the restitution of the goods seized from the Depot of the Custom House, and belonging to Messrs. Barriere Bros., as well as the immediate payment
of those which have been taken from their store by order, if I am right, of the Surgeon General of the Army. Please accept the assurance of my high consideration.
Count Mejan, Consul of France
Head Quarters Department of the Gulf, New Orleans, Nov. 1, 1862
Count Mejan, Consul of France
Sir: I have your letter of Oct. 31 in regard to the taking by the United States authorities of the blankets of Mr. Barriere & Co. Mr. Barriere has misinformed and misled you by the statement that they were taken without information to him. The Medical Director of the Department had need of the blankets for the sick in Hospital. The sudden appearance of cold weather and the delay of steamers from the North had rendered the supply insufficient.
It became, then, a necessity that blankets should be procured. Mr. Barriere had almost the only blankets of which we knew. The Medical Director called upon him and desired to purchase the blankets. He refused to sell them unless he could be paid money in hand at an exorbitant price. He was informed that the money would soon be paid at fair price. He then peremptorily refused to sell. Therefore, yielding to the inexorable law of necessity, I directed the blankets to be taken for the purpose indicated for military purposes, and should have done the same thing had they belonged to the most loyal citizen of the United States.
I know of no treaty or obligation of national courtesy that requires the French citizen to be put, in time of war at least, upon any better or different footing than the citizen of the Government in which he finds himself, in regard to matters of trade, commerce, and property. I do not now advert to rules which may govern military service. A receipt was given Messrs. Barriere & Bros. for the blankets as soon as an account of them could be taken, in form given to loyal citizens of the United States, as a voucher by the Gov't. and in the usual course of business. I would have directed a payment to be made to him at the earliest possible moment. But I am now hindered from so doing from the tone and demands of your letter. You do not demand payment -- you demand restitution of the article. This last will not be acceded to. The blankets are now covering sick and wounded soldiers, whose interest I must care for before those of commerce, which of course lie more near the heart of a commercial agent.
 -- 434  -- I beg leave to suggest to the French Consul that words of characterization of my acts, such as ""arbitrary and flagrant violation of trusts,"" are not worthy a place in a correspondence between himself and the Chief of this Department. The act was not arbitrary, otherwise than all acts necessary for military purposes are so. The taking of the blankets for military purposes was no violation of trust. The United States Government was responsible for them before they were taken; the same Government is responsible for them now.
I trust and believe that these objectionable expressions in the note of the French Consul were inadvertent, and I need not say they will not be repeated in official correspondence with me.
The authorities of the United States have endeavored to forward the interests of commerce almost to the exclusion of other matters, and that the commerce of Louisiana has not been fully opened to the world is not the fault of the Federal Government. Their safeguard has been given it, their protection afforded, and that safeguard and that protection has in no just sense of the term ever been violated. I am grieved that the French Consul has chosen to take this course upon this matter, as now the necessary correspondence with the authorities at Washington will delay Barriere Bros. in getting their pay for the blankets, which I should have been glad to have given them had I felt at liberty to do so after the French Consul's communication. I beg leave to say to the French consul, as an evidence of the necessity which compelled me to take the blankets, that they were of so poor a quality that had I any choice left me I would neither take them or purchase them. Brought to Havana for the purpose of being imported into the rebel states through the blockade, as I am informed and think I am able to prove, they were only saved by the vigilance of our cruisers from being now in the rebel cause, toward which the proclivities of the Messrs. Barriere Bros. are as well-known as in their former trade with the rebels.
Still, having been brought here since the opening of the port, I should have overlooked the purpose for which they were originally taken to Havana, and pay for them if the French Consul had left me at liberty to do so. I have the honor to be,

General: In obedience to your instructions I report that on Tuesday, 28th of October ult., I called on Messrs. Barriere Brothers to purchase some blankets for the Medical Department of the Army, most urgently necessary for the health, and in some cases even the lives of the soldiers of your Army and although I had frequently made purchases for the Army in years past from these same gentlemen, and always heretofore received from them most cheerfully what I might need, and paid them subsequently after a longer or shorter credit, to my great surprise they positively refused to let me have the blankets I so urgently needed except upon paying cash before delivery, and not having the money on hand and not having been able to find the requisite number of blankets elsewhere, I was compelled to seek the advice of Col. French, Provost Marshal General, and yourself, or else to permit the sick confided to my charge to suffer greatly, many of them even unto death, by failing to procure these blankets.
In a conversation with Mr. Barriere since, in my office and in the presence of my steward, he, Mr. Barriere, admitted his knowledge of me as a government agent and our former transactions, and his entire satisfaction with me in all our previous business affairs.
The collector sent Messrs. Barriere Brothers a verbal instead of written notice in reference to the seizure of his blankets. Before and since taking these blankets, in the most emphatic manner I reminded Mr. Barriere that the Government did not want his goods without paying for them.
In conclusion, I beg leave to say that I gave him a certificate
in accordance with orders of War Department dated July 22nd, 1862, upon which he will receive payment.

Sir: The importance of the subject must be the excuse for my addressing you.
Meeting Mr. Theo. Soniat yesterday, he requested me to ascertain whether the authorities would allow him to take his crop off with hired labor. He admitted not having taken the oath. It would be impossible for him to get pecuniary assistance or even labor without your permission, and nearly all the other plantations in my neighborhood are in the same situation, even if having taken the oath. I do not know what your policy in regard to this state of affairs is, or what the government intends to do, but wish to save as much as possible to the government, and the time to do so with the sugar crops has arrived. In South Carolina, the crops were saved for govt. account at very heavy expenses. I would propose to do so at a certain percentage-account, of which all the expense for labor, feeding, managing, should be paid, and the clear surplus might be subject to a future decision of the Government, if the owner is disloyal, and to a loyal owner at once. The amount of percentage would depend on the facilities granted by you to employ the contrabands, to be paid for their labor, and fed out of the above percentage, which, in such an instance, I would be willing to do for 25%. This would relieve the government of supporting the contrabands, would teach them that hereafter they must support themselves, induce men to try to raise their crops with hired labor, and be beneficial all around. Not knowing whether anything of this kind of arrangement would receive your approbation, I have not tried to ascertain whether the planters would consent, but doubt not that the loyal ones would. The disloyal ones, if not agreeing, a provisional seizure might be necessary.
Being lately engaged in superintending the building the new levee between Carrollton and the Parapet, under the supervision of Capt. Bailey of 4th Wisconsin V. Regt., a force of
about 300 contrabands have been organized and employed, and the levee will be finished in about one week. It strikes me that this force might be profitably and usefully employed for the object of saving sugar crops to the amount of 800 to 1000 Hhds., and 1500 bbls. of molasses, on some such terms as above mentioned, before the 1st January. If anything can be saved out of the percentage it should go to the benefit of the manager. In securing the sugar crops, female contrabands can be employed to nearly half the force.
Submitting the above to your consideration, I have the honor to be,

General: Your despatch of November first is received. As I informed you in my last, I have sent forward both Regiments of Native Guards (colored) to guard the road. I have no doubt that before this reaches you Col. Thomas and Col. Stafford will have reported to you. They will receive your orders. We had already taken measures about the organizations of the management of the Opelousas R. Road. Of course there will be no more difficult subject for you to deal with than the negroes. By the Act of Congress, independent of the President's proclamation, having come from rebel masters into our lines, in occupation of rebel territory since the passage of that act, they are free. But the question recurs. What shall we do with them? While we have no right to return them to their masters, as such, it is our duty to take care of them, and that can include employment. Put them as far as possible upon plantations, use every energy to have the sugar crop made and preserved for the owners that are loyal, and for the United States when the owners are disloyal. I am working the plantations along the river below on this plan. Let the loyal planters make arrangements to pay their negroes $10, a month for able-bodied men, $3. to be expended in clothing, and so in proportion. Disembarrass your Army of them as much as possible. Especially will this be necessary in the case of Col. Stafford's Command.
I have information more or less reliable that there were about 8000 troops at Port Hudson, Pontchatoula and Camp Moore, about equally divided among the three, on the 27th of October. My impression is that they have gone North. Bragg is undoubtedly badly beaten, and is in full retreat. There has been no battle since the 9th at Perryville, up to the 16th. We have Northern dates to the 16th. Nothing new on the Potomac. I enclose you some of the latest newspapers with this despatch. In regard to disarming the people, every disloyal person must be disarmed. And I do not mean by loyalty ""lip service."" And we must leave force enough to take care of any rising of the negroes. I think you had better see the more intelligent of the negroes in person, and assure them that all acts of Congress and laws in their favor will be carried out to them with the same effect if they remain on the
plantations and the work, as if they came into camp. And caution them that there must be no violence to unarmed and quiet persons.
You had better send back a train of extra Artillery and Cavalry horses and mule wagons to Algiers on a march, without waiting for the Rail Road. A small guard will be sufficient. They will probably have to strike the river road at Bonne Carre, but of that your knowledge of the topography of the country will give you the best direction. I need not assure you that I am taking every measure to open railroad and telegraphic communication. Capt. Kensel, who is present as this despatch is written, is only awaiting transportation to forward the Ammunitions. I think the gunboats had better press up to Franklin, and capture or destroy some boats that are building there. Of that you can tell better when you go forward. I wish to disengage McMillan's Regiment as early as it can be dispensed with, if at all, to hold Galveston. It is under advisement to build a Fort at Donaldsonville, at the junction of the Bayou and the river. We have thirty two-pounders here with which we can arm it. That will make a station easily held on the coast half way between here and Baton Rouge. I think a work about on the plan of Fort Macomb, with casemates only to flank the drawbridge, would be the better plan. Please advise me on the subject.
We have flaming reports of salt works at New Iberia. If practicable, will it not be better to reach them and destroy them? But that I leave entirely at your discretion. That portion of Louisiana lying West of the Mississippi River will be constituted a military district under your command, to be called the district of Lafourche. Headquarters wherever you may be. Col. Thomas writes me that the cars will pass to Lafourche to-day. Report to me early what rolling stock you find at Brashier or along the road. I think the iron howitzers at Raceland had better be sent here unless you have need of them. Your attention is directed to the practicability of so fortifying Brashier as to hold it with the aid of a gunboat, with a small force. Please report upon this subject. Is any fortification practicable at Thibodeaux or Terrebonne? Nothing else occurs to me of interest to communicate.

Sir: I have the honor to acknowledge the receipt of a communication from the War Department, dated November 4th, 1862, in relation to the arrest and imprisonment of J. J. Burrowes, a British subject, with enclosure.
J. J. Burrowes was Captain of the ""British Guards"" and presided at the meeting at which the Company voted to send
its arms and uniforms to Beauregard, and he was thereupon ordered to leave the city. He returned, however, and I found him in expression of rebel sentiments, and aiding in shipping plates from New Orleans in contravention of orders. For these reasons I ordered him into confinement. I have read his letter. Portions of the statement in which he says I called him a coward and a rebel are a mistake. What did happen was this. I asked him if he was a man that had borne arms against the United States. He replied that he was. I told him that I should send him to confinement. He then said he was a British subject. I told him it was cowardly to act as a rebel and then claim British protection.
Desirous to yield to any intimation of the Hon. Secretary of State, I have forwarded to Mr. Burrowes a parole, a copy of which is enclosed, upon signing which he will be released finally as he has already been temporarily, and for certain purposes connected with the health of his family, upon the intercession of a British Consul.

My dear Governor: I am much obliged to you for yours of the 23rd October, just received.
I shall now be able to find who the officer was, referred to in the Tribune article, and will then write to the General. It is possible (I hope the fact is so) that no such statement was made by either of his staff. That it was not made by Maj. Bell, I am satisfied. He called to see me, and I aided all that I was able in effecting what he said was important, an increase of the General's force. I think I have reason to complain that the General should give credit at all to representations of others, in regard to my feelings towards him. He saw enough of me, I had supposed, in New Orleans, if he had not known me before, to be satisfied that I would never directly or indirectly assail a person in his absence. If I had had cause of grievance with him he would have been apprised of it by myself. I am glad that I had not; on the contrary, as I said to him in a parting note, I felt obliged by the courtesy he showed me during my stay in the city.

Sir: After innumerable difficulties we arrived here two days too late -- last Saturday night. But as the Northern element of the Rebel army is most valuable to them, so it seems is the Northern wind, for we found the Bar so completely stripped as to show only about six feet water, while all of our vessels drew more. Genl. Weitzel frightened the Rebels terribly, and they will scareely make a stand this side of Franklin, and I do not think they will there unless reinforced, as they say they will be, from Vicksburg, which I greatly doubt. Day before yesterday the gun-boats went up the Teche to Pattersonville, and drove away the ""Cotton"" and shore batteries. The ""Kinsman"" fought splendidly, and came out with 54 shot holes in her -- one through her magazine. I lost three killed -- Navy none -- one died since. She will be in fighting order tomorrow. Lt. Wiggins deserves big promotion. No man in the Navy has fought more determinedly while suffering such damage to ship or boat. All did well, but as the ""Commodore's"" report will show, Wiggins was conspicuously brave among the gallant, Fard accompanying him. Col. of the 8th N. H. will be at the burned bridge over the boat today. I will have boats in readiness to cross Weitzel
as soon as he arrives. I have some Rebel sugar in R. R. Depot. Have not heard of any cotton burnt or unburnt. The Teche is obstructed but can be easily cleared I think. It is said there are from four to fourteen steamboats in it. Capt. Fuller commands the ""Cotton"" and fights her well, but she is so badly used up she will hardly fight again.
The Rebel planters would be glad to be loyal citizens if they were not deterred by the political vagabonds in the Rebel army. All begin to think slavery must go if Jan. 1st finds them in rebellion.
The gun-boats at 4 o'clock P. M. have just returned from the obstructions on the Teche, where the Rebels are building a dirt fort, and seem determined to make a stand for a fight. The ""Calhoun"" lost three seamen. No other casualties, I believe. Their works can be easily turned or passed entirely, and Franklin reached without passing near their forts. The iron-clad of the ""Kinsman"" is splendid, turning a 32-lb. shot fired at a less distance than 1000 yards. The Rebels have added to their stock of artillery. They have 20 pieces of Field Artillery of all classes. They will sink the ""Hart"" and ""Cotton"" after mounting their guns in the Fort. Health good. I have the honor to be,

Hon. Edwin M. Stanton, Secretary of War,
Washington, D. C.
Sir: I have the honor to acknowledge the receipt of the communication from the War Department of Nov. the 6th, enclosing a translation of the communication of the French Minister relating to some lumber not permitted to be shipped to Havana by the House of Gautherin and Co. Owing to the blockade of the river above, and the interdiction of traffic across the Lake by the Treasury regulations, lumber has become very dear and scarce in New Orleans. Large quantities being needed for roofing the Custom House, to render it habitable as the citadel of New Orleans, as well as to protect the United States from many thousands of dollars' loss, and also for replanking the wharfs and levees, which had been burnt by the rebels as a military necessity, I forbade the exportation of lumber to Havana without permission from these Headquarters. I was specially induced to this because the materials of a rebel gunboat, all sawed and fitted, which was uncompleted at the time of our coming here, had been secretly shipped, as I afterwards learned, for the purpose of being constructed elsewhere. This was done through the agency of a foreign house, the Agent of which had gone to Havana. I therefore ordered no more lumber to be shipped from New Orleans without permission from these Headquarters. The necessity of which Orders I trust will be seen.
M. Gautherin & Co.'s lumber came under that General Order. I forbear entering into the question of their title, although I believe the lumber which they had bought belonged to the Confederate Government, because when it becomes necessary to the U. S. to use it that question can be examined.
I am led, however, to remark upon one phrase of the Hon. Minister of France's communication, that Messrs. Gautherin & Co. were highly respectable French citizens of New Orleans. . . . Gautherin has run away, and the other two partners have [been] confined, awaiting trial for supplying the rebel army with half a million worth of cloth in a transaction closed on the 22nd day of June last, while they were enjoying the protection of the United States.
The particulars of that transaction will be found in my
despatch of the 13th of Nov. to the Hon. Secretary of State, relative to the $405,000 spirited away from the Bank of New Orleans. I have the honor to be very respectfully,

Please write to me to what extent, so far as you know, this is being done. Also what, if anything, is being done by Mr. Bouligny, or others, about electing members of Congress.

"November 28, 1862","Headquarters Department of the Gulf, New Orleans, Nov. 28th, 1862
To the President of the U. S. A.
Dear Sir: I am exceedingly obliged for your kind note inquiring for the success of our experiment in attempting the cultivation of sugar by free labor, and am happy to report it is succeeding admirably. I am informed by the Government Agent who has charge that upon one of the plantations, where sugar is being made by the negroes who had escaped there from into our lines, and have been sent back under wages with the same negroes and the same machinery by free labor, a hogshead & a half more of sugar has been made in a day than was ever before made in the same time on the plantation under slave labor.
Your friend, Col. Shaffer, has had put up to be forwarded to you a Bbl. of the first sugar ever made by free black labor in Louisiana, and the fact that it will have no flavor of the degrading whip will not, I know, render it less sweet to your taste. The planters seem to have been struck with a sort of judicial blindness, and some of them so deluded have abandoned their crops rather than work them with free labor. I
offered them as a basis a contract, the copy of which is enclosed for your information. It was rejected by many of them because they would not relinquish the right to use the whip, although I had provided a punishment for the refractory by means of the Provost Marshal, as you will see, preferably imprisonment in darkness on bread and water. I did not feel that I had a right, by the military power of the United States, to send back to be scourged, at the will of their former and in some cases infuriated masters, those black men who had fled to me for protection, while I had no doubt of my right to employ them, under the charge of whomsoever I might choose, to work for the benefit of themselves and the Government. I have, therefore, caused the negroes to be informed that they should have the same rights as to freedom, if so the law was, on the plantation as if they were in camp. And they have in a great majority of instances gone willingly to work, and work with a will. They were at first a little averse to going back lest they should lose some rights which would come to them in camp, but upon our assurances are quite content.
I think this scheme can be carried out without loss to the Government, and I hope with profit enough to enable us to support for six months longer the starving Whites & Blacks here, a somewhat herculean task.
We are feeding now daily in the City of New Orleans more than 32,000 Whites, 17,000 of which are British-born subjects, and mostly claiming British protection, and only about two thousand of whom are American citizens, the rest being of the several Nationalities who are represented here from all parts of the Globe.
Besides this, we have some ten thousand negroes to feed, besides those at work on the plantations, principally women & children. All this has thus far been done without any draft upon the treasury, although how much longer we can go on is a problem of which I am now anxiously seeking the solution.
I take the liberty to enclose to you a synopsis of our reports of the Relief Commission, published weekly, which may be interesting upon this topic (the synopsis only shows the free colored before the war). Of course, our operations are mostly yet unorganized, and without that completeness necessary to insure success, but I hope to get them in such form that they will work. The operations of Gen'l. Weitzel in the Lafourche Country, the richest sugar-planting part of Louisiana, have opened to us a very large number of slaves all of whom under
the act are free, and large crops of sugar, as well those already made as those in process of being made. I do myself the honor to enclose to you the Order that I have made to meet this state of things (Order No. 91), to protect the rights of the United States and of all concerned from the rapacity of swindlers & speculators, and the effects of disloyalty. All this portion of the country are rapidly returning to their Allegiance, and the elections are being organized for Wednesday next, and I doubt not a large vote will be thrown.
I found Dr. Cottman to be one of the candidates in the field, but he had voluntarily signed the Ordinance of Secession as one of the Convention which passed it, and had sat for his portrait in the Cartoon which was intended to render those signers immortal, which was published and exhibited here in the shop windows, in imitation of the picture of our Signers of the Declaration of Independence, and as the Doctor had never by any public act testified his abnegation of that act of signing, I thought it would be best that the Government should not be put to the scandal of having a person so situated elected, although the Doctor may be a good Union man now. So I very strongly advised him against the candidature. It looked too much like Aaron Burr's attempt to run for a seat in parliament, after he went to England to avoid his complication in the Mexican affairs and his combat with Hamilton. It is but fair to say that Doctor Cottman, after some urging, concluded to withdraw his name from the canvass. Two good unconditional Union men will be elected. I fear, however, we shall lose Mr. Bouligny. He was imprudent enough to run for the office of Justice of Peace under the Secessionists, and although I believe him always to have been a good Union man, and to have sought that office for personal reasons only, yet that fact tells against him. However, Mr. Flanders will be elected in his District and a more reliable or better Union man can not be found.
But to return to our negroes. I find this difficulty in prospect -- many of the planters here, while professing loyalty, and I doubt not feeling it if the ""Institution"" can be spared to them, have agreed together not to make any provision this autumn for another crop of sugar next season, hoping thereby to throw upon us this winter an immense number of blacks without employment and without any means of support for the future, the planters themselves living upon what they make from this crop. Thus no provision being made for the
crop, either of corn, potatoes, or cereal, the Government will be obliged to come to their terms for the future employment of the negroes or to be at enormous expenses to support them.
We shall have to meet this as best we may. Of course, we are not responsible for what may be done outside of our lines, but here I shall make what provisions I can for the future, as well the cereal and root crop as the cane. We shall endeavor to get a stock of cane laid down on all the plantations worked by Government, and to preserve seed-corn and potatoes to meet this contingency. I shall send out my third Regt. of Native Guards (colored), and set them to work preserving the cane and roots for a crop next year. It cannot be supposed that this great change in a social and political system can be made without shock, and I am only surprised that possibility opens up to me that it can be made at all. Certain it is I speak the almost universal sentiment and opinion of my Officers that Slavery is doomed. I have no doubt of it, and with every prejudice and early teaching against the result to which my mind had been irresistibly brought by my experience here, I am now convinced:
1st. That labor can be done in this State by Whites more economically than by Blacks and Slaves;
2nd. That Black labor can be as well governed, used, and made as profitable in a state of freedom as in slavery;
3rd. That while it would have been better could this emancipation of the slaves be gradual, yet it is quite feasible even under this great change as a governmental proposition to organize, control, and work the negro with profit and safety to the white, but that this can be best done when under military supervision. Of which, allow me to say, I do not desire the charge.
I must close by apologizing for this very long and discursive letter, but I am consoled by the thought that it is entirely at your option to read as much of it as it pleases you to do. I am,
Very truly, Your friend & Servt.,

Major Gen. Butler, Com'g Dept. of the Gulf
Sir: I have the honor to report that we arrived off here on the night of the first, but unfortunately too late to stop the rebels from crossing. We had a great deal of difficulty in getting over the Bay, and felt the want of our light-draught vessels very much. The day the ""Kinsman"" arrived I crossed in her and tried to get the ""Estrella"" over, but she grounded. I came up to the south of the ""Hart,"" which we chased but could not catch, and got the ""Estrella"" and ""St. Mary's"" over the next day, and the following day the ""Calhoun"" came up with the ""Diana.""
The night of our arrival here we chased the Rebel gunboat ""Cotton,"" but she got away from us by her superior speed. The same night we captured the Rebel steamer ""A. B. Seger."" She is a small boat about the size of the ""Fancy Natchez,"" and is very useful. Yesterday I went with all the gunboats up Bayou Teche, and found the enemy about fourteen miles from here posted above the obstructions they had sunk in the Teche.
We engaged them for two hours and drove them off as we also did the ""Cotton."" The ""Kinsman"" bore the brunt of it, and received fifty-four shells in her upper works and hull, and had one man killed, a soldier of the 21st Indiana, and five wounded. The pilot, John Bellino, had his leg badly shattered, and died to-day from the effect of amputation. Capt. Cook in the ""Estrella"" received three shots, and had two soldiers of the 21st Indiana killed whilst working the guns, and one badly wounded. The ""Diana"" received three shots, but had on person hurt. She will have to be hauled out, as her stern
is shot away. I received eight in the ""Calhoun,"" but fortunately received no material damage.
Capt. Wiggins fought his ship nobly. He was in such a position that he received the fire from all the artillery on shore, and at the same time had the ""Cotton"" playing upon him. He, however, drove the artillery away, and put several shots into the ""Cotton."" The whole Rebel force was there, numbering between three and four thousand men, with seventy field pieces.
We hear to-day we did them a great deal of damage, and that the ""Cotton"" is sunk. They had thrown up a mud fort this side, but evacuated on our arrival. We tried to remove the obstructions, but could not succeed. But I think that when General Weitzel arrives, so as to protect us from the sharpshooters on the banks, we can do so. I keep running up and down all the time so as to keep the river clear of the obstructions.
We can make all our repairs here, and I will have the ""Kinsman"" ready for service to-morrow. The ""Diana"" is getting timber out for Col. Thomas to repair the bridge at Bayou Boeuf. The enemy destroyed about a thousand hhds. of sugar, a lot of molasses, and also burnt 98 cars and three engines.
I send requisitions for ammunition for the three gunboats which we want very badly, as we fired away a good deal yesterday, and I expect to have a good deal more firing to do, and also for some blouses and shoes for the men who have been shipped. It is absolutely necessary that they should have some clothing, and I hope that you will order the Quarter Master to furnish it. We have got all the steamers above us, but I am afraid they will burn them.
The officers and men behaved splendidly. The ""Cotton"" is iron-cased, and did some splendid shooting. She mounts one long 32 pdr. 4-24 pdrs. and 2-6 pdrs. rifled guns. The iron-casing on the ""Kinsman"" and the ""Diana"" turned the shot beautifully. Capt. McLaughlin, who was on board the ""Calhoun"" with his company, went on shore with his men, and tried to get opposite the ""Cotton,"" but before he got up to her she had left. If she has not been sunk we will get her yet.
I shall send the coal schooner back as we do not want her, there being plenty of coal here.
Nov. 5, 1862
I HAVE just returned from another trip up the Teche with the ""Estrella."" I had three men killed by a shot. The
""Cotton"" was there. They had a battery on each bank, but we succeeded in driving them all off. I can do nothing until Gen. Weitzel arrives. They are now strongly posted at the obstructions, and although I can drive them off, I cannot work at them. We want some more ammunition now badly. I think the ""Cotton"" is casemated, as our shell glanced off. We had him on fire once. We could plainly see our shot strike him; but he fights bow on. I am,

Dear Harriet: Your letter enclosing one from Mr. Butler came by the ""Potomac"" three days ago. She goes out again tomorrow and takes the mail. You did not open Mr. Butler's letter as I told you to do. I hope you will the next one, as he has written for various things to be sent to him. He sent out the ""McClellan"" almost exclusively for me, by this time she is on her way back, with Mrs. Strong and Mrs. French as passengers. But I am not sorry that I did not wait. I would not like to be in New York to make the passage again. I was out this morning for half an hour's drive. The weather has changed suddenly from summer heat to not extreme cold, but so chilly that my fingers tingle through the gloves. I wish you were here and the children too for three months, but that cannot be; I should never dare to have them make the passage, nor could they bear the heat of spring. Poor Benny, when will he get his present? I will hunt for him one of these days. I really seem to have no time, and yet I have nothing to do. Is Paul helping you to take care of the other two, and setting them an example how to behave at table. I wish he would learn to write, and send me a letter sometimes. Would it be too much trouble for you to give them lessons in spelling sometimes after tea when the evenings are long? They learn more rapidly in this way than in any other. If you can do this, and give Paul a rubbing twice a week with the wash with less of the soda, -- I should like it very much. If there is anything you wish to cut up or change in the house that we did not speak of, do it as you think best in any way you like, either of mine or Blanche's. Mr. Butler would be glad to go home; I think he is tired and half homesick, yet he would struggle for his
place if any attempt was made unfairly to dispossess him. The rumour is again afloat that Fremont is to be sent to Texas, that is in Mr. Butler's Department. Gen. Weitzel has made a successful move about sixty miles out from New Orleans. It is opening further into the cotton and sugar countries. I hope Fisher has my letters to come out, and is already on the way. The articles Mr. Butler wrote for were embroidered cuffs and collar and a cap which he had ordered at Burbank & Chase, and he will perhaps need the new shirts that were left at home. But if Fisher has started and you have not opened the letter I shall write about it again. Several of the ladies and gentlemen belonging here have called, and all of our own officers. Headquarters is a place where you see much company and get great attention, but one gets very weary talking to strangers, who almost always have some interest they wish your influence to advance. Dr. Edson's charity would find ample scope in this town, but I think he would be shocked at the wickedness, not of one people, but of both north and south. Our people are prompt to imitate their vices. Give the family, Dr. Edson's, my regards. Dearest love to the children and yourself.

M. Shufeldt, Consul Gen. U. S. at Havana
Sir: I have received your note, and am obliged to you for its kindly suggestions, and the interest you take in the affairs of this Department. I can best inform you of my whole action in regard to the Quarantine laws, which have been relaxed because the frosts have settled all the questions of epidemic, by enclosing a report made to the Secretary of War upon the same subject, with the accompanying exhibits. You can make use of such portions of the report as you please among our Spanish friends at Havana.

"November 6, 1862","Headquarters, Department of the Gulf. New Orleans, Nov. 6th, 1862
Brig. Gen'l. Weitzel, Commanding District of the Teche
General: Your despatches of the 5th of November have been received, as also your telegram of this evening. I am directed by the Maj. Gen'l. Commdg. to reply.
These suggestions as to the field works at Donaldsonville will receive consideration. It will be necessary to make a Battery at Martin City, Berwick's Bay, or perhaps a field work; upon this subject he will confer with you.
In establishing the Military District of the Teche, he was aware that at the moment you did not occupy it except by your boats, and he gave the name in compliment to your skill and gallantry as it was undoubted you would soon be in occupation, and in putting the very large forces under the command of so young a General, he designed to show a mark of confidence in your discrimination and judgment. If it would be more desirable to yourself, he will change the name to the District of Lafourche.
That you should have declined the Command is the occasion of regret, arising most of all from the reasons given for so doing. As they are comprehended, they resolve themselves into two -- First, that under your command are put two Regiments of Native Guards (colored). And you say that in these organizations you have no confidence. As your reading must have made you aware, General Jackson entertained a different opinion upon that subject. It was arranged between the Commanding General and yourself that the colored regiments should be employed in guarding the Railroad. You do not complain in your report that they either failed in this duty in that respect, or that they have acted otherwise than correctly and obediently to the commands of their Officers, or that they have committed any outrage or pillage upon the inhabitants. The General was aware of your opinion that colored men will not fight. You have failed to show, by the conduct of these free men so far, anything to sustain that opinion -- and the General cannot see why you should decline the command, especially as you express a willingness to go forward to meet the only organized enemy with your own Brigade alone, without further support. The Commanding General cannot see how the fact that they are guarding your lines of communication by Rail Road can weaken your defense. He must therefore
look to the other reason, stated by you for an explanation of your declining the Command.
You say you cannot command these negro Regiments. Why not? The reason must be found in these sentences of your report:
You say that since the arrival of the negro regiments at that place you have seen symptoms of a servile insurrection. But as the only regiment, that has arrived there, got there as as soon as the rest of your command, of course the appearance of such symptoms is since their arrival. Have you not mistaken the cause? Is it the arrival of a negro regiment or is it the arrival of United States troops, carrying by the Act of Congress freedom to this servile race? Did you expect to march into that country, drained as you say it is by conscription of all its able-bodied white men, without leaving the negroes free to show symptoms of servile insurrection? Does not this state of things arise from the very fact of war itself? You are in a country where now the negroes outnumber the whites two to one, and these whites are in rebellion against the Government, or in terror seeking its protection.
Upon reflection, can you doubt that the same state of things would have arisen without the presence of a colored regiment? Did you not see symptoms of the same thing upon the plantations here upon our arrival, although under much less favorable circumstances for a revolt?
You say that the prospect of such an insurrection is heart-rending, and that you cannot be responsible for it. You are in no degree responsible for it. This responsibility rests upon those who have begun & carried out this war, and who have stopped at no barbarity, at no act of outrage upon the citizens & soldiers of the U. S. You have forwarded me records of a pretended court-martial, showing that seven men of one of your regiments, who enlisted here in the Eighth Vermont, who had surrendered themselves prisoners of war, were in cold blood murdered, and, as certain information shows, were required to dig their own graves. You are asked if this is not an occurrence equally as heartrending as a prospective servile insurrection.
The question is now to be met, whether, in a hostile, rebellious part of the State, where this very murder has been committed by the militia, you are to stop in the operations of the field to put down servile insurrection, because the men & women
are terror-stricken. Whenever was it heard before that a victorious Gen'l. in an unsurrendered province stopped in his course for the purpose of preventing the rebellious inhabitants of that province from destroying each other, or refused to take command of a conquered province lest he should be made responsible for their self-destruction? As a military question, perhaps, the more terror-stricken the inhabitants are that are left in your rear, the more safe will be your lines of communication.
You say there have appeared before your eyes the very facts, in terror-stricken women & children and men, which you had before contemplated in theory. Grant it; but is not the remedy to be found in the surrender of the neighbors and fathers, brothers & sons of the terror-stricken women and children, who are now in arms against the Government, within twenty miles of you? And when that is done, and you have no longer to fear from these organized forces, and they have returned peaceably to their homes, you will be able to use the full power of your troops to ensure your safety from the so-much-feared by them but not by us -- servile insurrection.
If you desire, you can send a flag of truce to the Commander of these forces, embracing these views and placing upon him the responsibility which belongs to him. Even that course will not remove it from you, for upon you it has never rested. Say to them that if all armed opposition to the authority of the United States shall cease in Louisiana, on the West Bank of the river, you are authorized by the Commanding General to say that the same protection against negro or other violence will be afforded that part of Louisiana that has been in the part already in the possession of the troops of the United States. If that is refused, whatever may ensue is upon them and not upon you or upon the United States. You will have done all that is required of a brave, humane man to avert from these deluded people the horrible consequences of their insane war upon the Government.
With or without such a message, the Commdg. Gen'l. can see in your reasons nothing which should justly cause you to decline a high and honorable command. Nor does he see how the remedy which you propose will aid the matter. And that remedy is that either he or some one of his officers shall take command of the negro regiments, and relieve you of them. Do you think that change will be less likely to incite a servile insurrection under his command or that of any of his officers
than under your own? Will the horror be less if they are under the command of an officer not present on the scene to check and allay these horrors, any less than if commanded by an officer present and ready to adopt proper measures? If your negro or other regiments commit any outrage upon unoffending and unarmed people, quietly attending to their own business, let them be most severely punished. But, while operations in the field are going on, I do not see how you can turn aside from the armed enemy before you to protect or defend the wives and children of these armed enemies from the consequences of their own rebellious wickedness.
Consider this case. General Bragg is at liberty to ravage the homes of our brethren of Kentucky because the Union Army of Louisiana are protecting his wife and his home against his negroes. Without that protection, he would have to come back to take care of his wife, his home, and his negroes. It is understood that Mrs. Bragg is one of those terrified women of whom you speak in your report.
This subject is not for the first time under the consideration of the Commdg. General. When in command of the Dept. of Annapolis, in May, 1861, he was asked to protect a community against the consequences of a servile insurrection. He replied that when that community laid down its arms and called upon him for protection, he would give it, because from that moment between them and him war would cease. The same principles initiated there will govern his and your action now; and you will afford such protection as soon as the community, through its organized rules, shall ask it. Your reports and this reply, I am instructed to say, will be forwarded by to-morrow's mail to the Commanding General of the Army.
In the meantime, these colored regiments of free men, raised by the authority of the President and approved by him as the Commander-in-Chief of the Army, must be commanded by the Officers of the Army of the United States, like any other Regiment.
The Commdg. General does not doubt that everything that prudence, sagacity, skill, and courage can do will be done by you, General, to prosecute the campaign you have so successfully begun.

My dear Butler: You wish to know what consignments have been made to me and what drafts have been made on me. There have been some 4900 hgds. sugar and some 80 bbls. molasses, and a few loads scrap iron, of which I have received bills of lading. All had arrived in New York except the sugar on the ""Charles Kean,"" and the little lot of metal on the ""John Griffin."" Those may have arrived since I left New York last Friday.
I have not sold so much sugar as I have paid in freights and insurances. I met your drafts of $50,000 and $9,409.00, and the Colonel's for $10995.00, by raising the money at the Railroad Bank, Lowell, for note of $71,151.08.
The Col. has notified me of a draft in favor of H. M. Jose of $25,000.00. Also in favor of C. S. Whittier or Read for $20,000, which I suppose will not be presented, as he does not recognize the sale to the Col., and Mr. Whittier and as you have countermanded the trade.
I stored the sugars for better prices, as they would not pay invoices on their arrival, and I, as well as the Col., thought they would rise.
I got notice of your drafts in New York last Thursday with acceptance waived, which gave me Friday and Saturday to raise the amount of rising seventy thousand dollars. I could not raise it in New York, as no one would take the sugar as collateral, as I was not the owner nor had written authority to hypothecate them. Nor, if I had, I would not have done it for less than one per ct. brokerage or Commission -- besides the interest; so I returned to Boston, found Carney dry, then came to Lowell and got the money on Carney's recommendation in my name, Webster's, Read's and George's, at regular interest.
I think I shall accept your favor and come to New Orleans in a few days.
If you have occasion to draw further before I see you, do not waive acceptance, and draw on as long time as convenient. Your drafts frightened me when I found I could not raise a dollar on the sugar in New York, and that Carney's loan was up so that I could not get it of him. But we got it through after much tribulation.
McClellan is again superseded, and it looks as if the Government
were determined on pressing the war to an emancipation end if not for emancipation purposes.
Have a great deal to say if I shall have the good fortune to see you.

Hon. Henry Wilson, Washington, D. C.
My dear Sir: Somewhat irregularly, perhaps, but impelled by what seems to me a grave necessity, I venture to address you upon the state of affairs in this department. We want more men. We have now about 10,000 effective white soldiers, of which two regiments were raised here. We have two regiments of native guards (colored), in good condition and doing good service in the field; another of the same sort has nearly completed its organization; and we are now raising a regiment of Texas cavalry. From the North we get no recruits to fill up the ranks of our old regiments, but for this have to depend entirely upon enlistments here. With this little force we have to hold this city against Rebels within as well as without; to keep our lines north of the city always in readiness to receive anything which may drop from above -- and something may come after any battle between the Rebels and the Army of the West, and we have succeeded during the past three weeks in acquiring a foothold in Western Louisiana, which opens the richest part of the State to our control, and seriously threatens the Rebel communications with their Beef Barrel Texas, and we are now easting about for a regiment to send to Galveston -- which the Navy has opened to us.
Rear Admiral Farragut is rather catching it for not having taken Mobile before this. That he has not done so is no fault of his. With ten thousand -- even with 7,000 troops we can take it and hold it. Without the coöperation of the Army, it is manifestly quite useless for the Navy to attempt to operate against the place.
We want to extend our lines of men so as to complete the cutting off of Rebel communication with the West. Up to date, we have been victorious wherever we have met the enemy. We only want more men to keep it up. Re-enforcements have been promised us, but they have not come. Troops want to come here -- New England troops especially, I know. Officers write me to get their command ordered here, and I
hear the same thing from my officers who have come back from the North.
At this moment -- while writing this -- I learn that Sterling Price is crossing the Mississippi at Port Hudson, and is working for the salt mines, against which Gen. Weitzel is operating. He hopes to hold the mines, which are of incalculable importance to the Rebels, and he hopes to keep open communication with the ""Beef barrel"" above mentioned. He has 10,000 men. I can spare not over 7,000 to oppose him. Well, there's 10,000 less for Grant to fight, and if I had 5,000 more men the enemy before Grant would be 20,000 less.
Believe me, when the rains descend and the mud comes, the army of the Potomac can't move, the Rebels will move down this way to get at the supplies. With 5,000 more men I will cut them off from Texas. With yet 7,000 men, I will take and hold Mobile.
I beg you, as chairman of the Military Committee, to use your influence to have more troops sent here -- Mass. troops especially. The Rebels are near starvation. Send us troops enough and we will bring them quite to that point.
I write to you because I have written to all manner of official personages and get nothing except promises in return, and because I know that if you are convinced of the necessity of my call for more troops you will leave no means untried to have it answered. Although we differ in politics we are both bent upon doing the best for the country, and I have no hesitation therefore in asking your aid.

Hon. Wm. H. Seward, Sec'y of State
Sir: I beg leave to enclose to you a digest of the Laws of France upon the subject of slavery, which an eminent French lawyer has prepared for me.
As every owner of slaves loses his nationality by owning them (entrainera la perte de la qualité de citoyen français), it becomes a most vital question here, where every man of any property is an owner of slaves and every other man claims to be a French citizen, what is the slave-owner's status.
The French Consul claims that losing a quality of a French citizen only means that he loses his right to vote in France. I claim, on the contrary, that the loss is of nationality.
In support of this proposition, I find that a subject of France who takes an oath of allegiance to a foreign power and becomes a citizen thereof suffers (la perte de la qualité de citoyen français), the civil code using the same word in both cases. Is it to be said that the code, in the case of the abjuration by the French citizen of his Government, means only that he loses his right to vote in France, or does he lose his French nationality?
I am in much need of the instruction of the State Department
upon the topic, and await with impatience an authoritative exposition of it. I have the honor to be,

My Dear General: I have been waiting, in order to reply satisfactorily to your letter stating fully your action in relation
to trade with persons in rebel lines, for some decision by the Government in the premises, and the Government has been waiting for the return of Lord Lyons in order that its decision may not conflict with assurances given by the Secretary of State to the representatives of foreign states. Lord Lyons has now returned, and the Secretary of State had an interview with him yesterday, which I understand was satisfactory. The subject of cotton, rice, tobacco, and sugar will come up in the Cabinet perhaps, today -- at any rate, shortly -- and we shall get on to some definite plan, I hope. Meantime, I write that you may not think I have neglected a matter in which you necessarily feel so deep an interest.
Gen. Banks goes to New Orleans, not, as I understood, to supersede you; but to conduct an expedition to Texas while you are engaged nearer to your present Headquarters. Most earnestly do I hope for his success.
Your own success has been very great. Except the complaints to which I called your attention in my last, I have heard of none except from men whose loyalty is either doubtful, or at any rate not very self-sacrificing. I hope you will not misconstrue that letter. It was prompted solely by a true regard and friendship mixed with sincere conviction of public duty. I do not believe that you yourself desire more earnestly your distinguished success in the most important sphere you have occupied and must yet occupy, and in the even larger scope which will I trust soon be given to your powers, and I am sure that few men could have fulfilled your difficult task so well as you have -- no man better.
The removal of McClellan will not take you by surprise. His course made it indispensable. The President postponed it long -- too long -- as long as he could; but at length felt driven to it by McClellan's persistency in disregard of his wishes and directions, and by his manifest purpose to keep his army practically inactive, as it was kept last winter.
For General of the Army in his place I preferred Hooker. The President and Gen. Halleck preferred Burnside. I hope their preference will be justified by the event. Burnside has some excellent qualities, and I hope too he may prove to possess all that he needs for his trying post. He shall have my most cordial support, and will, I am sure, have that of the whole administration.
I shall write you as soon as possible again. Meantime, let

General: I have given a permit to the sloop boat ""Vengeur."" Wm. H. Bailey, master, to proceed to New Orleans, with eight passengers, refugees from Confederate persecution in this town. The master of the boat has also permission to bring back such provisions as he can carry. The poor people who have remained behind are in a sad state of destitution, and in a short time will be on the verge of absolute starvation. The Confederate force, who hold the bridge connecting Galveston Island with the main land, will not allow an ounce of provisions to cross, besides which their cavalry squads have driven off and killed all the cattle they could get at, shooting in their tracks those that they were unable to drive. Some little beef is still left on the Island, which, together with some hogs, chickens, and such fish as the people are able to catch, is all that they have to eat. Groceries there are none, very little corn-meal is left, and that is selling at $5.00 a bushel. What flour there is, is held at $50.00 the sack of 100 lbs. in gold, the holder refusing to take Confederate money for it. In fact, I am told this morning that neither flour nor corn-meal is to be bought at any price, and I have been applied to by one or two persons, who state that their families have not a mouthful to eat.
If you can, General, with your well-known benevolence, forward the sending of some provisions to this port, it will be the means of rescuing many innocent people from great suffering. Our own supplies are too short to enable us to afford them any relief. I am now holding this harbor with this vessel, the gun-boat ""Owasco,"" and one of the mortar schooners, Commander Renshaw having gone into Matagonda Bay with the ""Westfield"" and ""Clifton"" a fortnight ago. I am looking for his return daily. Though the town is under our guns, we have no force to occupy it, and feel the want of some troops sadly. The place can easily be held by a regiment with the aid of one or two vessels in the harbor, and the people remaining here are looking anxiously for the arrival of our troops. Most of them are citizens of foreign birth, who have no sympathy with the Confederate cause, and I am assured that large numbers would gladly enlist in our service, and had I arms to give them they would undertake to organize themselves, and hold the town under cover of the night. Patrols of the enemy come in from the other side, pick up conscripts wherever they can catch them, and harass the people in every possible way, which we are powerless to prevent, and which renders our occupation hitherto anything but a fortunate event to the well-disposed inhabitants. We have now some thirty refugees living on the end of a dock near our vessels, as their only asylum from seizure by the Rebels. This town is well-built, containing many fine stores and dwelling-houses, together with other structures which could be converted into quite formidable strong-holds, and easily held against anything less than artillery, from which the guns of our vessels would prove an ample protection. There are two fine foundries here, one of which I understand to be in complete running order; the machinery of the other I have taken down, but it can readily be replaced. In conclusion, permit me to say that if you can spare a detachment from the force under your command to hold this city, I am sure the good of the public service will be vastly benefited. I am, with great respect,

Major General Halleck, Commanding Armies of the United States
General: I beg leave to enclose to you my communication to Lt. Gen. Pemberton of the Confederate forces upon the subject of the murder of seven of my soldiers when two companies of my Eighth Vermont Regiment surrendered at Bayou des Allemands. There were enlisted in those companies and surrendered as prisoners of war, with them, seven Germans, residents of Louisiana, who owed no farther allegiance to the state of Louisiana than we all owe to our states by being inhabitants thereof.
Because of their enlistment with us, they were tried for desertion in the militia in which they never acted, and for treason to the state of Louisiana to which they never owed allegiance -- because they were naturalized citizens of the United States, were found guilty of their supposed offences only, and were executed in obedience to the orders of a Militia Court Martial, acting by order of Major Gen. Lewis of the Militia of the State.
I have treated of the subjects in my letter to Gen. Pemberton, to which I beg leave to refer you. I send also a partial copy of the proceedings of that Court Martial, which I have captured, and from which you will learn the facts.
I beg specific instructions upon this matter. I hope and trust those instructions will be to shoot twice as many more of the Confederate prisoners of war in retaliation. I have the honor to be.
Your obdt. servant,
Benj. F. Butler, Major Gen. Commanding
Lieut. Gen. Pemberton, Com'g at Vicksburg
General: I have received your communication by the flag of truce, with prisoners which have been duly receipted for. I am excessively grieved at the mistake in regard to Pemington. I had supposed that he was confined at Fort Jackson, and sent an order there for his release; but, not being confined there, by some unaccountable blunder the matter was not reported to me, he remaining without being paroled till Oct. 18th., I supposing up to that time Pemington had been released. I have ordered his unconditional release in consideration of the unintentional injustice which has been done him, and will send him up with the other prisoners if you desire.
It did not need the retaliation of the detention of two privates, I assure you, to cause this act of justice to be done. I beg to call your attention to the fact that two lieutenants of the Indiana Regiment, for whose exchange I sent Capt. Murphy of the Confederate Navy, have not been released, and Capt. Murphy has not returned and reported to the Head Quarters. May I ask that you will see that they are released.
I have some two hundred prisoners whom I will send to you as soon as transportation can be spared. With this exception, I will retain fourteen of the most considerable of them, including Brig. Gen. Clark, until I receive instructions from my Government as to the course to be taken in relation to the proceedings of a pretended Court Martial, held on the pretended authority of Maj. Gen. Lewis, by which seven United States soldiers had been executed for no crime. The charge alleges ""desertion and treason,"" but that desertion is only supported by the fact that as residents of Louisiana they formed a part of the supposed militia of Louisiana. There is no pretence that they had ever been in the field. They had duly enlisted in the service of the United States, were surrendered prisoners of war, were made to dig their own graves, and then wantonly murdered. You will be pleased to inform me whether this act is assumed by the Confederate Government.
I have enlisted a number of thousand of the inhabitants of the State of Louisiana into the army of the United States, and I am naturally desirous to know whether this course is to be taken towards them when they surrender prisoners of war. I need not say to you that I know how to protect myself and my soldiers from such acts.
 -- 474  -- To you, formerly a soldier of the United States Army, knowing the laws and rules of war, I need not further enlarge upon the probable consequence of allowing the proceedings of such a court to go on unrevised. The copy of the proceedings in my hands is not complete, but is sufficiently so to show the nature of the transaction. I have desired, and still desire, in all cases to conduct the war according to its uses among civilized nations; but this transaction cannot be tolerated. I have the honor to be.

Hon. Edwin M. Stanton, Sec'y of War
Sir: I have addressed you directly in this despatch because the subject relates to other matters than the movement of troops in the field.
As you may have learned from the despatches to Gen. Halleck, I have moved Brig. Gen. Weitzel into the Lafourche country, and have taken possession of the richest portion of Louisiana. Thousands of hhds. of sugar, at the value of at least a million of dollars, ought at once to pass into the hands of the United States, together with much other property. I have therefore organized a Commission to take charge of the whole business, so as, if possible, to save this property to the United States, and have put the oldest and most honest men I have at the head of it.
I annex the copy of the Order No. 91, and the memorandum of contract, which will explain themselves. The experiment of free labor which I am trying is succeeding admirably, and I hope large results, not so much in profit to the United States as in example.
Will you allow me to avail myself of this note to ask of you re-enforcements? I have had none save my free native guards (colored), and while they are doing good service, still I find trouble, because they are not formally recognized by the Department. I have the honor to be,

Subject Matter of ""Memorandum"" referred to
Owing to the necessity of employing the negroes who have left plantations, and of securing the present crop of cane and other cereals, repairing the levee, &c., the United States will employ them under the direction of loyal plantors and overseers, to be paid, by them $10 per month for males (the price for females and minors was not mentioned in the memorandum), $3 of which may be expended for necessary clothing, the United States to protect them, the planters, and their plantations. The planters to furnish proper food and medicine, and to take care of those incapacitated by sickness or age. No cruel or corporal punishment to be inflicted, but any refusal to do labor to be reported to the Provost Marshal of the district and to be punished under his orders. If any planter refuses to enter into this arrangement, his slaves may hire themselves to any other loyal planter, or any person whom the United States may elect. This arrangement is not to affect the legal rights of either master or slave.
The question of freedom to be determined by considerations wholly outside the provisions of this contract."

Very respectfully, Your obdt. Servant,

Washington, November 6th, 1862 Sir: I do myself the honor to transmit to you the accompanying extracts from a letter and statement, which have been received by Earl Russell from Professor Donaldson and Mr. Lingham, the Rector of Lambeth, complaining of the arbitrary conduct of General Butler towards their relative, Mr. John George Lingham, a British merchant at New Orleans.
You will perceive that Mr. Lingham appears to have been sentenced by General Butler to no less than three years' imprisonment in Fort Pickens, for an offence which bears no proportion to so heavy a sentence, and I have, under the circumstances, been instructed to apply to you for his immediate release, unless some plot or conspiracy has been proved against him.
Earl Russell has observed that the statements submitted to him contained no mention of Mr. Lingham having been put upon his trial, but that it is scarcely possible to suppose that the punishment which has been inflicted upon him should not have been preceded by a trial of some sort.
I avail myself of this opportunity to renew to you the assurance of my highest consideration.

"October 15, 1862","Bolton Gardens, Russell Square, Oct. 15th, 1862
I have this day received from Mr. W. H. Haynes, merchant at Liverpool, a letter stating that my brother-in-law. Mr. John George Lingham, an English merchant at New Orleans, has been seized by order of the Federal General Butler, and sentenced to three years imprisonment in Fort Pickens, and, being in indifferent health, this is very serious. As far as Mr. Haynes can understand, three gentlemen, among whom he was one, fearing an outbreak during this reign of terror, had proposed to send away their plate and valuables by the British ship ""Essex,"" now lying in New Orleans, and it is supposed that General Butler was resolved to confiscate the property under some pretence of disloyalty. The names of the other two were Mr. Allen and Mr. Mount; the sentence of the latter is one year, with ball and chain round his legs.
Mr. Lingham has on various occasions acted as Acting Consul at New Orleans, in Mr. Mure's absence, although not so at this period.
I beg to assure your Lordship that Mr. Lingham has ever expressed a firm determination never to seek naturalization in America, as he never forsook the character of an English-man; and he has throughout the present contest between the North and the South maintained a perfect neutrality, never in any of his letters to his family alluding to political matters. He married a Creole lady of New Orleans, by whom he has a son about 15 years old.
On the part of his family and of his brother, the Revd. J. Lingham, Rector of Lambeth, whose signature is hereunto appended with my own, I beg to entreat your Lordship to take such steps with the Federal Government of America that immediate inquiry be made into the circumstances, in order that Mr. G. Lingham may, as a British subject, be restored to liberty, and his life and property secured from further aggression. I beg permission to assure your Lordship of the deep affliction into which the family are plunged by these cruel circumstances; and we throw ourselves on your Lordship's sympathy to obtain redress for this outrage upon our brother."

Genl.: I take pleasure in stating to you in this note what I have explained to you personally, that the purport of the objectionable article, which is the basis of your Order for the suppression of the Advocate, has been understood entirely different from the intention of the writer. The design of the article was to express the ardent desire of the Editor for peace. My habits of life, my religious professions, have always been for peace, and nothing of course can be more ardently sought by every well-wisher to the Country. Armed intervention was inadvertently mentioned as one of the means through which peace might be obtained, and the article would certainly bear the interpretation that I desired such intervention as the means of obtaining peace. This I regret. I have never been in favor of armed intervention by a foreign power in this war; my whole thought has been opposed to it. I can point to many articles in my paper expressing that thought. I am entirely opposed to any interference by foreigners with the affairs of this Country, and if permitted the paper will most fully show that opposition.

Sir: Your note upon the subject of the article in the Advocate is satisfactory, and its publication is permitted. I can have no objection to any proper advocacy of peace. To obtain it, the United States are making war. But peace can never be obtained by armed intervention of a foreign power. That would be an act of war, and its possible effect would only be to put away the day of peace.
No more delusively treasonable idea can be entertained than the advocacy of foreign intervention, which can never be permitted either directly or covertly in this department. Whoever desires foreign aid to Rebellion, and expresses that desire, is a traitor and an enemy to the Government, and will be so treated.

Governor: I have the pleasure of inclosing you a copy of the proceedings of a Court of Inquiry in the case of the Seventh Vermont Reg. Volunteers. When the request for such a board was made, I informed Major Holbrook, then commanding, that I would order the Court, and he might choose any officers of my command who were not engaged in the battle to compose the board. For reasons which he judged sufficient, he declined the offer, and requested that I would forward the papers to Washington, which I did.

I added a recorder, a gentleman of considerable legal experience, who was not even present in the Department at the time of the matter.

The Commanding General has examined with care the findings, proceedings, and testimony of the Court of Inquiry, whereof Col. Henry Deming is president, in the matter of the 7th regt. Vermont Volunteers, and approves the proceeding and finding. It is apparent that every conclusion arrived at by the Court is supported by the testimony of the witnesses called on behalf of the Regiment. The General is constrained to find that the charge against the Regiment of breaking in disorder before the enemy is fully proved. Two fifths of the Regiment never returned to the line of battle after they broke and fled.
That the Regiment did fire upon the Indiana Regiment, and that that was the only firing done by the Regiment that day, although they held the centre of the line which was mostly hotly pressed.
The General is glad to find that most of the line officers behaved well, and that the official reports which led him to believe that the Regimental colors were lost by the Regiment were mistakes, and therefore he has pleasure in ordering the colors of the Regiment to be restored to the Regiment, with privilege to carry them. But he cannot order them to be inscribed with the name of the glorious battle of Baton Rouge.
The General doubts not that, now having an officer as commander who will not force them out of sight for shelter in a ravine during an action as did their late Lt. Col., the Regiment will in its next action retrieve its position and earn a proud name for itself and State."

The Commanding General, upon the finding of the Board of Inquiry upon the conduct of the 7th Regiment Vermont Volunteers at the battle of Baton Rouge, learns that he was led into a mistake by the official reports of that action as to the loss by that regiment of its colors; it proving to have been the camp color left in camp, and not the regimental color, that was brought off the field by the Massachusetts Battery.
He therefore has pleasure in ordering the regimental colors to be restored to the regiment, not doubting that it will, in its next action, earn for itself a position and name which will be a credit to itself, its State, and country.

Do by all means send an order by return Steamer either to send to you, or sell at public auction, the steamboat ""Neafic,"" now lying at the wharf at Pensacola. The sale made by General Dow is certainly unauthorized and illegal. He is in a perfect stew about that, and the proceedings of a board which apprised a lot of horses, a copy of which I herewith send you so that you may be posted on what is going on here. Candidly speaking, the whole is a complete swindle of Government property, this is a little the d -- st command I ever saw. Everybody here is complaining of General Dow. My God, is there no way to stay this? Letters from good and loyal citizens representing gross injustice done them by General Dow, I am told, have
been sent to General Butler, no reply received to any one of them. They say they fear that these letters never reached the Commanding General of the Department.
But about our own Department, do all, everything you can to have the proceedings of the Board on the horses and mules made null and void. Look carefully at my letter marked ""A,"" and at the proceedings of the ""B,"" and my endorsement thereon. Have also an order published forbidding the sale of any more horses to Officers, on the grounds that they are absolutely necessary for service in the Quarter Master's Department, also for Cavalry and Light Artillery Service.
I commenced today to turn over the Quarter Master Stores. A quarter master is much needed here, some one who will take an interest in the Government, setting General Dow to one side. If you can possibly send one, please do so. It is all important for the public interest. Also have orders sent here that no timber or lumber will be shipped from this place without orders from Hd Qr Dept. I shall go over on the next trip of the boat and see you.
My kindest regards to Turner, Peters, and all my friends. I will keep you posted as to the doings here. I have, when I get there, something to tell you about money turned in to me by General Dow.

My dear Sir: In the harbor of Annapolis, in April of last year, before I had landed at that place, I had the pleasure of meeting Mr. Schuyler Hamilton, then private in the New York Seventh -- now by right of brilliant service Major General. He immediately joined my Staff, and remained with me until his services were claimed by Gen. Scott. Upon his judgment and skill I was accustomed to rely with entire confidence. His success since that time has increased that confidence, if that were possible. I believe that here he would be very useful to the public service.
I have written to Gen. Halleck setting forth these facts, and asking that, if consistent with his views of the public necessities, he may be assigned to a command in this Department. I take the liberty to write this to you, in order to solicit your influence to procure a favorable answer to my petition.

"December 4, 1862","New York, Dec. 4, 1862 General Butler
Dear General: Your very kind and complimentary letter as to my son, Schuyler, I, immediately on its receipt, communicated to Gen. Halleck. What course he may pursue I am unable to judge. It is a fact that the Secretary of War requested Schuyler to remain at Washington to confer with him from time to time as to army arrangements. This may possibly have been prompted by his knowledge, in the staff of General Scott, of the administrative part of the service on a large scale.
Schuyler declined the honor, preferring to serve at the west, where he was known and where the field of honor would be a wide one. He is now near Nashville. I take for granted no person can better appreciate the very important services you have been rendering to the nation, in your present scene.
I may say to you, without compliment and with entire truth, that in the minds of intelligent men you have established yourself in an estimation few public servants have had the good fortune to reach at any time in any country. Great and hazardous as have been the difficulties of your position, you have, with a wonderful perspicacity, directness, and energy, surmounted them all. The attacks upon you I have noticed. Not one seems to me to have the least force. I presume from your letter you have an incursion in view. Whether the War Department can supply the force you need is a question at this moment. The expedition of Gen. Banks numbers 38,000 men, and unless new bodies come in I presume it absorbs all the troops now at command. I, of course, speak without any authority or precise knowledge on this subject. But so strong is my impression that, were I situated as you are, I think my efforts would be to embody the slaves in corps under white officers, give them the preparatory drilling, and to hold them ready for events. 'Tis certain that a great change has taken place in thinking minds on this subject. I am aware of your former views -- mine were similar. The magnitude of the rebellion demands a change of policy, and this is the change most obvious.
A recent publication by Mass. Historical Society contains all that I am aware has been written in relation to the negro as a soldier and a citizen. It is pregnant with valuable facts. I will write to Boston and urge a copy may be sent you.
You will pardon this long note, and accept my thanks for your kind remembrance of my son, and much more for your invaluable services.
Yours very respectfully, John C. Hamilton
P. S. Since I wrote, I find published in the Herald a note of Mr. Seward's, proving the true temper of the cabinet. Nothing has transpired to indicate any change, and I am well informed that General Banks declared while here that the President would carry into effect his proclamation. I expect to go to General Halleck in a few days, and will have an interview with the President myself, as he has thought proper to communicate to me previously matters of high importance. In my opinion, the early employment of negroes as soldiers, under white officers, is the measure the loyal portion of this country will, with few exceptions, most warmly approve. The statements as to the conduct of those already employed
justify confidence. I think it certain that it must come to this at last, and the man who earliest meets the great necessity will be the object of most approval. You will see a great clamor is being raised as to General Halleck's report. I am happy to be able to state that the impression it has made is extending; and that General McClellan's friends are pursuing their object with a heated indiscretion that must ere long powerfully react. General Scott deems the report of General H. unanswerable. Please consider what I write confidential, and if I can serve by any politeness, please apprise me.

Dear Harriet: A steamer goes out tomorrow, and you must have a letter. You would not think it possible I could be hurried, yet it is a truth that every moment is taken up with something. This morning I went out to look at the house again that we are to move into, and gave some orders about the cleaning of it, etc. I rode a little way after that, and returned in haste to dress to receive some relations of Mr. Soule, who went North with me last summer as a prisoner. His friends say he is suffering from ill-health, and are very desirous Mr. Butler should write, asking his release on parole. One was an old lady, a French woman and sister-in-law of Soulé's; the other rather a fine looking woman who acted as interpreter. The interview was not long, and by no means unpleasant. Both were ladies, and this town swarms with such a set of worthless women coming about on any pretence they can pick up, that to meet with a refined and elegant woman is a pleasure. The old lady was satisfied that I would further her petition if I could, and went away quite cheerful. The house would be crowded with petitioners, urging me to use my influence, if the guard allowed them to enter. Mr. Butler refuses to have them come to the house; and insists that the office shall be the only place, yet a great many present themselves and are received at the house. The Sisters of Charity come to see me almost every day. Yesterday we steamed down the river fifteen miles, to see sugar making on a large Plantation, twenty gentlemen perhaps, the French Admiral, and our Admiral Farragut. Mr. Butler invited them. We dined at the plantation, -- fortunately, a
very excellent dinner. No lady but myself, yet it was not in the least embarrassing. I declined to go at first, but Mr. Butler insisted, and I found it quite delightful. I wish you could see the splendid roses the younger gentlemen gathered for me. The dinner was partly provided by our servants. The plantation is owned by an old bachelor, who would have found it difficult to provide for such a party if we had not carried the material with us. Plantation life would never please me. A strip of land bordering the river, running back a mile to an impassable swamp. Houses three-quarters of a mile apart, more or less. The land a dead level, lower than the river. The negroes a miserable, ragged, degraded-looking people, far behind the city negro. On Saturday evening a great Union meeting, the theater was crammed, thousands outside. Mr. Durant, a citizen, and Col. Deming were the speakers. Both were excellent. Mr. Durant's was a finished, classical speech. Col. Deming's contrasted well, full of fun, and warmly applauded. I look for Fisher by the next boat. You need not be afraid your letters will be uninteresting. The smallest thing you do, or the children say, is of much more interest than what chances in N.

Sir: I have been asked by the members of the family of Mr. Pierre Soulé, now in confinement at Fort Lafayette, to suggest the propriety of having him released on his parole, because of his age. It is represented that his health is suffering from the confinement. I am convinced that Mr. Soulé might with safety be given his parole to reside in the city of Boston, and not to communicate with the enemies of the United States, until such time that he might be brought to trial. I believe he would keep that parole, and hope you will grant him that indulgence, if not inconsistent with your views of public duties. I have the honor to be,

Maj. Gen'l. H. W. Halleck, Commander-in-Chief U. S. Army
General: I have the honor to recount a very successful expedition under General Weitzel, of the preparations for the march of which I have previously informed the Commanding General.
General Weitzel landed at Donaldsonville, and took up his line of march on Sunday the 26th inst. About nine miles beyond Donaldsonville he met the enemy in force. A sharp engagement ensued, in which he lost 18 killed and 68 wounded. Full list of casualties has been recorded and published. The Comm'd'g Officer of the enemy, Col. McPheeters, was killed, and the enemy lost quite a large number in killed and wounded. Two hundred and sixty-eight prisoners were captured; and also one piece of Artillery. Since then he has met with no opposition, and the whole of the country is now open to him.
The enemy has evacuated Brashier City, having by means of the Railroad got away before our gunboats could cut off their retreat, the Naval force having been delayed by a very severe storm. I send you General Weitzel's report received to-day.
Sending off so large a proportion of our effective force has necessarily left me very weak here, and I beg leave to urge upon the Commanding General the necessity of reinforcements, with which I can operate on Mobile or Texas or up the river. I am organizing some companies of Texas Volunteers of Cavalry, which I hope will grow into a Regiment.
I will forward by the next mail my letter of instructions to General Weitzel, in answer to his despatch herewith sent. I am just informed that our Railroad communications with General Weitzel are open, and his messenger has come in bringing a despatch while I write, which I enclose. I cannot too much commend the energy of Col. Thomas with his Regt., the 8th Vermont, who have in six days opened 5½ miles of Rail Road with 9 Culverts, and rebuilt a bridge burned by the enemy, 435 feet long, besides hauling up iron from the track, which entirely impeded locomotives the whole way. In this work they were assisted by the first Native Guards (colored), under the command of Col. Stafford. I have the honor to be,"

I fully agree that the allotment system as at present conducted is a great hindrance to the service. Many men have allotted their whole pay, or all but a dollar or two a month. That money does not reach the families without very considerable delay. It leaves the men nothing for their own necessities, dispirits them, causes them to be discontented and uneasy, and many are trying to be transferred to the regular service, or to other regiments, to get rid of their allotments, and in some cases even deserting. If any remedy can be found, I wish it might be adopted by the War Department. I have the honor to be

To Major R. G. Usher, Paymaster U. S. A.
We the undersigned, members of the Co. ""C,"" 13th Maine Volunteers, do respectfully represent that upon the solicitation of our Field and Company officers at the organization of our regiment, we were induced to take advantage of the allotment system as a safe method to send money to our friends, and one that would facilitate its transmission. But that since the workings of the system has been just the reverse of what was expected, and since no allotted money has been paid for the nine months the system has been in operation, we for these reasons respectfully request that the allotment rolls of Co. ""C"" be given up to our Co. Commander, to insure us hereafter a full payment of our money as U. S. soldiers.

"November, 1862","Translation. New Orleans, November, 1862
Señor General B. F. Butler, Commanding Dept. of the Gulf
Señor General: On the 13th inst. thirty-three Spanish subjects have been released from the public prison where they had been since the 5th inst. One of them has informed me of the manner in which that arrest had been made, and the circumstances which followed, and I beg to bring it to your knowledge, that in future abuses of this character may be avoided.
When, on the 4th inst., they returned from fishing on Lake Borgne and had hardly anchored, they were taken prisoners by some eight soldiers belonging to the U. S. Service at that post. The fishermen showed their certificates of nationality of Spain, issued by this Consulate, but the troop insisted and they obeyed. They were then conducted to the military prison at the Custom-house, and from there to the public prison. Once there, one of the employees, supposed to be the Chief of the Prison, made the offer to the fishermen that if they would
enlist in the U. S. Service they would be released immediately. The prisoners refused, and this was the cause, that they were rudely treated and worse fed, until on the 13th inst. they were released.
Under like circumstances are now confined in the same prison the following Spanish subjects: Basilio Jufante, Juan Antonio, Ambrosio de Luis, Marcelino Saudego, Severo Alez, Juan Mariano, Pedro Pascual, Hilario Villanueva, Lorenzo Francisco, Ignacio de la Cruz, and, as I am told, several more are in the Custom-house prison.
The above-mentioned individuals are peaceable fishermen, who live on the borders of Lake Borgne, where they exercise their industry. To none of them has been reproached any criminal offence, nor has there been taken any declaration, nor do they know by whose order they have been arrested. I suppose that you have no knowledge of these facts. I bring them therefore to your notice, that you may take measures to stop those abuses of your subordinates. I am confident that you will not permit such acts to be repeated, and that you will give orders that hereafter the certificates of nationality, issued by this Consulate, shall be sufficient guaranty of respect for the Spaniards, who keep strict neutrality and observe the laws of the country and obey the constituted authorities. God guard you many years,

In obedience to which I have the honor to report that the parties alluded to were not sent in by Capt. Sawyer. That they were arrested by Serg't. Joseph McQuestion, Co. C., 26th Mass. Vols., then in charge of the Guard at Proctorville, whose statement I have heard. They were arrested in obedience to your Order to respect no passes without your personal signature. None showed any Spanish papers, some had passes from General Shepley, some from Gen. Weitzel. In my opinion it would be impossible to prevent these fishermen from carrying on a contraband traffic to some extent if they are allowed to hover along the coast.
Still, Capt. Sawyer and the man Knox, who seems a man of judgment, thinks some of them might be trusted under a strict surveillance. If they are compelled to quit their fishing it would probably leave them destitute, but we have nothing but their word to depend on for their being faithful.
The man Knox says he has known some of them for many years. I am inclined to trust his judgment to some extent, as he has proved himself very active and faithful so far, and is well acquainted with the coast and people. All of which is respectfully submitted.

"November 25, 1862","New York, Nov. 25th, (1862)
My dear Genl.: Your wife's letter compels me to write plain, simple facts, just as they appear to me. Of all duties ever put upon me, the most disagreeable is to state to a friend, not his three-fourths of nearly perfection, his glorious prospects, his consummate ability, his resolute purposes, all these are agreeable to recapitulate, to use by designing men for selfish purposes, to drown his necessary judgment to success; mine is the task to be plain, to tread the narrow path of the quarter track, to note to my friends the brambles, the thistles, the quick-sands, and the rocks that seem to me to obstruct the easy progress of his hopes that look so green in the distance. I hinted in my former letter the necessity for great care in all commercial enterprises. I find no fact afloat to your prejudice. Still, my dear Genl., the atmosphere is rife with change, with intrigue, with passion, with avarice, coupled with ambition, and you are aimed at among its victims. Always remember, my dear Genl., that the blow aimed at Danton killed Robespierre too. You may still be considered the Danton of the present crisis. Be warned by Danton's or McClellan's death. Imbecility, malignity, and courage surround authority at headquarters. I have industriously explored, since I have been in N. Y., all these attacks. Upon the whole, have come to the conclusion that there is just at present no danger. Now for example:
Chase says: -- Why will Genl. Butler allow his friends to be so loaded, so embarrassed with his commercial connexions.
Garrison: -- George, I tell you (because you are a friend of Butler's) I am afraid he will be removed, indeed I have been afraid of it before now. I tell you there is hell to pay among the merchants. The talk is awful and it has its effect.
Col. Jones: -- I am just from Washington. I tell you before Banks is done he will have Butler's place, etc. Governor Andrew I see about the Astor House, I think for no good.
Seward: I am afraid of the consular affairs; if Butler is changed he will have an important command etc. etc.
Very many lesser lights I could name for examples but the above will suffice for the dark side of the question for condition and discussion in the public mind. Now, then, all this is met by three-fourths of all those who speak of you at all with, ""By God, if they remove Butler I hope the country will sink;"" ""They dare not do it;"" ""Butler is the only live General we have got;"" ""Butler is the right man in the right place;"" ""Butler has the ring of a good General;"" ""Butler is the only Genl. that has done anything,"" etc; ""I have carefully read all of Butler's despatches -- show me any other Genl.'s writing that has the same ring in it, or that begins to; ‘By God, gentlemen, don't talk to me,’"" etc. etc.
Now, my dear Genl. my opinion and advice is you want a friend at court, entire disconnexion of all commercial enterprises. Pursue on, as you have, as a Genl. and I have great hopes. Fisher's and Pierce's visit will accomplish much in allaying, both here and at Washington and at New Orleans, difficulties and surroundings that now lay in the pathway of the future. You now stand high, so high that to fall would crush you. Heed, I beg you, what Fisher may say upon commercial matters. McClellan is out and will die with Burnside's success. Banks' destination was Texas -- his plan to make two free states, etc. He goes now to reinforce Burnside, in my judgment much against his will. All this is well for you. Such is war. Seymour is Gov. of N. Y., and may bring on a collision with the U. S. authorities -- will certainly if writ of Habeas Corpus is denied citizens of N. Y. Such a calamity would change all the future. I have pressed so hard the necessity of Fisher's and Pierce's visit that finally they have concluded to go. I sincerely hope good will grow out of it. So frank, so plain, I know you will believe me an unchanged friend.

To Mrs. Genl. Butler
If the General will allow you to read this letter so that you can make out its meaning I would be glad. I write and spell so badly and oftentimes mean so much more than I say that it often takes the keen eye of a lady to work out its full meaning.

Dear Harriet: Your letter enclosing Mr. Butler's long one came this week. I am glad to hear you have everything ready to send. They are started before now, of course. We thought they might be on board the ""McClellan,"" but nothing is reported. Yesterday I called to see Maria, and was amazed to hear that she expected Nina next week You said nothing about it in your letter, and I could hardly believe it possible that the two would venture on such a voyage. Hope they will reach here all safe and that she will find some pleasure when she gets here for the winter. But there is a doubt expressed about Fisher's coming, yet I shall expect to see him with them. If they have started you must have had a dull Thanksgiving. Blanche writes me she is dull and studies too hard, having no time for recreation. I have written her to take the full time for play, etc.
The London Times is out on Mr. Butler in the ugliest form, calling Jackson a negro stealer, and saying he is a partner of his brother, and that great iniquity has been done in New Orleans, and so forth, taking up two columns and more on the subject. Mr. Butler feels all this, and would not allow his brother about in the same way again. But is this any consolation to me, who knew what the result must be from the first, and have nearly died because I could not prevent it? It is rather terrible that your own government must interfere, and a foreign one comment, before the acts of an individual like that could be stopped. Is it not enough to make
one mad that two years of agony which I have borne, and after I had proved to him that Jackson was the cause of his failure at Fortress Monroe, yet again that he should bestow all power and give all confidence once more, to have his reputation assailed and the power he has and might yet gain, slip from his grasp and crumble to nothing? Banks we hear is already on his way with reinforcements to do the very work we had planned for Mr. Butler. Chase writes to Mr. Butler that Banks will come, but not he thinks to supersede him. And this is all he gets for applying in that quarter. Chase will never help him. This is Major Bell's opinion too, after seeing him last summer. So he has lost one who could and would have served him, and gained, nothing. Has not every word that I have said proved true, and more? My imagination has not cheated me. There is one comfort out of it, only one. This pest has played through and will at last be obliged to go, not soon, I think, to regain his hold; so that there is a chance, if Mr. Butler is again successful, that he will not be at hand to pull him down. But there is yet more that I dread. This man has plunged into everything, and what the final result may be I do not believe he knows. I wish you would suggest to Fisher to have a care, I think he should not answer drafts unless they are Mr. Butler's, but yet I may be wrong. I know Mr. Butler said one day it was not likely that he would answer any but his. But Fisher may be nearly here, and then it will be understood. I shall feel relieved when this man has gone and no more to be dreaded from him.
You wrote that Benny and Hattie were not well. But they must be over it by this. What a dull Thanksgiving for all. Try and make yourselves happy as possible. I have several things to send home, not much value. But nothing yet for Benny. There are some splendid things will be sold, but I do not know how I can buy. The house we are now in is gorgeous with pictures, and statues, and bronzes. However, it is not worth while to talk about it. I may have a chance to send you something.

"November 28, 1862","Private. New Orleans, November 28th, 1862
Dear Sir: I have frequently conversed with Gen'l. Butler about an expedition to Texas, and since it was known here
that Gen. Banks was to command the expedition, I have had two or three conversations with him. The General evidently expected that this expedition would be under his command, and now thinks that Gen. Banks should report to him and act under his orders -- for the following reasons.
1st. Because Ship Island is an inconvenient and, for shipping, a dangerous rendezvous. Most of the steam vessels from New York would be unable to enter the Texas harbors. Gen. Butler would put the troops on board his own light-draught steamers, and wait just in the mouth of the river until fair weather permitted him to run to Galveston in 48 hours. The troops from the sailing vessels could be landed here and the vessels return home, thus saving expense, while a few trips of the General's steamer would convey all the troops to the Texas coast.
2nd. Gen. Butler's troops are acclimated -- well disciplined -- have all been under fire, and the weak and sickly have all been weeded out. Gen. Banks' troops will be new and undisciplined, etc. Gen. Butler would retain the new troops here, and send to Texas an equal number of his veterans, who would form a far more effective force than new troops, and not liable to be weakened by sickness.
3d. A large army could be accommodated in the City with greater ease and comfort than upon Ship Island.
4th. This point is the most convenient depot for supplying Quartermaster and Commissary's stores to Gen. Banks in Texas, and beef and other supplies to be obtained in Texas are most needed here.
5th. When the rebel army retreats from Vicksburg and Port Hudson, they may go west to Texas and crush Gen. Banks' force. This can be prevented by coöperating from this point, and cutting them off by taking Shreveport (on Red River) -- and this coöperation can be efficient only by unity of counsel and command.
6th. The General has prepared four or five iron-clad gunboats, -- the only strong boats on the Gulf coast, capable of operating advantageously in the shallow bays and bayous of Texas.
Such are the reasons I have collected why Gen. Butler should have command, or rather, why Gen. Banks should report to him. These reasons come from Gen. Butler himself. Perhaps others could be given, and perhaps these already stated are not weighty. I thought it proper, at any rate, to state them
to you. Gen. Butler says the above plan would advance the expedition thirty days. Of course, I am ignorant of Gen. Banks' plan of operations. Intelligent Texans now here think the capture of the town of Houston should be the first object. This is the center of railroads and (they say) the controlling position (in military sense) of the state. The slave population is large in that part of the state, and, if properly employed, would prove a source of great weakness to the Rebels.
(George S. Denison)
P. S. I do not know whether Gen. Butler or Gen. Banks is the ranking officer. I have written this letter only that you might be informed of Gen. Butler's opinions. He will soon send troops to Galveston."
"November 28, 1862","Headquarters Department of the Gulf, New Orleans, Nov. 28th, 1862
Hon. Joseph Holt, Judge Advocate General, U. S. A.
Sir: I have the honor to acknowledge the receipt of a letter from your Office of Nov. 21st, relating to the forwarding of copies of the record of a Military Commission. These copies went forward through inadvertence, and I now have the pleasure to enclose the originals.
I trust you will find the proceedings substantially regular. We cannot in the field expect the minute technicality which characterizes the proceedings of Civil Courts, but I believe a substantial justice and right is maintained in the Military Courts.
I observe, in looking at Gen'l. Orders No. 170 current series, that it is said that a Military Commission has not jurisdiction in the case of a spy. I had supposed that a Military Commission, appointed by the Commander of a Department, had jurisdiction of life and death, and I came to this conclusion after an examination of the usage of the service and from historical recollection. It will be remembered that Major André was tried in our service by a Board of Officers. The proceedings by Court Martial are so slow, requiring questions and answers to be in writing, that it is impossible to punish crime so rife in a large city with such a population as ours. I trust your Department has not come to a final determination against the jurisdiction of a Military Commission in that respect.
We are very much embarrassed here because of the want of promptness of punishment. The prompt punishment which I
accorded to offenders when I came here had the most salutary effect, but that has now worn away. It has come to be understood by the villains of New Orleans that no capital punishment can be inflicted even upon them, without the sanction of the President of the United States, and further that he is opposed to capital punishment, and that delays will intervene sufficient to give them the chances of escape which existed under the laws and administration of the Civil Government, so that of sixty-nine murders committed in the State of Louisiana in a single year there was no capital punishment.
I will enclose you a copy of a translation of a cypher letter whereby we have just detected a conspiracy against our elections, to be executed by force, a favorite amusement, by the by, with these people. I believe that I am not usually blood-thirsty, but I am convinced that nothing but the promptest and severest punishment can govern the Carbonari of Italy, the Brigands of Sicily, and the secret Bands of other Nationalities, as well as our own citizens, descendants and comrades of the Pirate Lafitte, -- all congregated here.
Another question of jurisdiction is raised which it is quite important to settle. We have convicted of murder a man who was indicted last March by authority of seceded State of Louisiana, but the Court ran away before his trial, which was set down for the 19th of May. I have addressed your Department upon this question but have as yet received no reply, owing probably to the original record not being sent forward. We have no means of confining such desperate villains. We found them at large a terror to the community. The United States can hardly be responsible for the protection of life and property if we have not this power of punishment.
In one case, which is now pending, a man was tarred and feathered to be driven from the city a few days before we landed. He is now here, and the ""Thug Association"" which did this deed are many of them here, some under an arrest, and those at large are threatening the life of the complainant, in order to drive him away again. Can it be possible that we are powerless to punish such crimes? Awaiting your early reply. I have the honor to be,

Sir: I have the honor to enclose for the information of the Department of State copies and translations of a correspondence between Admiral Reynaud and myself upon the subject of the imprisonment of Alfred and Jules Lemore. As these will form a part of the papers relating to the case of the French Consul and the ""New Orleans Bank,"" I have transmitted them directly to the Department of State.
It will be observed, in his reply, that the Admiral does not deny or remark upon the claim of Alfred Lemore, that his papers were concealed on board the ""Catinat"" a French Ship of War.
Most respectfully, Your obedient Servant,

Translation. New Orleans, Nov. 17th, 1862 Major General Butler, Commanding Dept. of the Gulf
General: After the interview which I had the honor to have with you last Friday 14th inst., and in which you had
the complaisance to communicate to me the different papers relating to the affair ""Gautherin & Co.,"" and in consequence of remarks which it was my duty to make to you, I had left you with the conviction that Messrs. Lemore would be detained only provisionally until a regular Court would decide upon the offence with which they were charged, namely, to be engaged in an unlawful commerce with the government of the Confederate States; it is in this sense that I have rendered an account to my government by the mail which left last Saturday.
I have just learned that Mr. Alfred Lemore is confined in Fort Pickens, not to suffer a provisional imprisonment, but with the order of close confinement at hard labor, with ball and chain, and that Mr. Jules Lemore is to leave today for Fort Jackson, in the same conditions.
These measures are so serious that I must doubt the veracity of the assertion. But not having the means to verify it, I should be much obliged to you, General, if you would let me know the present position of these gentlemen, and the nature of the orders which you thought proper to give in their regard. However, if against my expectation, Mr. Alfred Lemore has been submitted to such treatment without that legal forms have been respected, without that the Consul of France has been informed, I should see myself with regret in the necessity to support near you the official protest which in this case Mr. Mejan would have to address to you, against an order which would be outside of all regular legislation. Please accept, General, the assurance of my high consideration.
Reynaud,
The Contre Admiral commanding in chief the naval division of the Gulf and North America."
"November 18, 1862","Headquarters, Department of the Gulf, New Orleans, Nov. 18, 1862
Admiral Reynaud, French Marine Service
Admiral: You were quite correct in your understanding of the conversation upon the subject of the disposition made of Alfred and Jules Lemore, with which you did me the honor to favor me. I have at present detained them for trial, which I propose will take place immediately after the affair upon the Conlon plantation can be investigated, which you desired should have the preference, as soon as the case now before
the military Commission is finished. In the meantime, I have ordered Jules Lemore to Fort Jackson for safe keeping till further orders, and as I don't think the United States is bound to clothe and feed anybody without an equivalent, I have directed him to be put to work.
The case of Alfred Lemore stands differently in this, that he treated my authority with contempt, refused to answer all proper questions put to him in regard to the matter of the bank, and contumaciously, contemptuously, and utterly refused to produce certain papers which were within his control, necessary to my investigation of the affairs of the Bank of New Orleans.
For this contempt of all authority on the part of a confessed criminal, I directed that until Lemore would produce the papers he should be confined closely, and as we are quite unprepared at Fort Pickens for means of certain confinement, I added the ball and chain.
This portion of his confinement Lemore can at any time alleviate by producing the papers as required. He intimated in the presence of the Directors of the Bank that these papers were on board your ship, the ""Catinat,"" an idea I at once repelled as it was not possible that a French ship-of-war could be the willing custodian of the evidence of guilt of any person.
The form of the order of confinement of the Lemores, ""till further orders,"" will show you that the imprisonment is merely provisional. I can't look upon the crime of the Lemores in the light you seem to do. While living in this city in June last under the protection of the United States they were engaged in delivering clothing to the Rebel army to the amount of more than two million francs.
There can be no doubt as to the heinousness of the crime of those foreigners who, living here, aid in the rebellion. The native rebel has the palliation that his association, his training, his education, his sympathies, and perhaps almost necessities have led him into acts of treason. Not so the alien of the rebellion. He has been warned of the heinousness of his offence against a sovereign proclamation, he has no ties or associations, he has no state rights doctrines, imbibed from childhood's teachings, to mislead him, he has no country here to save or ruin. He is merely the voluntary guest of a nation which protects him, and grants him more commercial advantages than he believes his own country affords him, -- and this nation he aids to destroy. His acts, if done by a citizen, are
treason. His have all the moral guilt of treason. He breaks the laws of hospitality of the country whose subject he is, and the laws of the country whose protection and home he enjoys. His only excuse is greed and gain -- the love of the thirty pieces of silver which Judas got for betraying his master from the same motive.
You may be sure, Admiral, that the imprisonment of the Lemores is not definitive punishment, for if the military tribunal before whom their case shall be brought take the same view of the heinousness of their offence that I do, and if the proof is undoubted, their punishment is likely to be much more suited to the depth of their guilt.
While, however, I claim, and in a proper case should exercise, the right and power to try and judge, and if found guilty to sentence these men myself, as the highest authority here, I repeat that at the earliest possible moment these men shall be tried by an impartial commission of officers of rank, appointed before they were arrested.
Meanwhile, I claim the right to protect myself and my Government from the contumacious acts of those who are engaged in an attempt to overthrow it, whether alien or native-born.
I have the honor to assure you, Admiral, of my most sincere respect and personal esteem.

"November 29, 1862","Private. Headquarters, Department of the Gulf, New Orleans, Nov. 29, 1862
To the President of the United States
My dear Sir: I take the liberty of addressing you, not as Chief Magistrate and Commander-in-Chief, but as a friend and a kind and just man.
I think I have a right to give you the exact state of facts personally to myself. I see by the papers that Gen'l. Banks is about being sent into this Department with troops upon an independent expedition and command. This seems to imply a want of confidence in the Commander of this Department, perhaps deserved, but still painful to me. In my judgment it will be prejudicial to the public service to attempt any expedition into Texas without making New Orleans a base of supplies and co-operation, to do this there must be but one head, and one Department. I do not propose to argue the question here -- still further is it from my purpose to suggest even that there may not be a better head than the one now in the Department. I beg leave to call your attention that since I came into the field, the day after your first proclamation,
that I have ever been in the frontier line of the rebellion -- Annapolis when Washington was threatened, Relay House when Harper's Ferry was being evacuated, Baltimore, Fort Monroe, Newport News, Hatteras, Ship Island, New Orleans. It is not for me to say with what meed of success. But I have a right to say that I have lived at this station exposed at once to the pestilence and the assassin for eight months, awaiting reinforcements which the needs of the Government could not give me until now. And now they are to be given to another. I have never complained. I do not now complain. I have done as well as I could everything which the Government asked me to do. I have eaten that which was set before me asking no questions.
It is safe now for any person to come to New Orleans and stay. It has been demonstrated that the Quarantine can keep away the fever. The assassins are overawed or punished.
Why, then, am I left here when another is sent into the field in this Department? If it is because of my disqualification for the service, in which I have as long an experience as any General in the United States Army now in the service (being the Senior in rank), I pray you say so, and so far from being even aggrieved, I will return to my home, consoled by the reflection that I have at least done my duty as far as endeavor and application goes. I am only desirous of not being kept where I am not needed or desired. And I will relieve the Administration of all embarrassment. Pray do me the favor to reflect that I am not asking for the command of any other person, but simply that, unless the Government service require it, my own, which I have a right to say has not been the least successful of the War, shall not be taken from me in such a manner as to leave me all the burden without any of the results.
Permit me also to say that towards General Banks, who is selected to be the leader of the Texas expedition, I have none but the kindest feelings, he having been my personal friend for years, and still being so.
Writing about my personal affairs, which I have never done before, I hardly know how to express myself, but what I mean is this: If the Commander-in-chief find me incompetent (unfaithful I know he cannot), let me be removed and be allowed to meet the issue before him and my country, but as I never do anything by indirection myself, all I ask of the President, as a just man, is that the same course may be taken toward me.
I have told you before, what you well know, that I have not acted with you politically, but I defy all and any to show a political act of mine since I left my hearth-stone for my country's service
1 . . . whenever and wherever a friend would be influenced by me. Allow me to repeat again, Sir, what I have before said, although the determination may cause my recall, put the Department which includes Louisiana and Texas under one head, and it will be best for the service. I pray you, Sir, not to misunderstand me. I have given up something for my country, can give up more. And this command is a small matter in comparison, in my mind, to my own self-respect, or to the good of the service.
I do not seek to embarrass the Government by any action of mine, or in regard to myself. Far from it. I would even take myself away rather than to do anything which would weaken by one ounce the strength with which the administration should strangle this rebellion.
I have written, therefore, this present note to the President, so that if no action should be had upon it, there need be no official embarrassment. With sentiments of esteem and respect, I am,
Most truly, your friend, Benj. F. Butler

Maj. Gen. Halleck, Commanding in Chief, U. S. Army
General: The enemy has concentrated a large force -- not less probably than ten thousand men, some excellent authorities stating the number as high as fifteen thousand -- at Fort Hudson. The position is naturally a strong one -- stronger even it is believed than Vicksburg. The design of the enemy is to fight the great battle for the possession of the Mississippi at that point. For the want of a sufficient land force -- the Navy say they must have ten thousand men at least -- I have been compelled to postpone a projected attack upon the position. It might have been taken by five regiments five weeks since had I had troops sufficient to hold it.
As the case stands now, it will be easy, with a force as large as that of the enemy, to compel him to give battle elsewhere, if, in no other way, certainly by drowning him out by destroying
the Levee above him. Brig. General Sherman is now engaged in exploring the country above here, on the left bank of the river, with a view to movement which may take place hereafter. He has reached a point within six miles of Baton Rouge, meeting no force of the enemy.
It is believed that before the middle of January we shall be compelled to withdraw General Weitzel's force to the other side of the Bayou Lafourche, as by that time the lower Teche Country and the country from Lafourche to Brashier City will be flooded from the Red River neighborhood. The levees being much out of repair, no means are in our power to ward off the impending danger.
The levees on the right bank far above are in the hands of the enemy, and totally neglected by him, and the conformation of the country such that the overflow will extend hundreds of miles. This will be a serious blow to the people of that country, already great sufferers from the effects of the war, and most of whom are ready and most heartily anxious to return to their allegiance.

Sir: A bounty having been offered by the Federal Government for soldiers that should be recruited under the provision
of the offer, there were enlisted in this Department, and before the order discontinuing the bounty reached us, a large portion of a regiment, being the Second Louisiana Vols. There was no other State Regt. in which these recruits could be consolidated, there was nothing left for me but to continue the recruiting. The regiment was afterwards filled. It is but justice to these men, and sustaining the faith of the Government, as they were promised this bounty, that they should be paid. It can be done, however, by the Superintendent of recruiting only by the Order of the War Department. Such Order is respectfully asked.
Another class of cases arises -- that of men enlisted here into the old regiment under the same promises and before the Order discontinuing the bounty reached us.
Another class still -- a large number recruited after the Order was issued and before it came here.
Are these to be paid? They claim it, and by the letter their claim must be allowed. But it is not so just as theirs who enlisted under its inducements between the time when the Order was issued and when it reached this Department. I have the honor to be,

Sir: You will remember that the banks of this city sent away about four millions of their specie upon the advent of our troops in the city. They have made application to the Confederate authorities to bring it back, but have been refused.
The banks now desire that I would permit their specie in the Confederacy to be put upon a war vessel of some foreign power and sent either to France or England, or to be kept there safely till after the termination of the war, the money to be under the care of two agents, one appointed by the banks and the other by the Confederate Government. All this to be done, of course, only if the Richmond people consent. To effect this arrangement, I informed the agent of the banks I could not consent to apply to the department, because of the great need that the Confederacy have of gold in Europe. The agent of the banks might be corrupted by the Confederate Agent, and the money when there applied to Confederate
uses. But that if the representative of the foreign Government near Washington, upon whose vessel that coin might be placed, would pledge his Government that the money should be kept intact, unpledged, and undrawn upon during the war, to be then returned to the banks in specie after peace, I thought the Department might entertain the proposition.

Dear General: Dexter has exceeded my authority in drawing upon me for very large sums at short sight, to such an extent that I have found myself obliged in self defence to protest a large draft of his for non-acceptance. If he sends forward Bills of Lading of merchandise in time to cover his bill before its maturity, I shall probably pay it. If not, it must go back, and he must take care of it as best he may. I shall be very sorry to have his credit in New Orleans injured, but he has brought it on himself by such recklessness in the use of my money and credit that there was no alternative.
So far as I can see there is no possible combination of circumstances which, even under these trials, can affect my solvency, but I may be very much embarrassed for a time, and I do not intend you should have a moment's uneasiness or risk, and I have therefore made you a remittance (as advised in a business letter of this date) of a cargo of merchandise which will cover your balance on my hands, about $33,000.
I have ordered Mr. Dexter to turn over to Colonel Butler (or in his absence to you) all the interests I have in New Orleans, which, with other arrangements I am making here, will in like manner secure him. I have cancelled Mr. Dexter's authority to act for me on any further business, and ask as a favor that if he hesitates in acceding to my instructions you will advertise my revocation of his power of attorney, and take my interests under your own protection.
I cannot imagine anything short of mania which can have induced Dexter to go so wild. I have known him for years as a merchant of large experience, and as an honorable, warm-hearted man, to whom I would trust anything I possessed. It was in a strong feeling of personal regard that I sent him to New Orleans, to give him the opportunity to make a fresh start, and repair the loss of fortune caused by a dishonest associate. I still have the fullest confidence in his integrity, and it is with the deepest regret I now find myself obliged to act so peremptorily, but I cannot, in my unwillingness to hurt his feelings, allow myself to be involved any deeper in speculation.
Everything goes well with the Middlesex. We shall divide 10%. You are on the whole the popular favorite just now (no great honor), but, what is better worth having, I do not hear a dissenting voice from the opinion among my own best acquaintances that you have done more real service and shown greater ability in separate command than any other of our own Commanders. Long may your success continue, as ever,
Faithfully yours, Richard S. Fay, Jr.
If you like, I have no objection to Colonel Butler and Mr. Dexter seeing this letter. Of course you will not have time to manage the ""Emblem"" merchandise yourself. Select your own agent, and let him render his accounts to me through you. You may know of circumstances which may render Dexter's conduct excusable. If so, I would be happy to have him manage this stuff, unless the Colonel prefers to do so."

I must add a little more. There are some things about Banks' coming that I think are well. If he comes with an independent command into Mr. Butler's department, for Texas is a part of it, Mr. Butler can ask to be recalled -- and by that means we can return early in the spring. Otherwise, if the reinforcements were sent to him, he might from necessity be obliged to stay another summer. I had rather Banks came than accept that alternative. Seward wrote by the last mail more conciliatory. Say this to Capt. G., if Fisher has started. Now I think Mr. B. might be ready to look in that direction. The other parties have failed him. But I will write to the Capt. as soon, tell him, as the next mail comes in. I shall urge Mr. B. to meet promptly any kindly overtures from S. I think I may send a box not by this vessel but the next.

Sir: I have the honor to report that the ""Diana"" has arrived from Petit Ause Bayou, and that the ""Kinsman"" is still aground on the bar. Captain Weeks has been relieved from the ""Diana"" to be tried by a Court Martial, and Act. Master Goodwin from the ""Hartford"" has been ordered in his place. Captain Wiggins writes me word that he cannot get off until he gets a high tide, and that he is perfectly safe and has plenty of coal and provisions. His boilers are in a very bad condition, however. The boats all require some repairs. I have sent the ""Diana"" up Grand Lake, and when she comes back I will lay her up for repairs.
Captain McMillan wished me to make a statement to you in regard to some store which was ransacked upon our arrival here. Captain Wiggins reported to me that the store had been broken open by the soldiers and sailors, and that there was a great deal of paint and rope laying about, some of it outside, and that it would be of use to us. I ordered him to get it on board, and to find out to whom it belonged and give a receipt for it. The paint we wanted, as also we did the rope for our guns. We had broken most all our back lanyards, and this stuff suited exactly. Captain Wiggins said he could find no person to give a receipt to, and I told him to keep it ready. The store was broken open two or three times, and a great many things were taken out by the citizens of this place. I caught some of my men with plates and canned meats, which I sent back and had the men punished. There was no person to look out for it, and therefore every person I presume helped themselves.
I would respectfully call your attention to the following case of mine, which if not inconsistent with your duty I would request it to be allowed. On the 6th of November, five days after our arrival here, I sent the ""Diana"" up the lake to bring away 255 bales of cotton, which Mr. Lod, the owner, had requested me to seize to prevent the Confederates from burning
it. Mr. Lod went with the boat and showed where it was, and came down here the next day and offered to sell the cotton. He represented himself as a loyal citizen, and said he wished to take the oath. As I thought I could make some money, and not thinking that under the circumstances I would be doing anything wrong, I bought the cotton. I was not then aware of your General Order No. 91, and as soon as I saw it I sent it in to Col. J. W. Shaffer. Mr. Lod has taken the Oath of Allegiance, and has looked to us for protection ever since our arrival here although he lives outside of our lines.
I bought the cotton in good faith, and this is the first time I have ever had an opportunity of making anything outside of my pay, and if you can consistently let me have it I would be greatly obliged to you. I have written to the Commission, and have appointed Col. A. J. Butler my agent to receive it, if you will let me have it. I am,

Col. Joseph Holt, Judge Advocate General, U. S. A.
Col.: Your letter of Nov. 17th, concerning the steamer ""Morning Light,"" has been received. The steamboat was long since delivered to William Dillon, who seems to be an honest owner, and to have been defrauded by his agent in whose care he entrusted her, and who sold her to the Confederates.
That sale raised the only doubt in my mind as to restoring her. But upon personal examination I found the sale had
been made with an intent to defraud Dillon, and thereupon, although she was captured from Rebel owners, I ordered her restoration. I have never claimed salvage where property has been seized by the Confederates, being at the time of the seizure the property of loyal owners, and I am glad that my determination coincides with that of the Sec'y of War upon this point.
I think the administration of this department is as little liable to censure as that of any other in treating the Rebels otherwise than as Rebels. My belief has been that we were a little in advance on that subject, and I beg leave to assure you that I shall be the last to recognize the Confederates as belligerents.
Upon this matter of captured steamboats, however, the truth is that most of the boats were left by their Northern owners in the hands of agents who sold them to the Rebels, and they were used in that service and Confederate registers were taken out for them. In such cases I deem the property fit to be confiscated to the United States, and I have refused to return the boats. But when I have returned a boat I have never made a claim for salvage, than this may be considered such a claim, I have refused to pay for the use of boats between the time of recapture and the time of delivery to the claimant.
I think it enough for the Government to recapture, preserve, and restore the property to owners, generally deprived of it, by the act of their own agents, without paying for its intermediate use, or, to use the illustration given in your letter, the rebel being considered in the light of a robber who has taken an honest man's purse, and the officer of the Gov't. when they rescue it, being bound to restore it, I think the party robbed could with no good grace make a claim for interest on the money while it was in the hands of the officer.

Gentlemen: Your communication of 6th instant, relating to the Phoenix Iron Co., is received. I am informed and believe, and you will correct me if I am wrong, that the Phoenix Iron Co.'s works were leased to Mr. Busac, and with the
knowledge and consent of the company were used by him as a foundry for the Rebels, making shot, shell, and ordnance, and that there are now on the premises such machinery and partly-finished ordnance, Mr. Busac having run away, leaving these evidences of his rebellious trade behind him. It may be true that your clients instituted in the rebel court, when presided over by a rebel judge under authority of a rebel state, a suit for the division of spoils between rebels, which had been acquired by working for the rebel government. I am now called upon to confirm the Provisional Seizure of the Court of this Rebel property, in favor of Rebels, and to allow the present Courts established by the United States to sit in judgment upon this claim. If I am not mistaken in the above recited facts, the Court will not prostitute itself to such work. Lord Mansfield said, in deciding a case where the plaintiff was before him with much cleaner hands than your clients seem to have, that the Court of Kings Bench would not sit to divide spoils between the highwaymen. I trust that Courts established under the authority of the United States will not sit to divide profits or adjudicate rents between the owners and occupants of rebel foundries. Unless, therefore, it can be shown to me that I am wholly misinformed in the above state of facts, I shall direct my Quartermaster not only to retain the iron he has taken, but to seize the rest for the use of the United States, and shall ask your clients to show cause why they should not be tried for treason, in aiding the Rebellion by furnishing a place for the manufacture of arms for traitors.

Sir: The 1st Texas Cavalry has been recruited with[out] bounty or expense to the Government to the number of about 150 men. I am about sending it to Galveston, where it is expected to fill up its ranks from the same class of people who have enlisted in it here. I have therefore had to find it officers and an organization. These officers most of them are Texas Refugees, and deserving non-commissioned officers of my command, and in either case sadly in need of their pay to meet their increased expense.
Under General Orders No. 61, series of 1861, I am not allowed to muster them into the service, although I have given them provisional commissions under the authority of the Department. I think that a special order, giving them their pay from their actually acting, which is the date of their commissions,
will be just, and I desire authority so to do. Awaiting instructions, I have the honor to be,

General: I have the honor to enclose to you specifications, drawing, and model of a roof for the Custom House at New Orleans. It is a building which has already cost the United States millions of dollars. It is left without a roof, and is crumbling away under the effects of the weather.
To leave it uncovered during the winter and spring will be exceedingly disastrous and expensive. Besides, it is the citadel of New Orleans, and we have found it necessary to have it roofed, and we have devised a plan which you will understand from the drawings. I think the work can be done within the estimates. I am now changing the plan so far as to adopt the fitting composition roof, instead of shingling, by which we shall save the cost of the gutters.
If this were not a matter of prime necessity I should not believe the expense justifiable. The whole matter I had put in charge of Gen. Arnold, the Military Commandant of the city; but his being struck by paralysis caused delay until this time. We shall have all that is necessary done in much less time than three months. We hope to have it nearly completed by the time we receive the answer to this. I shall be able to employ upon it many laborers whom I am now feeding. I have the honor to be,

Major General B. F. Butler
Dear General: While no one appreciates more highly than myself the energetic, persevering, and skilful merchant, I must confess that no one has a greater abhorrence and detestation of the unscrupulous speculator who takes advantage of every necessity of his fellow-beings, and, regardless of consequences, by bribery and corruption forces his trade into the
enemy's country, drawing down dishonor upon the cause as well as the country we serve, and upon us who are exerting every nerve to sustain our honor among nations, and even claim the respect of our enemies, however unwilling they may be to yield it. I have therefore determined to call to your attention the case of the Schooner ""L. L. Davis,"" whose cargo is owned by one Mr. Wyer of New Orleans.
Lieut. Comdr. Read reported to me, sometime since, that this vessel was fitting out avowedly for Matamoras, but it was intimated to him that she was intended to run the blockade by going into some intermediate port he might find unguarded. I directed him to watch her closely, and as soon as she left the precincts of the Civil and Military jurisdiction of New Orleans to examine his papers carefully, and see that all was right. He did so, and reported her papers all signed by the proper authorities. She sailed -- and it now appears that instead of going through the Rigolets, she changed her course and ran over to Pontchatoula, the well-known depot of the Confederates. On calling upon Mr. Denison, the Collector, for information of this vessel, he informed me that he had been unwilling to give clearances to vessels for Matamoras, and that he had stated to Mr. Wyer (in the case of the ""L. L. Davis"") that his cargo was unsuited to the place; to which he replied ""never mind,"" and appeared indifferent as to the Collector's opinion; which now, as the result is seen, leaves but little doubt in my mind that she was originally intended by Mr. Wyer to go precisely where she did, and I call your attention to the facts, General, in order that the affair may be properly investigated, and Mr. Wyer dealt with according to law. This and similar things are the theme of public discussion, and bring discredit upon the whole of us, for it is said publicly that it could not be done without the connivance of the authorities, a charge which I am sure we all desire to avoid by a fair investigation. All of which is respectfully submitted by

"December 10, 1862","Unofficial New Orleans, December 10th, 1862
Dear Sir: I send this letter by Mr. Flanders, who leaves to-day for Washington, and suggest that you talk fully with him concerning affairs here. I mean military and political affairs, with which he is quite familiar. You can rely perfectly on the integrity of Mr. F. An occurrence has just taken place which causes me to feel much indignation and some chagrin.
Col. Butler has three or four men in his employ who manage his business for him. The principal one is Mr. Wyer. Some days ago Wyer loaded a vessel for Matamoras. She was loaded in the New Basin, and when she got into the lake, ran into Pontchatoula.
This information reached me two days ago, and since then I have been investigating the matter, and am satisfied that it was a pre-determined plan to take the cargo to Pontchatoula for the rebels, instead of going to Matamoras. I am also satisfied that Col. Butler was the sole owner of the cargo.
The vessel was the Schooner ""L. L. Davis,"" 95 tons burden, and 500 sacks salt was the greater portion of her cargo. This is worth in Rebeldom the astonishing price of
$150. per sack. Cotton could be bought there at not more than 15 cts. per pound, and delivered at some point on the Mississippi whence it could be brought hither. Near Matamoras salt is abundant and cheap. I expressed astonishment to Wyer when he cleared' the vessel, that he should send salt to that port, but he pretended to have information that he could get a good price for it.
I have just been to see Gen. Butler, and laid the whole matter before him, with statement of proof that the ""Davis"" was loaded with intention to run the blockade. I cannot give this statement in one letter, but it is sufficient to say that Gen. Butler expressed himself perfectly satisfied that such was the intention. I then told him I believed Col. Butler was the owner of the cargo -- & gave my reasons.
Gen. Butler assures me he will immediately investigate the matter thoroughly, & if Col. Butler, or those associated with him, are interested in the operation, he & they shall instantly leave the Department of the Gulf. He manifested great indignation which I cannot believe feigned, judging from his appearance. I am confident I can bring forward sufficient proof to convince any honest jury that the vessel is Col. Butler's, and that he intended to take the cargo to Rebels. This statement I intend to make to Gen. Butler to-morrow morning, so that, if he please, he can permit me to collect and present the evidence.
Yesterday I had a long conversation with Admiral Farragut, who holds the same opinion regarding this matter as myself.
The gunboat at the mouth of New Canal is the ""New London,"" commanded by Capt. Read (Lieut. Commanding). I am afraid he will be made to suffer -- but it would be very unjust, for he was not deficient in vigilance, and is an honest and faithful officer. I am more in fault than he is, for I allowed myself to be deceived -- though any man, however vigilant, would have been deceived in the same manner.
I shall report to you promptly this progress and result of the investigation. Please excuse the hasty manner in which I am obliged to write.

Dear Harriet: The time runs by, and two months have gone since I left home. A fortnight ago and I thought it likely enough we should be home at Christmas. But I do not feel so sure of it now, yet I think the chances are we return this winter. We look for the next mail with considerable eagerness, as that may settle it one way or another. It is far better to go now than run the risk of another summer. You would be amazed to know how closely my time is occupied, and yet I do nothing. Other people with their calls, wants, and troubles, take up my time. This, with observing and gathering up the thread of things that run wild, is all I can attend to. I usually have a budget for Mr. Butler when evening comes, which I try to make as little distasteful as possible.
Last night I told him of a story I had heard during the day. That J -- n was engaged in one of the largest gambling houses here -- that two sporting men from California carried it on ostensibly, but one of them is his partner in other things, and he is secretly himself a partner in the gambling house. We are not through with results from this creature yet. Mr. B. says he goes from here in ten days, but where? To Havana, where he intends to take blood horses taken here from the finest stud in America. So with gambling and horse-racing he will still manage to have his name ahead of the Gen'l. Mr. B. has great energy, and has found ways to rise however great the pressure, but this fellow has gone as near to blast him as he can and miss it, of that I am quite sure. Nor do I feel at all certain that he has missed it. There may be a stigma left that cannot be wiped out.
I have packed a box with the bronze clock I wrote you Mr. B. bought and some books to keep it in place, and in the crevices I have dropped pecan nuts for the children. An old torn volume of ""Robinson Crusoe"" for Paul to read. You must tell him the beginning of the story. I think he has never read it. I want to send you something, and could do so, but I am afraid of the conveyance. The clock you can put on the mantel in my room. I do not much fancy it, but it is bought and must be sent along. The other books you can put aside. There is a picture book, square with a blue cover and rather worn, that will please the children, ""A Foreign Tour"" I think it is called. The little book of heraldry do not give them.
Poor Benny and Hatty, are they never to get anything? We were at a dinner party last Sunday at Mr. Durant's, a lawyer here. Among other things they gave us for dessert delicious candy made of roasted almonds pounded, and sugar. If I could send a box of that, how the children would like it. I begin to doubt if Fisher or Read will come, things have such an uncertain look. However, if they are coming they have already started. I hope you are not greatly troubled about domestic affairs. If Timothy goes with Gen. Banks I may possibly see him here. Love to all.

Major General Butler, New Orleans, La.
Dear Sir: This morning I wrote to you somewhat at length, and in concluding stated I would again write to you to-day; and having some leisure I take the opportunity of ful-filling this promise.
The removal of General McClellan from the command of the army of the Potomac occasioned great surprise at the North. By the Democrats -- that is I mean by the democratic politicians and editors -- it was considered not only a blunder, but crime; by the republicans it was deemed an act of justice, and to the outcries of their opponents they maliciously referred to the removal of General Fremont some twelve months ago. But by the great body of the people the measure was looked upon as being made by the Executive with the best intentions -- namely, to insure a vigorous prosecution of the War, as well as to promote harmony between the War Department and the generals in the field. As to Gen. Burnside, all commended his appointment -- the removal of General McClellan having previously been made. Had General Banks or Fremont received the command, the administration would have been liable to the charge of partisanship, so recklessly made against it by men who, lacking patriotism themselves, believe our rulers to lack it likewise.
Some of the friends of General McClellan confidently affirm that he will be made General-in-Chief vice Halleck Jan. 1st. This appears so grossly improbable that I almost fear I do wrong in mentioning it. I have pretty good authority for asserting that Mr. Lincoln intends to decline a re-nomination for the Presidency in 1864, and that it is well understood in official circles that General Banks, should he continue as popular as he is now, is to be the Republican candidate for that position. Should this be the case, it is highly probable that a Democrat will be named for Vice-President, to give the ticket additional influence with the people. Whether this be so or not, it is certain that the wind sets in the quarter I have indicated.
When is Mobile to be captured by our forces? It is possible that General Banks' expedition may have sailed for that quarter? -- but I have always imagined that the honor of reducing the Metropolis of Alabama would fall to yourself;
and that having redeemed New Orleans you would in like manner redeem Mobile from Secession rule.
The election of Messrs. Flanders and Hahn as representatives in Congress from New Orleans is variously commented upon by the northern newspapers according to their political proclivities. For instance, the Democratic press assume that the election is an attempt on the part of the Administration to secure for themselves a majority in the next Congress, which otherwise would be democratic; that it is, in fine, an odious conspiracy to over-ride public opinion. This assumption can only be maintained on the ground first that there are no loyal citizens in New Orleans to be represented in Congress -- or second that the National troops stationed in that city exercised the right of suffrage, and thus nullified the will of the people. As these premises are wanting, the election is of course valid, and must be respected accordingly.
The bill for the admission of West Virginia as a state into the Union has passed the House of Representatives, and now only needs the President's signature to become a law. This proposed enactment also excites the ire of the opponents of the Administration, who indignantly exclaim that Mr. Lincoln violates the Constitution for partisan purposes. Here again are they mistaken. Mr. Lincoln being a practical man, looks at the subject in all its lights and shadows. He knows it is possible we may not be able to subdue all the revolted states; although believing, as I also believe, that it will be done.
Hence, to secure ourselves every possible safeguard against ill-fortune, ought we not to detach from the rebellious states every foot of ground we can obtain during the progress of hostilities? In my opinion clearly so. And every inch of territory so obtained must never be yielded. By pursuing this course we shall conquer the South by piecemeal -- leaving to our main armies the work of destroying those of the Rebels.
It is much to be regretted that at a time like this there should be two parties in the North. The influence of the President's Emancipation Proclamation was the signal for partisan men to range themselves either on one side or the other. I had hoped that your wise counsels to your friends in Massachusetts in 1861 to support Governor Andrew, differing from him widely as you did in his anti-slavery opinions, would have been productive of lasting results. The administration has been defeated in New York, New Jersey, Pennsylvania, and Ohio, in the first-named as well as in the latter
two states by majorities which would probably have been overcome had the Volunteers therefrom been allowed to vote. For my own part, I think that during the continuance of this war, and so long as the Administration does not wilfully violate the Constitution, it is the duty of every voter remaining at home to sustain the government in its great work of suppressing the rebellion.
The report of the Secretary of the Treasury discloses an amount of expenditure hardly covered by a thousand million of dollars. Of this sum, enormous as it is, the major part has, I presume, been expended upon the Army: contractors and sub-contractors, commissaries and assistant commissaries have doubtless reaped extraordinary profits -- profits altogether disproportioned to their service. While the war lasts these things continue, nay, must increase. And the unhappy man who has the vast responsibilities of the Treasury Department resting upon him can do no more than endeavor to detect fraud, and vigilantly guard the public deposits when the attempt in a majority of cases is, after all, doomed to failure.
Galveston having been occupied by our forces, it becomes a question whether they will attempt to penetrate any distance in the interior. Houston, the capital of, I think, Harris county, ought to be seized and occupied at the earliest possible moment. This is the great cotton mart of Texas, and surpasses in importance even Galveston itself. I hope this matter will receive early attention. Business at the Custom House of New York has greatly decreased of late owing to the heavy duties imposed by the new tariffs. Secretary Chase estimates that $70,000,000 receipts from customs will be made during the present fiscal year; but he is too sanguine. Between $50,000,000 and $60,000,000 will be nearer the amount.
It now seems probable that the system of so-called ""arbitrary arrests"" up to but recently pursued by the War Department will be soon entirely abandoned, as a portion of our truly loyal people have taken umbrage at the measure, which they foolishly believe to be destructive of their rights, forgetting that it is only the disloyal who really suffer in the majority of cases, and that by their own act.
Absurd statements relating to ""Overtures for Peace,"" said to have come from Jeff Davis, are afloat; but generally discredited by the press. There is no truth in them; and they are brought forth only by the near approach of the 1st of January.
General McDowell's court martial will beyond question result in his honorable acquittal of all charges preferred either against his honor as a soldier or his ability as a commander of a corps. Public opinion, which in this case is undoubtedly correct, declares General McDowell to have been simply unfortunate. In the course of the trial (which will soon be terminated) General McClellan was called to the witness stand, and deposed or rather gave it as his opinion that had he at any time during the Peninsular campaign been re-enforced by the 35,000 men commanded by McDowell, he could have taken Richmond! This statement is now going the rounds of the press, and as might be expected creates a sensation. It appears from the evidence (documentary) given that McDowell was by the express orders of the President and the Secretary of War prohibited from effecting a junction with McClellan during the continuance of Jackson's raid in the Shenandoah Valley (in whose pursuit General McDowell ineffectually participated), and for some time thereafter, notwithstanding, as an ex parte statement has it, more than 40,000 troops remained to guard Washington with a large reserve at Baltimore. Now the question comes up, who was responsible for McClellan's failure on the peninsula?
Now, a week or ten days ago there was published an official statement from General Halleck with regard to this very subject. General Halleck states in brief that after the seven days battles before Richmond, he called upon General McClellan, and a discussion took place as to the (future) plans of the war department. In the evening, General McClellan stated that with 50,000 fresh troops he could take Richmond; being assured that not more than 20,000 could be furnished, he took the night to reflect upon the subject. In the morning he stated that with 20,000 men he would make an attempt, and stood ""some chance"" of success. It was then understood that this number (all that could be spared, including McDowell's Corps) should be given General McClellan, provided the concurrence of the President thereto should be obtained. But just prior to or upon General Halleck's arrival at Washington, he received a telegram from General McClellan to the effect that he (McClellan) could not or would not make the attempt without being reinforced by 35,000 troops, 15,000 more than the number agreed upon. Thereupon General Halleck telegraphed in reply to commence the evacuation of the peninsula -- which movement was commenced fourteen
days thereafter, General McClellan having in the interim strongly remonstrated against it, to which remonstrance General Halleck replied at length, and in defense of his order.
I confess that the testimony given before the McDowell court martial materially disagrees with the statement of General Halleck, who stated that he could not give McClellan more than 20,000 troops (including McDowell's corps), while McClellan or some other General affirms that nearly 70,000 men were left in northern Virginia, the District of Columbia, Baltimore, and Fortress Monroe, when the peninsular campaign was undertaken, and that at the time of Jackson's raid McDowell had 35,000 men. It is clear that somebody was mistaken, but who, it is hard to say.
The Emperor Napoleon has recently seen fit to endeavor to obtain England's rulers to concur with him in offering mediation in the affairs of this country, preliminary to an armistice taking place between the contending parties. Earl Russell, who, whatever his shortcomings in other respects, is certainly a clear-headed and practical Statesman, perceiving that such an offer would be at once rejected, and do no good whatever, rejects the proposition. I have no idea that armed intervention is likely to occur for many months, if ever; and if it does come, it will do more to promote a restoration of the Union than otherwise. Such at least is my opinion.
I have written at much greater length than I intended when I commenced, and will therefore close with the remark that I hope you will not find this communication either tedious or unprofitable.

Dear General: By the ""Marion"" and ""Creole"" I am in receipt of invoices and bills from Mr. Dexter, which will enable me without inconvenience to take up his draft for $60,000, about which I wrote you in my last. His letters, while they confirm my opinion of his good faith, also confirm me in my intention to cancel all authority to act for me in any way. He has taken risks for me to an amount and of a kind entirely unjustified by my authority or instructions, and the chances now are that I shall sustain a considerable loss by them. I shall be sustained by law and right in repudiating
his nets to a very large extent, but I shall carry them out so far as I can, partly out of a personal regard for him and partly on account of the strength of my recommendation to you and your brother.
I have recovered from my fears of any inconvenience even temporary from the weight of the business, though it taxes my resources very heavily, but I shall prefer that, while I am so largely in debt to you and Col. Butler, you should hold whatever property I have in New Orleans. I hope you will draw as lightly as possible until I have had time to turn Mr. Dexter's shipments into money. Of this Col. Butler will keep the run.
I now enclose your invoices and duplicate bills of mdse. per ""Emblem,"" consigned to you for sale on my account, the proceeds to be placed to my credit in account as a remittance. I should like this cargo closed out promptly if your market will permit without too much loss. I expect no profit, and only wish my business with New Orleans closed up, so that I can see where I stand. This of course does not apply to any business you or Col. Butler may send me, which I shall always gladly attend to. The ""Emblem"" invoices do not amount to quite so much as I had expected, but the amount will very nearly offset your present balance.
I have given you a letter to give to my friend, Mr. Brooks, whose house at Medford you will remember. He is one of my best friends, and a sterling fellow in every respect. His family has a large property in New Orleans, and he goes to ascertain its condition.
The Middlesex has made $200,000, and divides 10%. The Washington Mills make $200,000 on its woolen and $100,000 on its cotton business.
We are having news of great fighting at Fredericksburg. I trust we may win, but even if we do, it is, I fear, too late in the season to do anything on that line of operations.

Major General Butler, Comdg. U. S. Forces
Dear Sir: I should not have troubled you with this communication to-day had I not seen in the Washington correspondence of the World of this morning a recapitulation of the
charges alleged against you by your enemies, and said to have been submitted to the President. I enclose you the paper in question, or rather send it by mail.
Now, why a democratic newspaper like the World should pursue you with such vindictiveness as it does is hard to determine, except on the assumption that believing you to be an active supporter of the administration it prefers to strike at it through you. Heretofore the World was republican in its politics; but differing from the government on the subject of so-called ""arbitrary arrests,"" it finally went over to the democracy, and is now their recognized organ in this city. Its chief editor is a gentleman of high-standing, and one of the most efficient business men I know of; why he should allow the column of his Journal to be used against you is a question beyond my comprehension to solve, unless the above hypotheses be correct.
Your rigid performance of the duties appertaining to the station you hold has of course excited the utmost animosity of those who are secessionists per se, or sympathize with them to an extent hard to define, but none-the-less tangible on that account. That these two representatives of opposition to the administration should form an alliance to effect your removal cannot excite surprise. But that they should be joined in this attempt by others whose loyalty is unquestioned, appears strange. In these days, however, it is party ties that bring about such curious combinations.
I have not the slightest idea that you will be removed or interfered with at all; on the contrary, I believe that hereafter as heretofore your conduct will be approved of by the executive. Secure in his support, General, and of the approbation of the great body of our loyal citizens as well, go on in your career adding laurels to your wreath, and promoting the public welfare. Your reputation rests upon too firm a basis to be shaken by the breath of your enemies, who are impotent to wreak that vengeance they so long to inflict.
Gen. Burnside having affected a lodgement in the ruined city of Fredericksburg, finds out, to his surprise, the rebel army strongly entrenched, and prepared to dispute his advance on Richmond. Severe fighting has taken place without those decisive results so confidently looked for by the public. But he will triumph, or I am deceived in my estimation of his character. Our brave troops have had enough of repulses; henceforth they propose to celebrate victories. The papers of this morning will give you full particulars of the engagement.
I will inform you in confidence of an interesting fact, Gen. Cameron has, as you are probably aware, returned home from his Russian mission on leave of absence. Should Mr. Wilmot decline to be a candidate for re-election to the Senate, Mr. Cameron will be the administration nominee for that position, with every prospect of success notwithstanding the democracy have a small majority on joint ballot. From the fact of their candidate, Frank Hughes, being strongly tinctured with secession proclivities, judging from his effusions in the press and on the stump, Mr. Cameron will probably receive a sufficient support from the democratic members to insure his return. Whatever others may say, I firmly believe General Cameron to be one of the best and purest of our public men. A true patriot, he accepted the position of Secretary of War against his own inclination and at the urgent solicitations of the Executive. Finding the duties of the post too arduous for him, he resigned in February, 1862, at a time when our forces were victorious both on land and on sea. He was, as I believe, a warm friend of yourself, and appreciated your talents as they deserved. I sincerely hope he will be successful; for it is morally certain that if he is not, an opponent of the administration will succeed Mr. Wilmot.
The Delta is your recognized organ in New Orleans, and a better conducted Journal, considering its limited space, does not exist. I well remember its disunion tendencies before the commencement of the rebellion, and that for ten years previous to that time it divided with the Charleston Mercury the honor of extreme pestilential opinions in behalf of secession, the reopening of the slave trade, etc. A staunch Union Journal now, it supports with the greatest vigor the policy of the Government, although taking due care to avoid needlessly offending public sentiment in New Orleans with regard to the abolition of slavery there and in the adjoining parishes. The True Delta is also an excellent journal, true, I believe, to the Union and the Constitution, and, like the Richmond Whig, having yielded to secession only when resistance was impossible. The True Delta I think supported Douglas for President in 1860, the Delta, Breekinridge, and Picayune and Bee, John Bell. The Picayune, I am sorry to see, still clings under its present management to its former sympathy with traitors, although careful to observe what it is facetiously pleased to term ""neutrality."" Were George W. Kendall of Texas in control of its columns there would be no neutrality exhibited,
but in lieu thereof a warm espousal of the cause of the Union.
In my letters of Saturday I expressed belief that General Banks would not disembark his expeditionary force in the Virginia coast, but would doubtless proceed to some important Southern city, either Charleston, Savannah, or Mobile. It appears from the papers of to-day more than probable that I was mistaken in this assumption; and that the corps have been or will be landed at some point on the North Carolina coast, whence they can proceed first to cut off railroad communications between the South and Richmond, say at Weldon, and then march on the Confederate Capitol while Burnside's army is proceeding southward by the Fredericks-burg route. I earnestly hope that this belief be not ill-founded; as, if it is not we shall (Providence permitting) be in possession of Richmond by January 1st.
Your Sincere Friend, Charles S. Bartles"
"December 14, 1862","Washington D. C., December 14th, 1862
Major General Butler
My dear General: Your letter was handed by me personally to the President, and he read it all through in my presence, and, as he did so, acknowledged fully the capacity for service you have exhibited, and the past services you have actually performed. Beyond this he said nothing, except that he had written you some days since. He had promised this to me, and I was glad to learn that he had not forgotten to do so.
It was only since I received the letter to the President (with one to myself) that I learned from Mr. Stanton the real destination and instructions of Gen. Banks. I now understand that he is actually to take charge of the Department of the Gulf, to which Texas is annexed; and that he goes to New Orleans to direct operations on the river until it is opened, and on Texas, and I suppose on Mobile. I do not remember, however, that Mobile was mentioned. Of course, this commission supersedes yours. Before this conversation, I had supposed that General Banks was simply intrusted with the command of the expedition to Texas, and that though his command might lead to some conflict, if there were a disposition to make or have trouble, that your great work on the river
in Louisiana and Mississippi and at Mobile would not necessarily be interfered with. I need hardly say to you that I regret profoundly to find myself mistaken. My respect for General Banks and confidence in his ability is entirely sincere; but I must frankly say to you (and I really hope you will not take what I say as a mere compliment but as what it is -- my honest conviction) that in my judgment you have done more work and more important work and have done it better than any General whom the President has commissioned; and I believe this is the judgment of the country. Of course, I cannot think it for the good of the country that you should be superseded even by General Banks. We have not a great many men of first-rate ability, and I think there is work for them all, and room enough to do it in, without bringing one over another in this fashion.
And this brings me to what I want most particularly to say. You intimate a purpose of resigning. I most earnestly hope you will dismiss this thought. It is no discredit to serve under a prior officer. General Banks is your friend and you are his. Each can greatly help the other, and there is room enough in the honor and gratitude of the country for both. It would grieve many if you should retire, and the country, I am sure, would suffer immensely. Don't think that the appointment of General Banks will really harm you. It will not. Your retirement would, for it would be ascribed to wounded self-love. If you remain, doing your duty as here tofore, everyone will feel that you are governed by a generous patriotism, and your present enviable position will be enhanced.
I wish I could repeat to you all I have said. Our friends in Congress are unanimous in your praise. Nobody finds fault except some honest people who really believe what has been said about your connection with trade, and some designing people who circulate their stories probably without much regard to their truth or falsehood.
The election of Mr. Flanders gratifies me much. I know nothing of Mr. Hahn. I hope he is as good a man. I should like to have a talk with you about our political future. There must be a new organization of parties. The party which now opposes the National Government is not in any just sense the Democratic party, and ought not to be so called. It is simply the opposition, in which old Whigs, Know-nothings, and Democrats unite to expel the Republican from power. A new
party, really Democratic and really Republican, must arise, of which you ought to be an honored and able leader.
But at present let us give all our thoughts to the salvation of our country. A very considerable battle was fought yesterday. Today, Sunday, there is a sort of truce. Tomorrow we expect decisive work. May God give us the victory.

General Orders No. 106
Soldiers of the Army of the Gulf
Relieved from further duties in this Department by direction of the President, under the date of November 9, 1862, I take leave of you by this final order, it being impossible to visit your scattered out-posts, covering hundreds of miles of the frontier of a larger territory than some of the kingdoms of Europe.
I greet you, my brave comrades, and say farewell!
This word, endeared as you are by a community of privations, hardships, dangers, victories, successes, military and civil, is the only sorrowful thought I have.
You have deserved well of your country. Without a murmur you sustained an encampment on a sand-bar, so desolate that banishment to it, with every care and comfort possible, has been the most dreaded punishment inflicted upon your bitterest and most insulting enemies.
You had so little transportation that but a handful could advance to compel submission by the Queen City of the Rebellion, whilst others waded breast-deep in the marshes which surround St. Philip, and forced the surrender of a fort, deemed impregnable to land attack by the most skilful engineers of your country and her enemy.
At your occupation, order, law, quiet and peace sprang to this city, filled with the bravos of all nations, where for a score of years, during the profoundest peace, human life was scarcely safe at noonday.
By your discipline you illustrated the best traits of the American soldier, and enchained the admiration of those that come to scoff.
Landing with a military chest containing but seventy-five dollars, from the hoards of a rebel government you have given to your country's treasury nearly a half million of dollars, and so supplied yourselves with the needs of your service that your expedition has cost your Government less by four-fifths than any other.
You have fed the starving poor, the wives and children of your enemies, so converting enemies into friends that they have sent their representatives to your Congress by a vote greater than your entire numbers, from districts in which, when you entered, you were tauntingly told that there was ""no one to raise your flag.""
By your practical philanthropy you have won the confidence of the ""oppressed race"" and the slave. Hailing you as deliverers, they are ready to aid you as willing servants, faithful laborers, or, using the tactics taught them by your enemies, to fight with you in the field.
By steady attention to the laws of health, you have stayed the pestilence, and, humble instruments in the hands of God, you have demonstrated the necessity that His creatures should obey His laws, and, reaping His blessing in the most unhealthy climate, you have preserved your ranks fuller than those of any other Battalions of the same length of service.
You have met double numbers of the enemy, and defeated him in the open field; but I need no further enlarge upon this topic. You were sent here to do that.
I commend you to your Commander. You are worthy of his love.
Farewell, my comrades! again farewell!

"December 26, 1862","New York, Friday Dec. 26th, 1862
Maj. General Butler, New Orleans, La.
Dear Sir: Christmas day passed off pleasantly here as I trust it did everywhere.
Before you receive this communication you will of course have been informed of the recent Cabinet fiasco. It appears that a majority of the Republican Senators, headed by Mr. Sunmer, believing that the time had arrived when the President should have a united Cabinet, called a caucus, and decided to send a committee to wait upon the President and ask for a reconstruction of the Cabinet. This was done. When Secretary Seward heard of the action of the caucus, he promptly tendered his resignation. Mr. Chase, desirous of convincing Mr. Seward, with whom he had always been on the most friendly terms, that he had no part in the movement, and that he disapproved of it, also resigned. The President after due consideration declined to accept either resignation.
This decision ought to convince the most skeptical that hereafter we shall have a united Cabinet.
A rumor was lately in circulation that you were to be relieved of your command by Gen. Banks, he having [been] appointed your successor. I have no confidence in this story. It may be true that Gen. Banks has gone to New Orleans, and that his forces will rendezvous at Ship Island, for the purpose of coöperating with your own command in the capture of Mobile, now believed to be imminent.
The report of Hon. Reverdy Johnson on the result of his mission to New Orleans has been submitted to the Senate, but has not yet, I believe, been published. When it is I will try and forward you a copy.
Gen. Burnside's army, which now ought to number 150,000 men, is still encamped on the hills of Stafford County, Va. It is not possible he will again move on Richmond before January 1st.
From an estimate just made it appears that upward of $12,000 will be collected as internal revenue in this city during the present fiscal year.
Attorney General Bates recently decided that the negroes are citizens. I enclose a copy of his opinion, which, if sustained by the Supreme Court of the United States, completely
reverses the Dred Scott decision. Business in the city is quite dull.

"December 24, 1862","New Orleans, Dec. 24, 1862
Citizens of New Orleans
It may not be inappropriate, as it is not inopportune in occasion, that there should be addressed to you a few words at parting, by one whose name is to be hereafter indissolubly connected with your city.
I shall speak in no bitterness, because I am not conscious of a single personal animosity. Commanding the Army of the Gulf, I found you captured, but not surrendered; conquered, but not orderly; relieved from the presence of an army, but incapable of taking care of yourselves. I restored order, punished crime, opened commerce, brought provisions to your starving people, reformed your currency, and gave you quiet protection, such as you had not enjoyed for many years. While doing this, my soldiers were subjected to obloquy, reproach, and insult.
And now, speaking to you who know the truth; I here declare that whoever has quietly remained about his business, affording neither aid nor comfort to the enemies of the United States, has never been interfered with by the soldiers of the United States.
The men who had assumed to govern you and to defend your city in arms having fled, some of your women flouted at the presence of those who came to protect them. By a simple order (No. 28), I called upon every soldier of this army to treat the women of New Orleans as gentlemen should deal with the sex, with such effect that I now call upon the just-minded ladies of New Orleans to say whether they have ever enjoyed so complete protection and calm quiet for themselves and their families as since the advent of the United States troops.
The enemies of my country, unrepentant and implacable, I have treated with merited severity. I hold that rebellion is treason, and that treason, persisted in, is death, and any punishment short of that due a traitor gives so much clear gain to him from the elemency of the government. Upon this thesis have I administered the authority of the United States, because of which I am not unconscious of complaint. I do not feel that I have erred in too much harshness, for that harshness has ever been exhibited to disloyal enemies to my country, and not to loyal friends. To be sure, I might have regaled you with the amenities of British civilization, and yet
been within the supposed rules of civilized warfare. You might have been smoked to death in caverns, as were the Covenanters of Scotland by the command of a general of the royal house of England; or roasted, like the inhabitants of Algiers during the French campaign; your wives and daughters might have been given over to the ravisher, as were the unfortunate dames of Spain in the Peninsular War; or you might have been scalped and tomahawked, as our mothers were at Wyoming by the savage allies of Great Britain in our own Revolution; your property could have been turned over to indiscriminate ""loot,"" like the palace of the Emperor of China; works of art which adorned your buildings might have been sent away, like paintings of the Vatican; your sons might have been blown from the mouths of cannon, like the Sepoys at Delhi; and yet all this would have been within the rules of civilized warfare as practised by the most polished and the most hypocritical nations of Europe. For such acts the records of the doings of some of the inhabitants of your city toward the friends of the Union, before my coming, were a sufficient provocative and justification.
But I have not so conducted. On the contrary, the worst punishment inflicted, except for criminal acts punishable by every law, has been banishment with labor to a barren island, where I encamped my own soldiers before marching here.
It is true, I have levied upon the wealthy rebels and paid out nearly half a million of dollars to feed forty thousand of the starving poor of all nations assembled here, made so by this war.
I saw that this Rebellion was a war of the aristocrats against the middling men, of the rich against the poor, a war of the land-owner against the laborer; that it was a struggle for the retention of power in the hands of the few against the many; and I found no conclusion to it, save in the subjugation of the few and the disenthrallment of the many. I therefore felt no hesitation in taking the substance of the wealthy, who had caused the war, to feed the innocent poor, who had suffered by the war. And I shall now leave you with the proud consciousness that I carry with me the blessings of the humble and loyal, under the roof of the cottage and in the cabin of the slave, and so am quite content to incur the sneers of the salon, or the curses of the rich.
I have found you trembling at the terrors of servile insurrection. All danger of this I have prevented by so treating the slave that he had no cause to rebel.
I found the dungeon, the chain, and the lash your only means of enforcing obedience in your servants. I leave them peaceful, laborious, controlled by the laws of kindness and justice.
I have demonstrated that the pestilence can be kept from your borders.
I have added a million of dollars to your wealth in the form of new land from the batture of the Mississippi.
I have cleansed and improved your streets, canals, and public squares, and opened new avenues to unoccupied land.
I have given you freedom of elections greater than you have ever enjoyed before.
I have caused justice to be administered so impartially that your own advocates have unanimously complimented the judges of my appointment.
You have seen, therefore, the benefit of the laws and justice of the government against which you have rebelled.
Why, then, will you not all return to your allegiance to that government, -- not with lip-service, but with the heart?
I conjure you, if you desire ever to see renewed prosperity, giving business to your streets and wharves -- if you hope to see your city become again the mart of the western world, fed by its rivers for more than three thousand miles, draining the commerce of a country greater than the mind of man hath ever conceived -- return to your allegiance.
If you desire to leave to your children the inheritance you received from your fathers -- a stable constitutional government; if you desire that they should be in the future a portion of the greatest empire the sun ever shone upon -- return to your allegiance.
There is but one thing that stands in the way.
There is but one thing that at this hour stands between you and your government -- and that is slavery.
The institution, cursed of God, which has taken its last refuge here, in His providence will be rooted out as the tares from the wheat, although the wheat be torn up with it.
I have given much thought to this subject.
I came among you, by teachings, by habit of mind, by political position, by social affinity, inclined to sustain your domestic laws, if by possibility they might be with safety to the Union.
Months of experience and of observation have forced the conviction that the existence of slavery is incompatible with
the safety either of yourselves or of the Union. As the system has gradually grown to its present huge dimensions, it were best if it could be gradually removed; but it is better, far better, that it should be taken out at once, than that it should longer vitiate the social, political, and family relations of your country. I am speaking with no philanthropic views as regards the slave, but simply of the effect of slavery on the master. See for yourselves. Look around you and say whether this saddening, deadening influence has not all but destroyed the very framework of your society?
I am speaking the farewell words of one who has shown his devotion to his country at the peril of his life and fortune, who in these words can have neither hope nor interest, save the good of those whom he addresses; and let me here repeat, with all the solemnity of an appeal to heaven to bear me witness, that such are the views forced upon me by experience.
Come, then, to the unconditional support of the government. Take into your own hands your own institutions; remodel them according to the laws of nations and of God, and thus attain that great prosperity assured to you by geographical position, only a portion of which was heretofore yours.

A Proclamation by the President of the Confederate States
""Whereas, a communication was addressed on the 6th day of July last, 1862, by General Robert E. Lee, acting under the instructions of the secretary of war of the Confederate States of America, to General H. W. Halleck, commander-in-chief of the United States Army, informing the latter that a report had reached this government that Wm. B. Mumford, a citizen of the Confederate States, had been executed by the United States authorities at New Orleans for having pulled down the United States flag in that city before its occupation by the United States forces, and calling for a statement of the facts, with a view of retaliation if such an outrage had really been committed under the sanction of the authorities of the United States;
And whereas (no answer having been received to said letter), another letter was, on the 2nd of August last, 1862, addressed by General Lee, under my instructions, to General
Halleck, renewing the inquiries in relation to the execution of the said Mumford, with the information that, in the event of not receiving a reply within fifteen days, it would be assumed that the fact was true, and was sanctioned by the government of the United States;
And whereas, an answer, dated on the 7th of August last, 1862, was addressed to General Lee by General H. W. Halleck, the said general-in-chief of the armies of the United States, alleging sufficient cause for failure to make early reply to said letter of the 6th of July, asserting that ‘no authentic information had been received in relation to the execution of Mumford; but measures will be immediately taken to ascertain the facts of the alleged execution,’ and promising that General Lee should be duly informed thereof;
And whereas, on the 26th of November last, 1862, another letter was addressed, under my instructions, by Robert Ould, Confederate agent for the exchange of prisoners, under the eartel between the two governments, to Lieutenant-Colonel W. H. Ludlow, agent of the United States under said cartel, informing him that the explanation promised in the said letter of General Halleck, of 7th of August last, had not yet been received, and that if no answer was sent to the government within fifteen days from the delivery of this last communication, it would be considered that an answer is declined;
And whereas, by a letter dated on the 3rd day of the present month of December, the said Lieutenant-Colonel Ludlow apprised the said Robert Ould that the above recited communication of the 19th of November had been received and forwarded to the secretary of war of the United States; and whereas, this last delay of fifteen days allowed for answer has elapsed, and no answer has been received;
And whereas, in addition to the tacit admission resulting from the above refusal to answer, I have received evidence fully establishing the truth of the fact that the said William B. Mumford, a citizen of the Confederacy, was actually and publicly executed, in cold blood, by hanging, after the occupation of the city of New Orleans by the forces under General Benjamin F. Butler, when said Mumford was an unresisting and non-combatant captive, and for no offense even alleged to have been committed by him subsequent to the date of the capture of the said city;
And whereas, the silence of the government of the United States, and its maintaining of said Butler in high office under
its authority for many months after his commission of an act that can be viewed in no other light than as a deliberate murder, as well as of numerous other outrages and atrocities hereafter to be mentioned, afford evidence too conclusive that the said government sanctions the conduct of the said Butler, and is determined that he shall remain unpunished for these crimes;
Now, therefore, I, Jefferson Davis, President of the Confederate States of America, and in their name, do pronounce and declare the said Benjamin F. Butler to be a felon, deserving of capital punishment. I do order that he shall no longer be considered or treated simply as a public enemy of the Confederate States of America, but as an outlaw and common enemy of mankind, and that, in the event of his capture, the officer in command of the capturing force do cause him to be immediately executed by hanging.
And I do farther order that no commissioned officer of the United States, taken captive, shall be released on parole, before exchanged, until the said Butler shall have met with due punishment for his crimes.
And whereas, the hostilities waged against this Confederacy by the forces of the United States, under the command of said Benjamin F. Butler, have borne no resemblance to such warfare as is alone permissible by the rules of international law or the usages of civilization, but have been characterized by repeated atrocities and outrages, among the large number of which the following may be cited as examples:
Peaceful and aged citizens, unresisting captives and non-combatants, have been confined at hard labor, with iron chains attached to their limbs, and are still so held, in dungeons and fortresses.
Others have been submitted to a like degrading punishment for selling medicines to the sick soldiers of the Confederacy.
The soldiers of the United States have been invited and encouraged in general orders to insult and outrage the wives, the mothers, and the sisters of our citizens.
Helpless women have been torn from their homes, and subjected to solitary confinement, some in fortresses and prisons, and one especially on an island of barren sand, under a tropical sun; have been fed with loathsome rations that have been condemned as unfit for soldiers, and have been exposed to the vilest insults.
Prisoners of war, who surrendered to the naval forces of
the United States, on agreement that they should be released on parole, have been seized and kept in close confinement.
Repeated pretexts have been sought or invented for plundering the inhabitants of a captured city, by fines levied and collected under threats of imprisoning recusants at hard labor with ball and chain. The entire population of New Orleans have been forced to elect between starvation by the confiscation of all property and taking an oath against conscience to bear allegiance to the invader of their country.
Egress from the city has been refused to those whose fortitude withstood the test, and even to lone and aged women, and to helpless children; and, after being ejected from their homes and robbed of their property, they have been left to starve in the streets or subsist on charity.
The slaves have been driven from the plantations in the neighborhood of New Orleans until their owners would consent to share their crops with the commanding general, his brother, Andrew J. Butler, and other officers; and when such consent had been extorted, the slaves have been restored to the plantations, and there compelled to work under the bayonets of the guards of United States soldiers. Where that partnership was refused, armed expeditions have been sent to the plantations to rob them of everything that was susceptible of removal.
And even slaves, too aged or infirm to work, have, in spite of their entreaties, been forced from the homes provided by their owners, and driven to wander helpless on the highway.
By a recent General Order No. 91, the entire property in that part of Louisiana west of the Mississippi river has been sequestrated for confiscation, and officers have been assigned to duty, with orders to gather up and collect the personal property, and turn over to the proper officers, upon their receipts, such of said property as may be required for the use of the United States army; to collect together all the personal property and bring the same to New Orleans, and cause it to be sold at public auction to highest bidders -- an order which, if executed, condemns to punishment, by starvation, at least a quarter of a million of human beings, of all ages, sexes, and conditions, and of which the execution, although forbidden to military officers by the orders of President Lincoln, is in accordance with the confiscation law of our enemies, which he has effected to be enforced through the agency of civil officials.
And, finally, the African slaves have not only been incited
to insurection by every license and encouragement, but numbers of them have actually been armed for a servile war -- a war in its nature far exceeding the horrors and most merciless atrocities of savages.
And whereas, the officers under command of the said Butler have been, in many instances, active and zealous agents in the commission of these crimes, and no instance is known of the refusal of any one of them to participate in the outrages above narrated;
And whereas, the president of the United States has, by public and official declarations, signified not only his approval of the effort to excite servile war within the Confederacy, but his intention to give aid and encouragement thereto, if these independent states shall continue to refuse submission to a foreign power after the 1st day of January next, and has thus made known that all appeal to the law of nations, the dictates of reason, and the instincts of humanity would be addressed in vain to our enemies, and that they can be deterred from the commission of these crimes only by the terrors of just retributions;
Now, therefore, I, Jefferson Davis, president of the Confederate States of America, and acting by their authority, appealing to the Divine Judge in attestation that their conduct is not guided by the passion of revenge, but that they reluctantly yield to the solemn duty of redressing, by necessary severity, crimes of which their citizens are the victims, do issue this my proclamation, and, by virtue of my authority as commander-in-chief of the armies of the Confederate States, do order --
First -- That all commissioned officers in the command of said Benjamin F. Butler be declared not entitled to be considered as soldiers engaged in honorable warfare, but as robbers and criminals, deserving death; and each of them be, whenever captured, reserved for execution.
Second -- That the private soldiers and non-commissioned officers in the army of said Butler be considered as only the instruments used for the commission of crimes perpetrated by his orders, and not as free agents; that they, therefore, be treated when captured as prisoners of war, with kindness and humanity, and be sent home on the usual parole that they will in no manner aid or serve the United States in any capacity during the continuance of this war, unless duly exchanged.
Third -- That all negro slaves captured in arms be at once
delivered over to the executive authorities of the respective states to which they belong, to be dealt with according to the law of said states.
Fourth -- That the like orders be issued in all cases with respect to the commissioned officers of the United States when found serving in company with said slaves in insurrection against the authorities of the different states of this Confederacy.
In testimony whereof, I have signed these presents, and caused the seal of the Confederate States of America to be affixed thereto, at the city of Richmond, on the 23d day of December, in the year of our Lord one thousand eight hundred and sixty-two.

Sprague's organ, if not his property in whole or in part. It has, of late, discovered more than heretofore a proclivity to politics of the Valendingham and Judge B. T. Thomas type. But it is rumored that Gov. Sprague is inclining to the policy of the national administration. How the Press and the Governor will come out hereafter remains to be seen.
I am sure that the strictures of the Press on your administration will pass by you as the idle wind, and that you will treat the fulmination of the bogus rebel President as Martin Luther did the Pope's bull of excommunication. That you will be intimidated by the malignant sentence of outlawing, those who know you do not believe. Doubtless the proclamation is chiefly designed to anticipate the forthcoming one of President Lincoln, and to counteract its influence. You are singled out for special vengeance because of your superior vigilance, boldness, and efficiency in curbing the insolence and suppressing the machinations of the rebels.
Quos Deus vult perdere, etc. is true of these rebels. Infatuated they are, and when the ""peculiar institution"" shall be overthrown, as it will be, it will be patent to the world that the initiation of the event will be credited to them. But I tax your attention too much by expatiating on matters better understood by you.
Perhaps the only thing I can mention worth your notice is the fact that in the small circle of my intercourse, you are winning golden opinions from all sorts of people, excepting only a few political bigots I am, Dear Sir,
Very truly yours, William Tyler"
"January 2, 1863","New Orleans, Jan. 2nd, 1863
General Butler
My Dear Sir: The day I sailed from New York I was authoritatively informed that you had been superseded; I was therefore prepared to find you deprived of your command. I was disappointed, however, in not finding you here, as I hoped to have seen you before your departure.
Very shortly after reaching Washington I became convinced that the authorities were working, or had already worked, against you, although they professed to be your friends. The day I arrived it was impossible for me to see the Secretary of State; I however saw the Secretary of War, and explained to him what your despatches to the State Department were. He
promised to have them delivered immediately. They were not received for several days, and had not been read the day after the Secretary got them. When I expressed my surprise to Mr. Seward at this, he said it made no difference, as he had had no time to read them, even if they had been received. The Secretary of the Treasury positively refused to grant me the permission which you had sanctioned, and not only that, even returned a letter to me, written by the collector at N. Y., with the seal unbroken. All these things forced upon me the suspicion that a new government had been determined upon for this section, not withstanding their protestations of friendship, and the facts that the Secretary of War had reported most favorably of your conduct here, and the President was then recommending to Congress that you should be presented with a sword. In my opinion several things conspired against you.
1. The Secretary of War knew that there was a clamor against him, and a large share of public attention was directed towards Gen. Banks as his successor. He was therefore not opposed to have him out of the way.
2. Seward was always opposed to you, and he was constantly in a state of alarm lest you should bring about what he termed some complications with European Powers. You out of the way, and he considered such a contigency as a very remote one. He was therefore in favor of your removal.
In the third place, you will have discovered that so far this war has been nothing but a political campaign: the question with the present incumbents being how they can best keep where they are; and with the opposition, which General can fight himself into the Presidency.
Now, the people in the North and West are divided into two classes: those who are your friends and those who are opposed to you and a very large party there are already in your favor for that position. The Government, then, was all in fear of you, and thus determined upon breaking you down if they could, just as they attempted to do it when they sent you here.
I make these suggestions to you thinking that they may possibly throw some light upon what would seem their inexplicable conduct. But, General, this is not the object of my troubling you with this already long letter. Your own penetration will no doubt have discovered to you long ago the reasons for your treatment you have received.
My purpose in addressing you now is to attempt to express
to you the gratitude I feel for the very many services which you rendered me while you were in this city. You were truly and disinterestedly my friend, and, come what come may, I can never fail to think of you with anything but the strongest feelings.
The machinations of designing men may seemingly have triumphed over you for the present, and it pains me to think that you are in some trouble. The pretended belief in slanders on the part of the Government may make some action on your part necessary, and I had thought that it might be possible that I might have an opportunity to serve you. If so, I claim it as a right that you call upon me. You would not, I know, ask anything of any man which is not bounded by the largest horizon of honor; anywhere within that circle, in any manner, or at any risk, you can command, and, believe me, confide in me.
Again thanking you for all you have done and have tried to do for my advantage, I remain,
Yours Most Truly, P. H. Morgan"

My dear General: I wish I could see you and thank you for your services at New Orleans, where you have done so nobly and well. But as distance separates us, I want you to see my friend, Rev. Jaines Freeman Clarke, of West Roxbury, who takes a great interest in public affairs, and who exerts a wide moral and political influence in this community. You ought to know him, and on your account as well as on his, I
have handed him this note, and you can talk freely with him of your position and labors.
I would like now to publish your private letter to me on Aug. (15) 1861 -- in relation to slavery and the necessity of destroying it. It shows you as foreseeing and anticipating events. A personal allusion to an officer of a Mass. regiment would of course be suppressed. You speak of Cameron's answer to your letter as ""evasive, unsatisfactory, and inconclusive."" This might be omitted if you desired, though I see no impropriety in retaining it. What do you say?
Be not afraid of the calumniators. God never deserts, the American people never desert, a man determined to do his duty. At this hour no General in the army has so much the respect of the people as yourself, and your administration of New Orleans has now the admiration of all who are in earnest in suppressing the rebellion.

Dear General: Mr. Stanton assured me last evening that had he known your real position with regard to the Proclamation, he would have cut off his right hand before
he would have allowed anybody to take your place. That his fixed purpose was that on the 1st. Jan. a General should be in command at New Orleans to whom the Proclamation would be a living letter, and that in this respect it was natural after the recent elections in Pa. and N. Y., that he should look to a Republican rather than to an old Democrat.
I mention these things frankly, that you may see the precise motive of the recent change.
I afterwards saw the President, who said that he hoped very soon to return you to New Orleans. He added that he was anxious to keep you in the public service to gratify you, as you had deserved well of the country.

"January 9, 1863","New Orleans, January 9th, 1863
My dear friend, Capt. George: As there is a mail going from here for New York to-morrow, I will try and give you some idea of New Orleans as I see it now. I was somewhat prepared to find the change in this Department of the Gulf, remembering what you told me in New York, and then passing some of Banks' expedition near Key West, I began to think that General Banks was to relieve General Butler, which we found was true when we arrived at the Passes. We arrived in the city the 24th of Dec. about 9 o'clock in the evening. The next day, being Christmas, was a holiday, and of course a good deal of liquor drank, which, with General Banks' flattering proclamations and mild treatment with them here, brought out their true feelings into words, and in many places quite loud. The health of Jeff Davis was drank often by crowds in bar-rooms so as to be heard in the streets by those passing.
I found, what I always told you was true, that there was no Union feeling in New Orleans. They dared do nothing but obey when General Butler was here, but, now he is gone, they curse him, and tell all sorts of stories about him, and speak in high terms of Banks. I saw, the day after I came here, in a window in Camp Street, the portrait of Beauregard with forty tickets at 50 cents each for sale, and when all sold to be raffled for The portrait never would have been exhibited, neither the health of Jeff Davis drank, had Gen. Butler been in command here. I dont think Banks is ""big"" enough for the place.
I have been out to the Texas line to bring sugar, but it has all been bought up. I saw the Confederate soldiers across the Rio. We have about fifteen hundred men stationed there with three gun boats, and it is said they have three thousand men and three or four boats, such as they are, a short distance up the Rio. I think Banks had better look out or they will recapture the Opelousas R. R., and all the territory south and west of the Miss. that Gen. Butler captured.
Trade is very dull here, as Gen. Banks will not give any one permit to trade out of the city. 'Tis well that we did not get a permit to go to Galveston, as we tried, for had we got it I should be there with the ""Franklin."" The ""Franklin"" arrived here on the first of January, just commenced discharging her with the crew as there is no hurry. Freights
are very low, they have got nothing yet to freight the ""Franklin"" home. Read feels very blue; Fisher says he should feel well enough if he had you here. The ""Saxon"" started last night for New York. I wanted to go in her, but Fisher said I must stay till the ""Relief"" came; he might want me. We have not heard a word from the ""Relief"" yet, save by the paper that she was to leave New York the 25th Dec. The transports are all leaving for N. York. The ""Quincy"" is repairing her furnace or something about the boiler, and will be ready to leave the first of the week. I am stopping on the ""Franklin,"" live better than at any hotel in this city. I presume I shall go home in the ""Franklin,"" she beats most all the clippers, coming out here in seventeen days. I am anxious to hear from home. We have had no mail for nearly two weeks.

Sir: I beg your acceptance of the accompanying volume with the assurance of my respect. It is a book to which in October last I added some notes, in one of which (on page 107) I expressed, briefly and imperfectly, an appreciation of your rule and your writing in New Orleans, which since then has only been confirmed and heightened. Indeed, though neither a military man nor a politician, I venture to say, after narrowly watching the course of events, during the last year and a half, that you, Sir, have exhibited during the whole of that time those qualities the lack of which in others has brought us to the present pass in our national affairs.
Trusting that the order which relieved you of your arduous duties at New Orleans will prove to have been justified by the necessity of assigning you to a wider, though it can be hardly a more important field of labor, I am, Sir,
Very respectfully, Your obdt. Servant,

"January 13, 1863","Private. New Orleans, La., Jan. 13th, 1863
Hon. M. Blair, P. M. Gen'l. of the U. S., Washington
Dear Sir: As I believe that you sincerely desire to crush the rebellion by military force and not to palter with treason by compromises, I again trouble you with a line. Can't Texas be taken out of Gen. Banks' military department? If so, I do most earnestly urge you to use your influence to accomplish that end. Since he came here I have not called upon him (and have been but very little about Gen. Hamilton; my contempt for their contented inefficiency was too great to permit me to waste my personal attentions upon them), but from what has come before the public I have seen that he is wholly unequal to his position. With but small administrative intent, and without military capacity or even confidence in his own views and energy to carry them out, he has done nothing and can and will do nothing -- he is a complete failure. Even his sycophants will have to acknowledge that the well-known quotation, ""Signus imperio nisi imperasset,"" would form a motto peculiarly appropriate to his case. Thus far his administration has served no purpose save to afford a foil to Butler's.
For Heaven's sake don't let Banks go to Texas! He won't suit the job. He has not sense and does not possses the pluck to do any good there, and is surrounded by a staff that would paralyze the genius of the 1st Napoleon. Give this some earnest and energetic man that does not in the meantime appear too plainly to be the compromise of Seward candidate for the presidency of the United States, and let him commence his attack on or near the Rio Grande, and success will certainly cover his efforts.
It appears that inasmuch as five railroads converge to Houston, and a trunk road goes from thence to Galveston making Galveston the only point on the entire coast of Texas out of which all the rebel forces within 150 miles could be massed within a few hours, it was selected by Admiral Farragut as a point to be taken and by Gen. Banks as a point to be occupied. The result is already before you. Now, if Napoleon 1st were at the head of our Government, he would disgrace Farragut for taking a place without military value to us, and for attacking at a point where our enemies wish us to attempt to make an entrance into the state, and leaving the
railroad bridge from the mainland to the island unbroken; and he would at least have removed Banks for suffering a small force to be landed where so long as the bridge stood they would be entirely at the mercy of the enemy. These officers, through neglect or ignorance of facts they could have easily have mustered, have caused defeat and loss. I suppose that some petty naval officer will be made the scape-goat, and that Farragut and Banks will escape even an inquiry.
I know something about Texas, having spent some 16 years of my life there, and I now assure you that if any move be made to recover that State by way of Red River, or the Sahine, or Galveston, it will cause a wanton and useless sacrifice of treasure and of blood. Indianola is the point at which an adequate force ought to enter. A smaller force could maintain itself and do much good if landed at Point Isabel.
In the meantime, my loyal friends in Texas were sacrificed by useless delay on the part of the Government. Can't a few men, provided with arms and ammunition and authority to recruit be sent to Point Isabel, and protected by a light-draft gunboat? If so, thousands can be saved. The rebel trade with and through Mexico would be broken up, and you little dream how important it has become.
Gen. Banks contemplates sending a steamer there to bring off the Union men to this place. I can scarce conceive of greater folly. Such action would cause our Government to be looked upon in Mexico as the most cowardly and inefficient on earth.
I forgot to say that Fort Brown has long since been evacuated by the Rebels, and the heavy guns removed to Ringgold Barracks.

My dear Sir: Miracles are occurring in our time, if never before. I have just come from Tremont Temple where, to an immense audience, Wendell Phillips has delivered an eulogy (to appropriate a phrase applicable to dead men) on yourself, and his commendations were not because of your views on slavery, but by reason of the fact that you have done something and know how to do more. He spoke of you as the only man who ""had organized victory."" He rebuked the government for recalling you and filling your place by a man who could organize nothing more formidable than a caucus. And he went on, at great length, in a strain of highly eulogistic remarks. The audience received what he said with enthusiastic applause, Sunday night ""to the contrary notwithstanding.""
Phillips, in these winter months, manufactures a vast amount of popular opinion. No man will speak oftener or to larger audiences in America for the next few months. He is really a stateman though not recognized as such ""by the general."" A mention of this fact I make, because I think now the only hope of America rests in keeping up a healthy state of sentiment both as to measures and men in the great masses. These masses in New England and New York and Ohio are reached by men like Phillips who have the public ear in Lyceum Halls.

My dear Sir: I am arraigned before Gen. C. Grover, Brig. Gen. Comdg. at this Post, and prohibited from trading here, having been tried, condemned, and sentenced without a hearing, for a paper which one Zeigler signed here last summer agreeing not to purchase cotton above the maximum price fixed for me to purchase to stock the Penitentiary. Having been advised by Col. McMillan that this affidavit of Zeigler had been acted upon by a board of enquiry, who had decided that I was simply discharging my duty as an officer, I had
contented myself in regard to the matter, but now I find -- and this is not the first instance I have had of the same spirit -- that I am to be pursued by Gen. Banks' subordinates until I am driven from the Department.
The circumstances connected with this subject are briefly these: When the factory of the Penitentiary was stopped for want of cotton, and the prisoners were being fed from the Commissary Department, this Ziegler shipped a quantity of cotton to New Orleans in violation of your order to first offer it to the Penitentiary. This cotton was by your order returned to this city, where I was waited upon by Lt. S. W. Peree, A. Q. M. of the Post, in company with Zeigler, and I was urged by this officer to allow the cotton to be returned, Zeigler at the same time expressing a determination not to buy any more cotton at this place, and asking the privilege of expressing that determination in writing, -- his previous relations with my clerk having convinced me that his word was not to be taken, a fact which he very well knew. Having procured several weeks' supply between the shipment and the return of Zeigler's cotton, I complied with the Quartermaster's request, and released this cotton, at the same time complying with Zeigler's request to allow him to sign the paper for which I am now outlawed by Gen. Grover.
The transaction had no other object than a compliance with the necessity for providing the Penitentiary with stock to keep the prisoners employed profitably, and was in harmony with your order and those of Gen. Williams, the paper itself having been written at the request of the Quartermaster in charge, and since at no time during my charge of the Penitentiary factory did I buy or sell a bale of cotton except for the Government, of which I have rendered a just and full account to the military Governor of the State, in compliance with your commands, I have no alternative but through you, to demand of the war department not only full restitution for being deprived of my rights as a citizen of the United States, but a reasonable compensation for the loss to which I am subjected by the Military authorities here, -- upon the unsupported affidavit of an individual who left this State as it is believed to avoid being convicted of felony.

This amount, together with much more, was collected from property of loyal citizens confiscated by the rebels and deposited to their credit in gross. Many drafts were drawn against this fund, and the balance only was got by me.
There are very many claims upon this fund by loyal citizens whose property was thus taken. It is not sufficient to pay all. It cannot be shown that any given citizen's property is in it, as his amount may have been drawn out by the receivers and his neighbor's left behind.
Therefore I have suggested that a commission be established to adjudicate on all their claims, and divide the amount pro rata amongst the just claimants.
But this is for the wisdom of the Government. I know of nothing further upon the topic that would be for the advantage of your office to communicate. I have the honor to be,
Very Respect. Your obedient Servant,
Benj. F. Butler, Maj. Gen. U. S. V."

Sir: I think General Butler should go to New Orleans again. He is unwilling to go unless he is restored to the command of the department. He should start by the 1st of February, and should take some force with him. The whole must be so managed as to not wrong or wound the feelings of General Banks. His original wish was to go to Texas, and it must be arranged for him to do this now with a substantial force; and yet he must not go to the endangering the opening of the Mississippi. I hope this may be done by the time General Butler shall arrive there; but whether or not, I think we cannot longer dispense with General Butler's services.

He proposes either to write or see you; and, as the frankness of a personal explanation is most likely to produce a clear and good understanding, I think well of the idea of his making you a visit.

Sir: This Committee have had under consideration your letter to the Citizens of New Orleans of Dec. 24th, 1862, and
they request me to do an impossibility in reference thereto, which is to convey to you their high sense of admiration and satisfaction at the value of your words, and at your clear and convincing statement.
Before and since the rebellion, the Committee lost no proper opportunity of raising their humble voice in support of the United States, and against the rebellion and its objects and real promoters.
When Lord Russell granted belligerent rights to the rebels, the Committee sent him a protest against the act as being unlawful and unprecedented; when he declared that the blockading of the Southern ports was ""unjustifiable,"" the Committee exposed his hypocrisy by comparing the conduct of England in suppressing the Indian insurrection -- a lawful one -- with that of the United States, and asked him if it would be justifiable in them to blow the rebels from guns instead of stopping their supplies, which he said was unjustifiable. When the affair of the Trent happened, the Committee petitioned the Queen praying that her officers who had violated her proclamation might be punished according to law. These are but a few of the acts of the Committee in the same direction, and they have had the satisfaction of seeing in some degree the fruit of their labours. All the newspapers in this town support the rebels. Over and over again have they falsely declared that the inhabitants were favorable to the rebels. A large public meeting was recently held on this subject, at which the supporters of the rebels fought with much tenacity. The meeting lasted four hours. They moved two amendents upon the original resolutions, and displayed a zeal worthy of a better cause. However, the original resolutions in favor of law and order and the abolition of slavery were carried by an overwhelming majority, not more than a dozen voting for the two amendments.
Your letter fully explains the reason of the virulent hatred of you displayed by the rebels and their supporters. You are terribly in earnest, and before that earnestness slavery is doomed, and with its doom the cause of the poor and the labourer in every land will receive an infinite support, which nothing can take away. The Committee trust you will persevere in your high and holy course whatever may be the consequences. You are no doubt aware that Russia is the real promoter of the rebellion. Many years ago Sir John MacNeill wrote in the Quarterly Review, ""The Cabinets and statesmen
of Europe are the tools with which Russia works."" Those tools have been worked by her in every way relative to the rebellion. Mr. Buchanan is one of her tools. Russia seeks universal dominion in order to permanently establish the aristocrats, the rich, the landowners, against the poor, the laborer. By the publication of your letter, if not before, you placed the filet on your brow, designating you for her victim. She will use every means to crush you, but the Committee trust you will escape her machinations.

Dear General: I arrived here Wednesday morning, and have been confined to my room ever since I have, however, seen a great many persons who have called to see me. The present plan no doubt is to send you back to New Orleans, but there is a strong party desirous of putting you in the War Department. I prevailed on the Republican members from
Illinois to call in a body on Mr. Lincoln and warn him of the dangers of continuing Stanton and Halleck in their present positions, but the interview was not satisfactory. Blair came in and interrupted them. They think that Mr. Lincoln is past doing anything with, he pays no attention to what his friends say. General Cameron called on me this morning and agreed to see Mr. Lincoln to-morrow and protest against your being sent South. He says Washington is your place, he will let me know the result of his interview with Mr. Lincoln, and I will write you. The truth is, that the President is about played out, and acts like a child. I am discouraged and out of all patience with him. Cameron says that you must be put where you can make yourself strong with the people, that you are the only man for next President. He wants me to go to Philadelphia, where he says I can be of more use in shaping matters for you than in any other place. I told him that I intended first to get well, and then I would be willing to go any place or do anything that was thought best.

"January 25, 1863","New York, January 25th, 1863
My dear Butler: In 1845 and 6, the year of my connection with O Sullivan in the Demo. Review, he was in Europe, and Caleb Cushing, Alex. Everett, Prof. Tucker of Va., Atty. Gen. Gilpin (H. D.), Dudley Field, B. F. Butler of N. Y., E. P. Whipple, Hawthorne, Whittier, etc., some twenty were contributors. After it was sold I penned a series of articles for Cotton's Whig Review on ""Foreign Immigration,"" one of which was a history of the Irish famine, as an inducing agency, and another, a resumé of the public and private charities of this city -- their necessity as related to the influx of foreign population. This connection with the press (afterwards with the Daily), which continued down to 1851, brought me into the centre of both the secret and open influences which shape and form public opinion in this central metropolis. In 1848, I wrote the pamphlet called the ""Great Issue,"" 200 pages, going briefly over the National Legislation on slavery from the Congress of 1774 down to that date. Gen. Dix and John Van Buren read my Mss., and the Gen. wrote for me two pages -- the history of the stormy session when he made two noted
speeches in the Senate. These and other associations have given me some knowledge of the real strength and influence of the men who are now actively prominent here.
And from the day of your first march through this city on your way to Annapolis, I have endeavored quietly among the press, and the strong loyal men here, -- those who give body to public opinion, -- to strengthen your good name whenever and wherever covertly attacked. I have done it not for any selfish ends, but both in memory of past pleasant scenes, and to aid the cause of our imperiled country. With an intimacy and warm attachment with the best men of the press here a sensible man can do a good work.
But I write to tell you how matters are shaping in regard to your proposed reception in New York. I met, day before yesterday, Mr. Prosper M. Wetmore, one of the most active of the committee. He says, and I know, there is a great desire to have you make a speech in the Academy of Music. They have circulated a petition to this effect, and it has already there been signed by over two hundred of the best men in New York, -- three ex-Governors, Morgan, King and Hamilton Fish, the Mayor of the city, Opdyke, and the Presidents of three colleges, President of Chamber of Commerce, and some of the first clergymen -- old Dr. Spring and Prof. Hitchoock, etc. After the speech, they propose a private banquet. Such a speech would go broadcast through thousands of presses over the country, and over all Europe. I hope you will make one of an hour at least, with all the simplicity, earnestness, and force, which can be condensed into the great and solemn truths of this crisis.
I was exceedingly gratified with the simplicity and directness of your remarks at Lowell and Boston.
President Lincoln was elected to discharge the ordinary duties of President of the United States. But thickening events brought responsibilities unforeseen and unheard of in the history of the world. He has no great lights of past experience to guide him. Forbearance was therefore a great virtue, until in every aspect of the crisis it ceased to avail. You were his agent at N. O. with delegated power, to act on the instant, when the struggle was one of life or death. You were far removed from the source of your power, with no past experiences in history, and only reason and constitutional or military law to guide. It is not strange if some errors were made, and you deserve all honor for having done so bravely and well.
It would be, it seems to me, a fit moment to receive in New York the cunning devices of our foe in New Orleans, and his abettors abroad ""to whip the devil round the stump"" and to prevent at all hazards the resumption of the Federal authorities in this chief city of the South. And in so doing to show without bitterness, and with that dignity which rises above it, incidentally the malignity of the charges made against you both at home and abroad.
This is what I would desire. You of course, see the whole horizon of your position, and can judge best. You have outlived in the events of this rebellion all motives for anything but the good of your country and a lasting fame, one founded in just, heroic, and good deeds. You have had and still have my fervent prayers. If God, in his Providence, has placed you as a marked agent in the path of his great events, to work in and for their accomplishment, may you have the courage to work calmly and fearlessly, trusting in Him unto the end. My kind regards to Mrs. Butler, and believe me, as ever,
Yours sincerely, O. C. Gardiner"

Maj. Gen. B. F. Butler, Washington, D. C.
My dear Sir: I suppose that you will have seen Gen. Hamilton before this reaches you. Matters have arrived at such a pass in this department as rendered our Texas affairs hopeless, under the present Military head. It is much to be regretted that Gen. Hamilton did not return to Washington a month sooner -- we could have been so far advanced towards a decision of some sort.
I have furnished Gen. Hamilton some late information from Western Texas, brought by a schooner last Saturday. To cut off the immense trade of the Rebel Government, being put under way by that, I submitted a plan to Gen. Banks, but he will not act upon it. I have sent a statement of the plan to Gen. Hamilton, who will show it to you if you desire it. From your knowledge of the country where that trade is carried on, I am satisfied that you will agree with me that the plan is feasible.
General Banks seems to have a complete disgust of everything relating to Texas. The Galveston disaster had completely upset him. The worst of the matter for us lies in the
queer idea he seems to have adopted, that all his troubles are in some way mixed up with Texas and Texans. Consequently he slights us in every possible way.
As it is probable the force intended to act in Texas will be largely made up of nine months' men already in this department, I have a suggestion to make which I think will obviate the objection to their use, on account of the shortness of the term they have still to serve. I find that the most of these men will agree to extend their term of service for six or nine months longer, on condition that they are immediately sent to Texas. An offer could also be made, conditioned on success, that each man should receive from the public lands of Texas from three to five hundred acres of land if he was willing to remain as a settler in the State. I believe all Unionists in Texas would willingly see our public lands disposed of in this way. At any rate, we must have some arrangement made by which the tern of service of the men composing the expedition shall be at least nine months after landing in Texas. With this arrangement, and say fifteen thousand men, the re-establishment of lawful authority in Texas is sure. Of course this class of men is not requisite for such a raid as I proposed to General Banks.
I trouble you with these particulars because I believe you are well-posted concerning our State, and take a sincere interest in our success; besides, it is not impossible that you may yet take an active part with us.
Truly yours, Edwin J. Davis"

in it, which has been, and is, probable from the aspect of affairs, should you not be called to fill a higher place, I have no doubt but what you would be offered the command of the Dept. of the Gulf, with probably a much larger field of action. I doubt not though by that time, if not already by this, it has become in your estimation no longer desirable. It would depend I presume somewhat upon the field they gave you, and the disposition of other Generals.
You have completely satisfied the public mind in this part of the country in your administration of affairs at New Orleans -- both Republicans and Democrats too; and then a cavil can always be traced to a no well-wisher of the Union.
Your original and summary method of dealing with rebels brings a smile to lighten the face of every one, in striking contrast to the lank, cadaverous countenance with which they view the prospect of affairs elsewhere.
It is as true that the West desire to see these rebels pummelled, as it is that there is a rapidly gaining genuine feeling of opposition to the radicalism of the administration, which will vent itself unless heeded, in confusion to our unhappy country.
I have been confined to my room by illness during the last five days. I shall leave for the East about the 7th if I get no orders in the meantime. I would like to see you or hear from you before I went on to Washington. On my arrival in New York, should you still be in Lowell, I will come on. I will go direct to New York.

Since your arrival in our city, I have addressed you upon several occasions, through the press and in private; and I
would do so once more before you leave our city-- the scene of your Herculean labors for the past seven months.  I thought of calling on you, and while bidding you a loving (?) farewell, informing you of the true light with which your departure is viewed by us. Self-respect, however, prevented me from doing so, as I feared contamination by even breathing the polluted air with which you are surrounded. Ever since you came among us, we have felt for you a hatred so violent that no words can express it. We have always regarded you as a monster in whose composition the lowest of traits were concentrated; and ""Butler the brute"" will be handed down to posterity as a by-word, by which all true Southerners will ""remember thee monster, thou vilest of scum."" When you came here, it was in your power to make friends instead of enemies, by marking your course with gentlemanly conduct, but that was foreign to your nature, and instead of treating the citizens of New Orleans with that respect and consideration which a civilized and refined people were entitled to, you heaped every indignity upon us that your brutal nature was capable of conceiving. Not content with thieving and stealing from all sorts and conditions of men, you insulted our best citizens, and used language to our gentlemen such as they never heard, and such as only you are capable of uttering. Even the ladies were not free from your vile imprecations. You have rendered yourself famous (as well as infamous) for your 28th order, and in all coming time your name will be linked with all that is loathsome and detestable.

You may possibly reach Yankeedom in safety-- but remember, vile old coward, that the day will come when you will be hunted down like a fox in your den, and retribution will surely fall upon you. There are noble, dauntless hearts in our Confederate army who will surely avenge the insults which you have heaped upon us.

"February 5, 1863","PRIVATE AND OFFICIAL CORRESPONDENCE OF GEN. BENJAMIN F. BUTLER
From General H. W. Benham
Portsmouth, N. H., Feb. 5th, 1863
Maj. Gen. B. F. Butler
Dear General: As I perceive you are still in Washington and being consulted upon war subjects, I cannot resist writing to you again to ask if you do not believe that the plan we talked of is the one of all others to save the country at this time, as I believe it to be the very crisis of the war.
Hooker cannot move for about two months by any possibility. If they attempt to send his forces round Jackson (or Lee) anywhere within 200 miles, or farther, through Pennsylvania to the West, the Rebels will surely know of it in time to send off troops to meet them, and to fortify effectually against them, even if some of the better generals were put in command on our side. There appears no strength of management on the whole line around from New Orleans on the Atlantic to the Potomac, and nothing can strike at the heart of Cottondom but that plan, and that must be arranged for this month if at all, or we are gone. The enlistments of the 350,000 2 years and 9 months' men will begin to expire in a couple of months, and although -- if we intend to continue the war to success -- the arrangements should now be in active progress to get new forces of even raw recruits to replace them as fast as their enlistments expire, yet still, as far as I can see, not a hand or a voice is raised for this purpose. And what can the result be in 5 or 6 months from this time, but that we shall have scarcely the shadow of an army, or at least of such an one as we have now? -- and if we fail in action till then, the government will find it impossible after that, simply impossible.
But if this is done, and if well and ably managed, it can be carried to success, and I believe will be a fatal blow to the rebels -- and if this so appears, as I doubt not it will to the country, one-half at least of these trained men will re-enlist, while others still, will then -- as they would not do otherwise -- be willing to come forward to fill up our armies. If you, as I feel you did do, still approve of that plan, I know you could carry it through.
My case is dragging along most singularly. In the War Department, after trying last July to have the Judge Advocate prepare charges against me, and finding he could not do it, they attempted to deprive me of my General's rank without any even pretended reason, and to the great surprise of the President when he was informed that the Sec. had dismissed me.
Then, after refusing me all information whatsoever as to the excuse for this act, through the whole year, and sometimes pretending one reason for it to one friend, and then another reason to another person, the President without referring to the War Department is finally induced to authorize the Judge Advocate General to examine my case expressly, promising to restore me if the report was favorable.
And now, though I am satisfied (though from information I cannot use publicly) that that examination has been made and that it required less than one day to establish that I have been right, that I ""have been shamefully treated,"" that the report ""strong and earnest"" in my favor has been before the President, that he expressed himself ""entirely satisfied"" and promised ""immediate restoration,"" yet he has still been resisted up to this time. Though I trust that that malice and falsehood will yet be triumphed over.
Should you go on duty soon and wish my services, I have no doubt your demand of them from the President would be assented to, and all my energies will be devoted to aid you in your duties.
Should you see the President about this, although the fact might be alluded to, to him that he has promised restoration upon a favorable report as he said in the presence of Senator Sumner, yet the circumstances that I have referred to as to the character of the report and his satisfaction and his repetition of his promise, and his delay in the execution of it, which has already continued many days, I offer you only as suggestions for inquiries, if you would make them, which, if answered,
you will find as I have indicated, I am satisfied: and with those things admitted to you, your demand for my services could not be refused.

Dear Sir: The steamer did not leave yesterday as was expected, and now I can reply to your letter with less hesitation.
I choose the office of ""Commissioner of Internal Revenue,"" as it is termed in your letter, and will assume the duties thereof whenever you direct. I suppose it to be an office rquiring my constant presence here, and whatever its duties may be I can discharge them to your satisfaction. Full instructions and all printed information will, of course, be supplied to me.
I sent to you Gen. Banks order respecting trade as soon as it was issued, and regret you did not receive it. You are mistaken in supposing it contemplates trade with the enemy -- of any kind or degree. Gen. Banks is utterly opposed to any such proceeding. The General's English is not always good, and his orders not always clear.
Do not think from my letter about Dr. Zachary that I intended to cast suspicion on Gen. Banks, who is not only [a] kind and pleasant gentleman, but also, I am satisfied, a thoroughly honest man. Dr. Zachary applied to me an hour ago for another of his Israelite friends to take a large stock of goods to Donaldsonville. The reason given is the same as before -- that the Dr. wants his friend's coöperation, which would be imperfect unless said friend pretends to be selling goods. I don't believe a word of it. The Doctor pretends to be my best friend, but I think him a humbug. I sent him to the General for an order and he has not yet returned.
Notwithstanding my personal regard for Gen. Banks, I repeat the conviction so often expressed before, that he is not the man for this important place. Gen. Butler is the only man who is equal to the situation, and he ought to come back.
I kept you well informed about Gen. Butler while he was here, and you know whatever wrong things were done by him. Four-fifths of the accusations against him are false.
I shall do everything in my power to help Mr. Bullitt when he assumes the duties of the office.

Post Office, New Orleans, Feb. 9th, 1863
My dear Butler: Things in this Department are, as is universally admitted, in a very bad way. Your canal is opened, and it is believed by all, secessionists as well as Unionists, that Vicksburg is no longer in the way of opening the river. It is expected that Gen. Banks will attempt to go by Port Hudson by going round it, entering the Bayou Lafourche at Platenmine, and into the Red River and back into the Mississippi. But this plan is expected to be defeated by rebels by cutting the levee and flooding the country, which it is said is already done. I wish you would write me on receipt of this and tell me the news -- all you think it safe and proper to communicate. What is the lowest for which I shall sell the yacht? I want to know the lowest and will do the best I can.

Quarter-Master General's Office, Washington City, February 11th, 1863
Brig. Gen'l. Meigs, Quartermaster Gen'l. U. S. A.
In the matter of the extra freight to the shippers of certain merchandise from New Orleans, retained by the Quarter-master at Boston, I desire to put before you the following statement of facts, to the end that these persons who put their property as ballast on board U. S. Transports may not be required to pay more than their Bills of Lading and contracts called for as justly due.
A large number of sailing vessels were at New Orleans discharged of troops and cargo, but entitled by the terms of their charters to be sent back in ballast, to the place of Charter, either New York or Boston.
Now, in New Orleans there was no ballast, and the only ballast to be had was at Ship Island, thirty hours distant for steam vessels, and an average of five days for sailing vessels. The only ballast to be procured there is white sand, to be brought alongside the vessels in small boats. This would cause great delay and large expense of demurrage, as well as cost of unloading and carrying away the sand at the port of debarkment.
Let me illustrate by a given case. The Steamer ""Mississippi"" is at New Orleans with a ""swept hold."" She is chartered at $1500. per day. She must have ballast, say 250 tons. To go to Ship Island and have sand brought along side in small boats will take at least 10 days; to discharge the same sand and haul it away will take four more. Thus it will cost the Government $21,000, to ballast and discharge the ship with sand, to say nothing of the cost of taking the sand away, or the average delays of getting it, if it storms at Ship Island. Now, if I can get some merchant to ship 400 Hhds. of Sugar in the ""Mississippi"" as ballast, which can be received in two days at most at the wharf where she lies, and discharged in two more, the Government will save $15,000 by the difference,
even if it gets nothing for freight. But by employing a party to get the ballast, see to its shipment, and take charge of the business, as a ship's broker, and agreeing to let him have all he can get over a given sum, say five dollars pr. Hhd. for his trouble and expenses of loading, the Government in the case given will save $2000 more. 4000 Hhds. at $5.00. Say in all $17,000.
Acting upon these opinions in pursuance to my report to the Secretary of War, of May 16th, 1862, I bought sugar with my own money, and had it shipped as ballast in some of the transport ships which were to return in ballast, and that sugar, if the transaction was not assumed by the Government, was to have allowed a reasonable freight.
Besides, I authorized and ordered contracts made with merchants for their merchandise, and had it put on board as ballast in several transport ships, allowing the party employed as ship broker to have fifty per cent for this trouble and expense.
These contracts were made in the most perfect faith by the merchants, and the money retained by the Government over and above the price fixed by the Bills of Lading should be refunded to them.
The freight in every instance to be paid to the Government was at the rate of five dollars per Hhd., which has been paid and is not asked to be refunded. Freight on the first of January last for sugar from New Orleans to New York was $2.50 per Hhd., so that the Government, if they pay back the excess, will still retain double the present rates of freight. Trusting that this act of justice will be done, I am.
Most fully, Your Obedient Servant,

Washington, D. C., February 11, 1863
Memorandum to accompany the accounts filed in the War Department, in the matter of the Item of $59,855 taken from Sam'l Smith & Co. Bankers.
This money was seized from Smith & Co. upon the belief that it was either the identical money taken from the United States Mint by the rebel superintendent, or else gold exchanged by him for silver which was paid out by the Canal Bank after the fleet passed the Forts, and by Smith concealed by being packed up in the rear of the vaults of his Banking House.
By agreement with Mr. Smith, the questions of this seizure were submitted to a Commission composed of Gov. Shepley, Dr. Mercier, President of the Louisiana Bank, and Thomas I. Durant, Esq., a leading lawyer of New Orleans. A protracted hearing was had, and full examination of evidence by counsel in behalf of the claimants, and report made that all but two pkgs., containing $50,000, be returned to Smith & Co., which was done. But as to the $50,000, that should be held by the United States subject to the disposal of the Government at Washington. This report was forwarded to the Secretary of the Treasury (see my letter enclosing same).
In the absence of funds to pay the troops, some of whom had been six months without pay, upon the decision of the commission, this with other monies were turned over to the Pay-Master -- Mayor Hewitt to pay the troops, and his receipt taken. When the money came for payment of the troops, this amount was replaced in my hands by the pay-master, and is now held for the use of the United States.
Smith & Co. are both active rebels, and have never returned to their allegiance. They have threatened to hold the General making the seizure personally responsible for this amount, and he only desires such order may be made as will, if the United States receives the money, relieve him from personal responsibility. All of which is respectfully submitted.

General: I have the honor to enclose another interrupted rebel communication from New Orleans, to a Montreal paper, for your perusal. I have the honor to be,
Very respectfully, Your obedient servant,
L. C. Turner, Judge Advocate
Enclosure referred to in Foregoing Letter
New Orleans, January 15, 1863 The advent of '63 to many a lacerated heart in New Orleans tended but to re-open afresh the bleeding wound caused by the departed memory of those held near and dear. And to renew an indescribable suspense on the part of parents, wives, and sisters, to learn the probable fate of those whose absence on the recurrence of the holidays detracted much, if not all, from its pleasures. And so general seemed to be the feeling of gloom that the New Year's day of 1863 must form a repulsive chapter in the social history of New Orleans, and offer a sad contrast with past years, when the desire of surpassing on the part of the hostesses was only equaled by their lavish hospitality, and the hearty welcome extended to their guests. A happy reaction was however felt towards the close of the day, 1st -- when news of a Confederate victory at ""Snyder's"" Bluff -- commanding the entrance to the ""Yazoo"" river --
was received, and the congratulations of the evening by far surpassed in earnestness those of the morning, and while it checked the appetite for ""food for scandal,"" offered enthusiastic and agreeable hopes for the ultimate safety of Vicksburg.
Indeed, the year has so auspiciously begun for the Confederate forces that while receiving daily accounts of the progress of events in the Mississippi Valley, scarce a dark cloud has overcast their progress, and this leaves the closing of the second week in '63 amongst the most important and favorable in the history of the C. S. On the 3rd, news of a daring and successful attack on Galveston. Texas, by the Confederates, reached here. And although news of the affair may have already reached you, yet judging a detailed account, as learned from a participant, to be of interest to you, I herewith forward it. At about 2 o'clock on the morning of the 1st, four (4) ordinary river packets, with cotton bales serving as bulwarks, emerged from the adjoining bayou, and made direct for the U. S. ""Harriet Lane,"" (since arrived in Mobile), which, together with some 4 or 5 other vessels of various capacity, but most formidable armament, served as a protection against an attack by sea. Commodore Renshaw, having had previous notice from Gen. Magruder, of his intention to hazard the recapture of Galveston, was duly prepared, and having steam up. and guns shotted, at once made preparations for resistance. This flagship (a remodeled N. Y. and Brooklyn Ferry boat, but carrying the heaviest and most formidable armament), the ""Westerville"" -- 10 guns, was, on signalling, immediately ""put about."" with a view of assisting the ""Harriet Lane."" Before any important resistance could be made, both vessels grounded at but a short interval, but meanwhile inflicting a loss of one of their boats to the Confederates, whose remaining three at once steered direct for the ""H. Lane."" On their nearer approach, so effectually did their sharp shooters play their part from off the cotton bales, that scarce a gunner lived sufficiently long at his post to serve his piece. The Confederates gradually nearing to boarding distance, were enabled to ply their work of destruction with more terrible effect. On touching, grappling irons were immediately attached by the boarding parties on both sides of the doomed vessel, when with a terrific yell the indomitable Texans sprang aboard, and so terrible was their work of retaliation for the firing without previous notice of Galveston by the Federal forces, that out of a crew of say 120 men, but
9 escaped to tell the tale. Commodore Renshaw, on realizing his perilous position on board the ""Westerville,"" exhibited prudential valour, and determined on the destruction of his boat, little anticipating such a disastrous event as the loss of his own life. As, time having been allowed for the crew to escape, a quick match was by mistake applied to the magazines -- which contained at the time some 40 tons of gun powder, and as the unfortunate man who committed the mistake was about stepping into the last boat with Commodore Renshaw, the explosion took place, immediately engulfing her living freight of 12 souls into eternity. The balance of the formidable crafts, acting on the Golden Rule of No. 1, hoisted a white flag (as learned from Gen. Magruder's official report), under the protection of which they ignominiously made good their escape to New Orleans, each vying with the other for the credit of first informant. Thus Texas has again won for herself those laurels which the community has reluctantly withdrawn from her on such testimony as was offered by some 150 or 200 refugees (from justice in all probability). Sam Houston and Col. Hamilton. And since her soil is once more freed from the invader, a people having no superior in bravery will look to its future sacredness and safety.
Southern dates to the 10th instant have been received informing us of a severe and bloody battle at Mumfreesboro, Tenn., and claiming a decided victory over Rosecrans, with a computed loss of from 20 to 25,000 men. As very meagre particulars are as yet to hand, it might be imprudent to anticipate the result. The more so, as from your late files of Northern papers you will be better able to form an idea as to the extent of the disaster. Should one have taken place in favor of the Confederates, too much importance cannot be attached to it by them. As it is universally admitted that this last act must form the closing scene in the Mississippi drama, and by the failure of which Vicksburg and Port Hudson must still prove the ""stumbling blocks"" towards the re-opening of the navigation, it will place Sherman and Grant in a very unpleasant, not to say hazardous position, and force McClellan to avail himself of the Yankee prerogative of flight to a safer vicinity than that of Vicksburg. Of which prerogative advices inform me that he has already availed himself, thus facing conclusive evidence of a Federal disaster at Mumfreesboro. Recent arrivals from the Eastern interior of La. bring news of the entire evacuation of that section of the state, bordering
on Texas, and including the parish of Lafourche, by the Federal troops. But heartrending must be the feelings of the despoiled, on beholding the desolation that followed in the train of the spoiler, and to find their once happy home a perfect scene of desolation.
The suppression of the National Advocate -- an arrant Union organ -- and withholding the reasons therefor from the public, would seem to intimate that the freedom of the press still remains limited, and subject to the dictates of the commanding General. While a fine of $25. imposed on an artist, for painting the portrait of Gen. Beauregard -- which by the way, can be purchased throughout the south for 25 cents! -- forcibly reminds the people of New Orleans that they still remain prisoners of war, and as such must patiently submit to the ""Powers that be."" Although the secesh element here anxiously await and pray for their speedy deliverance, yet the majority here so far become philosophers as to yield a forced obedience to surrounding circumstances, at the same time evincing a willingness to render all honor ""to whom honor is due,"" of which Gen. Banks will receive a due and liberal allowance, in the event of his adopting a more lenient policy!
Much and general inconvenience is felt owing to the lack of facilities granted by the U. S. authorities for ingress to the C. S. lines. And in this connection I may mention that Butler's last dodge has just come to light, wherein it has leaked out that in granting free transportation within the C. S. lines to registered enemies to the U. S., their ultimate destination was to have been ""Ship Island"" -- an uneviable place of banishment, which has become renowned in connection with the Ball and Chain, since the advent of Butler! -- but owing to the timely and fortunate arrival of Gen. Banks, the departure of the unfortunate confiding was happily prevented.
A significant and noteworthy change has taken place in our money market, in that U. S. Treasury notes have fallen from their elevated position, at which they commanded 10% premium to 4% dividend, and even at the latter reasonable figure are hastily rushed off for the city corporation ""shin plasters."" Bank notes and city railroad car tickets are only picayune circulating medium! --"

Maj. Gen. B. F. Butler, Washington, D. C.
Dear General: I thought a few confidential lines in which I could tell you unreservedly the true state of affairs here might not be uninteresting to you. The true feeling among the Union citizens was expressed by Judge Morgan yesterday, when he said, in presence of Judge Peabody and myself, ""I tell you there can not be found one solitary Union man in Louisiana that does not desire the return of Gen. Butler."" You can believe this to be the case when even Dr. Cottman and Julian Neville are said to pray for your return. Banks has done nothing with his troops as yet, I don't believe he will. The universal feeling here in military and civil circles is that there is less security and less strength here than before the Banks expedition arrived.
Banks has taken into his secret service Jacobs, Nay, Derrickson, and id genus omne. Their employment has been to try to rake up something against your administration.
A retired corn-doctor, Jew, by the name of Zachary, is here as a spy, said to be directly under the appointment of the President, but the intimate associate and confidential advisor of Banks. One of his employees has approached various persons with the assurance that if they could communicate any information that would tell against Gen. Butler, it would be highly appreciated by Gen. Banks. The Christ killers, as Andrew calls them, have it all their own way.
I have been remaining here in the hope of your return. I have about abandoned the hope that you will consent to come. When Clark and Brown see you they can tell you all the particulars about the state of things here.
They go home to-morrow. The Delta having been suppressed and the Ora started by Gen. Banks, everything seems to be done with a view of making it uncomfortable to those who were here with you. There will not be many of your old officers left in the service long. The Secesh humbug Banks, and then turn round and laugh at him, and sing out to each other ""Let the Union slide, Banks""!! For my own sake, and for the good of the cause in the South West, I wish you would come back. But whether there are any laurels to be plucked by you here, or whether you would like to come without the command exclusively of all the troops here, you can judge
best. I shall not stay here this summer if I can help it. Under present auspices some one else could be of more service to the government. Your old command here are greatly delighted with the attentions and favors bestowed upon you at the North.
Wherever you go, you will have the best wishes of the ""New England Division,"" and the hearty and fervent support of those whose pride it has been to serve under your command.
Yours, G. F. Shepley"

Dear General: Today Mr. Stanton showed me the orders to you to resume command of the Department of the Gulf, and told me that he was quite willing to strike out the second, which directs that the operations against Port Hudson shall be continued under the command of Gen. Banks, leaving to you the determination as to what direction they can be best promoted, and also so much of the first as directs you to proceed to your Dept. by the River.
It does seem to me that without the first of the modifications you ought to resume your post at once -- and that with it you ought most emphatically to do so. Mr. Flanders today expressed himself in very strong terms as to the necessity of your return, and every letter I receive from New Orleans is in the same key.
I am your friend because I have ever found you hold, manly, and patriotic; your friend because I flatter myself you are mine; your friend especially because you have well and faithfully served our poor country, -- poor, yet how rich. As your friend, allow me to say that you cannot rightfully or wisely withhold yourself from the true post of duty at this time, and that this post of duty is in New Orleans.
Go to New Orleans, General, and the sooner the better. Keep every speculator far from you, whether kinsmen, acquaintance, or strangers. Give your great administrative and executive abilities wholly to the great work of rejuvenating society in your Department after opening the Mississippi. Your countrymen will never forget your service, and it will be to your own remembrance and consciousness its highest recompense.
Faithfully yours, S. P. Chase"

Washington, D. C., Feb. 26th, 1863
Dear General: Upon our arrival here I delivered personally the letters intrusted to me, and also, as you requested, urged action upon various of the Senators and Members. Some I found had an intimation of what you disclosed, but they were all certain that it was not possible that such a result should come at this late day.
Senator Wilson does not think it possible to get the legislation now and at this late hour, but he will propose in various ways to push it. Mr. Gouch says his committee will in a day or two lay before the President (and the public) evidences of sufficient strength to warrant a movement by him for something besides a promotion of Gen'l. Mc.
The committee on the conduct of the war have had him (Gen'l Mc.) before them for the past two days, and at my writing the session is still going on -- all with favorable results. This is the move proposed to meet the danger you found. Whether it will or not remains to be seen.
We have made no progress as yet for Texas or for anything looking that way. We have no modification of the ""Order,"" and no explanation of why or wherefore it is as it is.
It seems to me that all things here indicate that we are losing ground, that is, those who have the earnest prosecution of the war at heart -- certainly nothing looks encouraging for us.
Sec. Stanton told a friend yesterday that General Butler was ordered to New Orleans and General Banks to Texas! I trust not, but if so I hope the first General will object successfully. We can never go there with Gen. Banks and his ideas, to say nothing of his Staff and their ideas, if they have any, and live it through.
The army of the Rebels would be better for some of the Texans -- they think there is a little hope of a Negro Enlistment Bill to-day, as the war offices have winked favorably at it; still, the Committee hardly feel yet permitted to act, as somebody may change his or their minds, and then it would be a mistake. When will all this world find their proper limits, and let men with brains manage what it is not necessary to have lost?

Private Baton Rouge, Feb. 26th, 1863
Dear General: I came up to this place the other day from your city of New Orleans. I say your city, for I find you are the man they all swear by in that village -- both sides, one swearing by you, the Loyalists, and the other side about you, the Rebels. But I think with the loyal people you are more popular here than in New England, and it would seem with good reason. You have taken good care of these people
when they needed care; whereas, in the North, we are thus far able to take care of ourselves. But I find the soldiers are very anxious for your return to this department. It is true of the men whom Gen. Banks led hither in as strong sense as of your old soldiers. They seem to be profoundly and sincerely attached to you, and I find my own welcome in this camp arises mainly from a knowledge which some of the officers have that I am a friend of yours. Among others of your friends whom I have met here is Dr. Kellogg, who from the circumstances referred to above has been most kind to me, and has shown me everything that is to be seen besides entertaining me at his quarters in this town of poor hotels. But the Dr. is not satisfied with his present position, and will not be unless you return here. A young man of 28 years is his superior, and pretty insolent at that, I judge, and having none of the experience or knowledge of the country and its diseases which Dr. Kellogg seems to possess. The Dr. feels very much as you would, in old times, acting as Junior counsel with Manett as Senior. If you don't return, I hope, as the Dr. seems to desire, that he may be appointed Surgeon in the regular army.
Gen. Grover seems to be quite unpopular here. He never sees his men. He keeps at his quarters, or, if he rides out, rides away from the field where the soldiers encamp. But his orders seem to be singularly lacking in wisdom. They are obviously emanations from the same source as these extraordinary concessions to rebellion which Gen. Banks has so recently issued, to the surprise of everybody who has any other than rebel blood in his veins. The rebels hover near the confines of this town. A fight, at any time, may come off here as well as at Port Hudson, and the results, no man can venture to predict. If Gen. Banks with his great army holds what you left him, I think the country ought to be satisfied. It may have to be satisfied with much less.
I shall return by an early steamer after this, to the North. If you have any orders for me to execute when I land at New York, send your commands to my address at the Astor House.
Yours truly, J. A. O. Griffin
P. S. Major Green is up here looking after two fellows, one named Johnson and one Lachane, both from New York, who seem to be spies sent by somebody to find out, if they can, anything against your administration of affairs here in this
department. Such is the statement Major Green makes to me, and asks that I append it to this letter, I have, of course, no personal knowledge on the subject. But I hear from the officers that three men are here for apparently no other purpose than that supposed or known by Major Green to be their mission."

Lowell, Feb. 28th, 1863
My dear sir: I have read a sketch of a debate in the Senate in which you were kind enough to express confidence in the rectitude of my official action.
There was an allusion by Mr. Davis to the plate and furniture of a person in St. Louis taken by me. I understand that Alexander Brothers is the party meant. He escaped from New Orleans, and went to St. Louis without taking the oath of allegiance, under a pass procured by the intervention of a professed Union man, whom I have since ascertained to have been a scoundrel, whom Brothers alleges to have bribed to get the pass for him. Brothers was one of the rebel Provost Marshals, having in charge the city, by whom the immense destruction of property was made on the arrival of our fleet.
Brothers' plate and furniture was taken possession of by
my order, and was turned over to Gen. Banks' Quartermaster when I left the Department of the Gulf, and I have his receipt therefor.
I especially thank you for your offer to have an investigation. I am ready at any and all times. I cannot of course answer newspaper paragraphs and slanders, but Mr. Davis, if he is an honest and just man, can be satisfied upon every point by simply asking me by letter. If he will not do this, but will persist in slandering a public officer without inquiry from a place given him by the secession of better men than himself, which he could never have got without that fortunate occurrence, then he is simply the scoundrel and thief he would fain have me believed. Breckenridge was at least a gentleman, and there does not seem much to choose in loyalty between the former and present incumbent save that the first was a courageous traitor.

"February 28, 1863","From General Butler to Salmon P. Chase
Lowell, Feb. 28th, 1863
My dear Sir: I have to thank the spirit of friendship which dictated your letter of the twenty-fourth.
I would I could see my way quite clear to follow the counsels of one who can so well advise, and who would so truly direct me in so far as the truest friendship demands.
You strongly advise me to accept willingly the command of the Department of the Gulf upon the terms set forth in the project of an order from the President, as proposed to be amended by the Secretary of War.
Deep respect for your opinion leads me to attempt to direct your thoughts carefully to the position offered me by the Order, to see if our minds may not be brought to the same conclusion from an examination of the subject from the same point of view. Let me premise, however that I think I can divest myself of all personal considerations in the matter, and be governed solely by those which tend to the public service, because the very offer by the President of a return to the Department of the Gulf is of itself a most complete personal vindication, and entirely satisfies any personal wish I could entertain on the subject of my relief from that Department, and if in the course of the point I present I speak of myself, I beg you to read simply an impersonation of a proposed command of that department.
The proposed amended order offers: 1st. The command of the Department of the Gulf.
2nd. That as soon as the river shall be opened. Gen. Banks shall be sent to Texas with a sufficient force.
What service then can be done under this order?
I can reach New Orleans the first of April.
There are 50,000 effective troops in the department excluding negroes, but of these thirty-five thousand are nine months' men, whose term of service will expire in ninety days from the day of my arrival; troops collected under enormous bounties, not for war but for money; men counting the days until their term of service expires, as did the three-months men in the summer of 1861; actually in the latter part of their time, chalking up on the side of their barracks thirty marks, and rubbing out one as each day was got rid of that intervened between their return, and at last at noon rubbing out a half mark as the time dragged slowly away. The same kind and worse troops from the nature of the case than those who marched home from the first Bull Run, with the enemies' cannon thundering in their ears as they went; the same kind of troops to whom Washington issued his severest orders against plundering; the same kind of troops of whom Jackson shot six for deserting him in the face of ""savage enemy""; they claiming by a construction of law only security against the fact that their time had expired; officers without hope but of speedy disbandment; without ambition except soon and safely to get home, that they may elsewhere obtain permanent and honorable service.
I need not and do not make personal application of these remarks to the very men in the department of the Gulf, but merely enumerate these psychological facts resulting from the operations of the human mind in men enlisted for a short and now just expiring term of service. This is simply history teaching by example. These are the infelicities of short enlistments.
Without stopping to enquire who perpetrated the enormous blunder of sending two thousand miles away forty thousand of these useless troops, at an expense at a low estimate of three hundred dollars each for transportation down and back; say, twelve millions of dollars, a sum which for all the use it has been to the Government had better been thrown in the sea. Let us see how they are to be got back. Where is the transportation to come from? Is not the Commanding General at
New Orleans simply to be resolved into a magnified transportation agent, to send home this force in the meantime. If he allows their term of enlistment to expire, then he has simply so many mutinous mobs on his hands to be controlled and guarded by the rest of his force. It is useless to say these men will re-enlist there -- if they re-enlist at all, as doubtless many of them will, it will not be till after they have come home to visit their wives and sweethearts, and to tell Othello-like their ""hairbreadth escapes by blood and field."" But where is the transportation to come from? There has been already one investigation over the frauds in getting them out there. Is it a pleasant prospect for a Commanding General to think he must be liable to another in getting them back? Can not, ought not a General to have other and grander objects of contemplation in the service to his country than these? Especially when he has seen all this brought upon the country against his remonstrance, without his aid, and largely by his removal from a post of duty which you now urge him to re-occupy. I will do it if ordered, or take the consequences, but I do not think that this command is one to be taken by consent, nothing ought to come but discontent, disquiet, disgust, and disaster, and if anything else does come it will only be a good fortune which could be had once in a lifetime. I see how it would be! I should be left with only the brave troops with which I spent the last summer at New Orleans. to try the fate of another epidemic season with our constitutions unfitted by previous exposure; our blood decarbonized; our energies unstrung by inaction and hopelessness.
Let us revert for a moment to the second part of the order, ""that Gen. Banks is to be sent to Texas with a sufficient force when the river is opened."" Where is that sufficient force to come from? Certainly I would not be the means of sending these nine months' troops five hundred miles farther away, and there are no others in the Department save enough for garrison duty, of its various posts from Pensacola to Galveston.
You may say, enlist the negro. True, I had high hopes from the enlistment of the negro. I enlisted my third regiment of Native Guards, colored, in fourteen days, a thousand strong. But something has happened in the Department of the Gulf which has changed all that. What it is I do not know. I resolutely disbelieve all newspaper stories as a foundation of action, but certain it is that General Banks has been there more than five times fourteen days, and has not
filled up his first regiment of colored men. Certain it is that many things have changed there beside the change of Generals. They even shoot at the Commanding General with air-guns now, so that he will soon realize Carlyle's description of the French ""Citizen, King the Great shot at, but not yet shot,"" -- with an air gun.
If I am not misinformed, it will take months to restore in the negro in Louisiana that reliance upon the Justice, that confidence in the power, that appreciation of the good will, and that trust in the good faith of the Government of the United States which he had on the 15th day of December last. Quarreling with officers, men willing to fight the common enemy because they are not white, was unknown at that date; depriving energetic and accomplished officers, to whom the commissions of the President had been given by his order, and to whom the faith of the Government was pledged by their commissions, because their ancestors, more or less remote, were part of African descent: to allow one portion of the troops armed for the defence of the country to contumeliously insult another, because of their color, when all have equal rights, arms, uniforms, and so far as had been seen, equal courage, was unheard of in the Department of the Gulf in 1862, and in my judgment such acts as are reported to have transpired in that department since will tend more to discourage and hinder the enlistment of colored men than months of true justice can remedy. The negro, whether the equal of the white man or not, knows when he is treated fairly, and appreciates an injustice quite as enduringly as if of a lighter color. Your horse even knows when he is whipped without fault on his part and because of his rider's ill-temper or caprice. No one asks the negro to be admitted to our battles upon social equality, but it is asked, and all just men must concede to him, equality of right, nay the superiority even, which courage and conduct gives the brave man upon the battlefield, and lastly that equality that an honorable death gives to all in the grave. How can we expect the black man to stand up against the white rebel when we allow him to be insulted by our own soldier because he is white?
I feel deeply upon this subject, my friend, and I may write sharply, but for one, I never will ask the color of the man who exposes his life to protect mine upon the same battle-field in defence of the honor of my country.
Whether the negro will fight or not, let the chosen legions
of the first Napoleon vanquished by the half-armed insurgent of San Domingo answer.
What may have been the debasing influence upon his courage by his association with white man I cannot say, but I must not forget that hé is a slave only because his ancestor was a captive of war, ay, and in a hand-to-hand conflict too -- of a chieftain who made war upon his tribe. Can the sons of the tobacco-bought mothers of Virginia say as much? Whether the negro will fight, let the second last Napoleon answer by his acts in hiring them to do what the veterans of the Crimea cannot do -- whip the Mexicans.
Pardon this digression. The negro won't fight, however, if he is not justly and fairly treated -- and I do not think it is just or fair treatment to ""induce"" him to go back to work on his master's plantation for three dollars per month, when as a skilled mechanic he can get forty elsewhere.
I have adverted to these matters in order that you may see how my mind has been balanced in weighing my duty to the country as to going back to New Orleans. I believe time, a long time too, can only repair the mischief that has been done there in the mind of the negro. Kindness, justice, and a continuance of them will alone convince him that the Government is in earnest with him, and that some political intrigue will not recall the man in whom he has confidence, and substitute another who will proclaim that freedom to him is a ""purpose only"" to be carried out in some future but indefinite time. The wrong done the negro in that department by the action of the Government there has a most material bearing in my mind upon the question of accepting the command of the Gulf.
But you will answer that when the river is opened you can have troops enough from the army of Mississippi.
Ah, my friend! I have tried that experiment in June last. I lay at New Orleans with scarcely 6000 men, and sent a force of four thousand to Vicksburg, counting on support from Gen. Halleck's army, then lying at Corinth, Beauregard having just then successfully retreated to Tupelo. The finest army of the country reported a hundred and sixty thousand strong. We begged for a few men to help us at Vicksburg because -- 's and Breckenridge's divisions had reinforced the enemy -- but not a soldier could we get. That fine army of Gen. Halleck went up or down, I don't know which, do you? and was never heard of after. I prayed for men from Washington
and from General Grant, and could get them from neither source, and why not? Because I could not command them to march to our relief. The country is now suffering from that mistake. If Halleck's army had kept Beauregard's from reinforcing Vicksburg, or if Halleck or Grant had sent me as many men as were sent to help the enemy, in either event; Vicksburg would have been taken, the river opened, and the great loss of blood and treasure now incurred to open it saved. I will never voluntarily put myself as a suppliant for troops from another department. If the Government mean that I shall have the troops to do anything with; let them give them to me at once. Or at least the order for them. But you will say that there are no troops to be had. Let me have those at Port Royal until they are ready to be moved. Let us strike on the Mississippi, open Port Hudson and Vicksburg. The generals at Port Royal will have got over their difficulties by that time, and the ordnance stores for which they are waiting will have been prepared. The siege guns which they need will have at least been shipped.
Let something be done or let me see that something can be done except pitiful intrigues by which I am removed from command, and the arrow shall not leave the bow with a swifter flight than I into the service. But with the expectations of the country roused into a belief that I can achieve something like success, I cannot of my own will be sent into that honorable exile again to which Scott banished me at Fortress Monroe. without men, without means, and without support, as a punishment for taking Baltimore without his column of 12,000 men.
These are the views, written Currente Culamo, which influence my decision in regard to the department of the Gulf. Am I not right? There is one observation in your letter I cannot let pass without comment. You say ""put far away speculators."" Is it possible you still believe those foolish lies which interested and disloyal men set afloat about me, failing to find any other point vulnerable? I think the merchants of New York whose commerce with New Orleans is now drooping in death would desire some General there who could rescue it from the grave. Some one who would not permit rebel bankers to issue their notes irredeemable in specie and put them above United States legal tender notes. Oh, my friend, the Secretary of the Treasury! Some general capable of so managing his own financial affairs that it would not be necessary
to take with him as financial aids a speculator in the --, and a defaulting Massachusetts liquor agent to take care of his finances. But enough of this. Every act of mine is open to investigation. I defy my enemies and trust my friends, no one of whom need fear for me.
I have written plainly, distinctly, because I am writing to a friend, who can appreciate the very plainness of my speech. To a neutral or an enemy I might use the words of diplomacy, but to you whom I so much respect and esteem I can write as I feel, in the words of truth and soberness. Be assured that I appreciate most highly the kind action of the President in offering me again so high a command, and I would do anything consistent with my solemn views of duty to my country to do him a service to show that grateful appreciation. The whole matter may be summed up in a word, -- I see no service to the country to come out of the proposed command unless troops can be given to finish the work on the Mississippi and in the Gulf, or the means of getting them on Mississippi River.
The war will either go on successfully in abler and better hands than mine, or some crisis will come in the affairs of the country -- like that which called me from my quiet home in April, 1861 -- when my service will be needed, which will find me ready. Again thanking you for your thoughtful kindness, believe me your friend.

The ""Star of the West,"" the ""Queen do,"" and the ""Indianola"" at perfect liberty to carry a flag of truce down to the Crescent City, and nothing but the ""Essex"" to fire a salute for them as they

Called to pay my respects to Mrs. Banks after the dinner, and what should she do but begin about her husband's troubles and the desponding tone of his letters.
I sympathized and berated the Government for its shameful abuse of him, -- sending him off there in not the best of health, likely to fall under the wing of Yellow Jack, and finally, with no troops to work with. (Query -- How will he feel, about June?)
Stopped at Frank Howe's store yesterday and met the Quarter Master, who was left behind to forward the last half of Banks' expedition. He says that things are in a -- of a fix in the Dept. of the Gulf.
Now let me issue a ""Gen. Order,"" which runs to the effect that Seward rules the country and Weed rules Seward. McClellan will soon have a command, as he is a friend of both. Banks is his friend (as well as Seward's), and he will be got out of those swamps before the hot weather comes on. They will try to make him Sec. of War, and I've no doubt they'd like to have you go back bye and bye, as things grow darker and the weather grows hotter.

Dear Sarah: I just received yours from Washington dated from the 15th to 18th ult. I write more to say we are all well, and that I have received yours, than because there is anything here worth communicating. Whether you or Harriet will get this I am somewhat in doubt, as I look upon the chances as nearly, not quite, even, that you may be on the way here.
It seems matters in Washington are controlled still pretty much as we have always expected; though it seems there must be some shaking in that quarter. If the troops here are moving up the river in anticipation of an attack at Baton Rouge -- as incredible as this must seem to you, such is believed the actual state of things. Capt. George writes me that he has accepted Col. Butler's drafts on me to more than the amount of all the sugars, after paying the necessary expenses. I think worse and worse of that whole affair. I have written George to hold enough for my security at all hazards, and to make no final settlement until I am there.
If the Gen. does not come out here I want he should write at once the lowest amount for which I shall sell the Yacht, and then I will get all I can. The small boat upon the yacht has been taken by order of the Deputy Surveyor, upon the ground that Ex-Collector Dension claims that it is his private property. I shall see Dension about it immediately. The market for sugar and cotton here advances faster than my ideas, and hence I never buy. If the war is not brought to an end in less than a year, gold will be more than twice the price of greenbacks. If you have any investments to make, buy gold, and I don't know as it makes much difference what you give for it, as it will continue to advance. If you have not started write me at once, as I shall come home in April whatever becomes of matters here or elsewhere. The rise of goods must help Read very much, and he will come out ahead, I think, though he has been nearly skinned alive.
Though business is terribly dull here I could get along very well were it not for the terrible reflections of what has happenned at home since I came here.

Maj. Gen. B. F. Butler, Lowell, Mass.
My dear General: Enclosed is a copy of a letter which I lately sent to Prof. Marshall, a friend of mine, and ardent Union man, at Leeds, England.
I hope it may not be distasteful to you, as I am willing, of course, you should show it to whom you please.
Sincerely Yours, Horatio King
Enclosure referred to in Foregoing Letter
Washington, Feb. 25th, 1863 Prof. J. W. Marshall, United States Consul, Leeds, England
Dear Sir: Your letter of the 25th Oct. came duly to hand, and I have to reproach myself for my neglect in so long omitting to acknowledge its receipt. I have also to thank you for a copy of a Leeds newspaper, in return, I presume, for a number of the National Intelligencer which I sent to you. I was much pleased with an editorial article upon Gen. Butler in the Leeds paper, and as he happened to be here at the time I had the pleasure of presenting it to him, and it was subsequently copied into one of our city papers.
It was refreshing, after being obliged to read so much in the London, Times and kindred English journals revolting to all our feelings of friendship, to peruse an article from an English source on the whole so just toward the United States and Gen. Butler in particular.
The fact is, he is undoubtedly one of our ablest Generals, and if all had been like him the rebellion would have been far
less successful than it has been. It is not an extravagant opinion to advance that at the commencement of our troubles, by his bold dash into and taking possession of Baltimore, he saved Washington. That city was reeking with treason, its police and a majority of its councils were in the interest of the secessionists, arms and munitions of war in great quantities had been collected there, and everything was ripening for a coup de main, which, in conjunction with the rebel hordes in Virginia, was to place the seat of the National Government, with all its archives, in the hands of the insurgents, when they were surprised one morning to find Gen. Butler had effectually frustrated their plans by quietly taking possession of the city. He was equally energetic and fortunate in his expedition to North Carolina; but nowhere has it been more apparent that the right man was in the right place than while he was in command at New Orleans. His strict discipline saved thousands of lives. The summary hanging of Mumford was an act of mercy, for it operated as a solemn warning against all further attempts there to feed the desolating fires of treason by openly insulting the Flag of the Union.
The celebrated Woman Order. I at first regarded as rather unfortunately worded. but I have the authority of a most intelligent lady, who resided in the South when the rebellion broke out, and remained there, -- most of the time in Memphis until August last, -- for saying that it was exactly what was required, and that it produced the desired effect. It brought ladies to their senses, and taught them to see what they should never have overlooked that to insult an officer or soldier in the manner so many of them had done was a pretty sure sign that they had no claim to the title of lady. Nor was it local in its effect. It was as potent for good in Memphis and throughout the South as it was in New Orleans.
Of course Gen. Butler is unpopular with the rebels and their Northern sympathizers; but he commands the respect and confidence of all true friends of the Union. The flattering welcome extended to him recently in Boston, Baltimore, and other cities is proof of this; and there is the strongest desire felt to see him again entrusted with some important command where the Government may continue to have the benefit of his abilities.
You will have observed that the President's Emancipation Proclamation has not had the happy effect its advocates predicted
for it. On the contrary, its tendency, I fear, has been not only to intensify the hatred of the rebels toward the Government, but to strengthen the northern opposition to the administration at a time when all party spirit should be ignored, and discourage the conservative portion of the community, from which the administration heretofore derived its greatest support in the prosecution of the war. Nevertheless, the great body of the people of the loyal States are united in the determination to subdue the rebellion and preserve the Union; and all that is needed to render them as enthusiastic as ever is that our armies in the field shall achieve the success which, under proper guidance, they will certainly accomplish. They believe more in hard blows against the military power of the South than in proclamations; and if slavery suffers thereby few will care; but they do not believe in making this a war for the direct abolition of slavery. Here is the point of difference between the conservative and radical abolition element at the North, and this difference, more than anything else, serves to weaken the administration in its struggle with treason.
The number of those in the loyal States, who are at heart dis-unionists, is comparatively small; yet there is no doubt that they do great injury to the Union cause by their constant denunciation of the administration, by the grossest misrepresentation, and by giving information to the enemy. It is from this class that the loudest complaints come of arbitrary arrests, when, had they deserts, many of them would long since have been hung. Ever ready to denounce any act of the Government calculated to restrain the liberty of rebel sympathizers, you never hear a word from them in condemnation of the savage cruelties practised by their Southern friends upon all in their midst, without regard to sex or age, who dare to acknowledge their allegiance to the United States. Doubtless some arrests have been made by our military authorities without sufficient cause; but where one such mistake has occurred, hundreds have been permitted to go at large, enjoying all the blessings of the government, when they should have been either locked up or sent beyond the lines. If the government has erred in this, it is in having been too lenient to traitors.
Not even known spies are dealt with as we have always been taught they should be, condemned and executed; but the extent of their punishment hitherto has been simple imprisonment, and this, perhaps, only for a few weeks, when they have
been suffered to depart on taking the oath of allegiance, to be violated as soon as taken.
Notwithstanding the war, our public buildings here are approaching to completion, the work upon them never having been discontinued. The beautiful dome of the Capitol is nearly ready to receive its crowning ornament, the bronze Goddess of Liberty, by Mills, and the west front of the Treasury building, already presents a row of massive granite columns corresponding with those on the south side, the roof is nearly finished, and many of the rooms are occupied. Meantime a street railway has been completed within the past few months, running from Georgetown to the Capitol, railroad depot, and the Navy Yard, from the steamboat landing to near the northern boundary of the city on 7th street, and from Pennsylvania Avenue along 14th street, also to the northern boundary near Columbia College.
So you perceive, and I wish our English friends also to know, that we here have no idea of giving up the Union. I say ""our English friends,"" for we still believe the people of Great Britain, as well as Her Majesty, the Queen, and His Royal Highness, the Prince of Wales, are the fast friends of the United States.
Neither they nor we have forgotten the pleasure of his visit amongst us; and should France, with a view to secure Mexico, be so unwise (which I cannot think possible) as to unite with the South by an armed interference in our affairs, it is easy to see on which side Great Britain must be.
Very Respectfully and Truly Yours, Horatio King

Yesterday I was at Washington, and it is in consequence of what I learned there that I write this brief note. Friendship will excuse whatever of plainness there may be in it.
The offer of the Gulf command is, I learn, still open to you, and your best friends are anxious that you should accept it at once, as they do not know how soon it may be impracticable to have it continue open. They wish you to accept it even though you cannot have the class of troops which you
desire, and they express the fear that if you insist on terms too much, your reputation may suffer somewhat, as has been the case with Fremont and Hay, and for your own sake they want the suspense ended, as they do not see where another opportunity so eligible is likely to occur soon. I confess that after what I heard I shall hear with pleasure that you are making preparations for departure to N. O.
I understand that your command could be full and without restrictions, and where I obtained my information it was hoped that your acceptance would not be delayed a week.
I found that Sumner had not kept along with your case since you left, having been abroad in the matters of his special department. But if you desire fuller information he would doubtless provide it, and he is always so sincere that his suggestions would prove of value.
My great desire to see still further advanced the reputation which you have so worthily won must be my excuse for what would be otherwise impertinence.

Hon. Secretary of War
Sir: I have to acknowledge the receipt of the copy of the letter of Lord Lyons, relating to the claim of A. Kernahan, to the Hon. Secretary of State, referred to me for report.
The claim is based upon grounds that Kernahan is a British subject who has never forfeited the protection of his Government by an act of hostility to the United States. Whether Kernahan was born a British subject I am not informed, but before hearing of the matter which took place before me the following facts appeared.
A. Kernahan had resided many years in New Orleans, taking part in the usual civic affairs as a citizen, and received the protection of the United States in his person and property, and was a very active sympathizer with the rebellion. After the occupation of the city by the United States forces, Kernahan, as the Agent of some rebel organization, went to Holly Spring and Canton, Miss., within the rebels lines, for the purpose of superintending the Confederate wounded and sick soldiers, and especially those from Louisiana, was still in the service of the rebels on the 10th of Sept. 1862, and was then contemplating farther enterprises in their behalf. His affidavit denies that he was in the service of the ""Confederate Government,"" but does not deny that he was in the service of the rebels. He admits that he wrote a letter dated at Canton, Miss. Sept. 10th, and that letter was intercepted by the United States Authorities at New Orleans. A copy of that letter is appended hereto duly certified, and makes an entire and perfect case against his neutrality.
It will be observed that the first pages speak of his employment in case of the Rebel sick and wounded before referred to, and the whole epistle breathes all over with inimical expressions of his rebel sympathies. It might be difficult, I think, to
explain for him such phrases as ""if we are to have a winter campaign, Nashville will soon be a good location; at present the Yanks have it, but they must soon quit."" ""Good news from Kentucky, we will soon have that state."" ""Our news from Virginia is such as to give us great hopes,"" ""The Yanks are all driven to Washington, and we are shelling Arlington Heights,"" ""We have heavy losses, the enemy nearly double,"" ""In thirty days I hope the border states will be all ours,"" -- consistently with the writer's neutrality.
Even his wish that the Commanding General may escape the fever does not avail him in that behalf, because he only desires it ""until some of our men can reach him."" Also another. His postscript that ""we know of three Ironclads, gunboats in these seas, English made,"" shows evidence of British neutrality, which now has the notoriety of ""Prince faith.""
Indeed, Mr. Kernahan is rather above the average specimen of foreign neutrals so far as I saw them in New Orleans. The money of Kernahan has been accounted for to the United States, and the tobacco & brandy were put into the United States Warehouses. Mr. Kernahan has forfeited all claim to the protection of his Government, as well as that of ours.

The Hon. E. M. Stanton, Secretary of War
Sir: I have the honor to acknowledge the receipt of the letter of Lord Lyons to the Hon. Sec'y of State with enclosures, relating to the claim of Louisa A. Keegan for indemnity, with directions to report thereon. The facts appearing before me were substantially these, and upon these, I based my judgment. Messrs. Brummer & Co., of New York, merchants, made claim against the co-partnership of Keegan & McCann, doing business in New Orleans at 144 Canal Street, for dry goods sold that firm to be used in their business in Louisiana, that in the store occupied by them was found a portion of the same goods sold by Brummer & Co. to Keegan & McCann. Brummer & Co. claimed redress from the U. S. Military Authorities, the city being under martial law, in default of the United States Courts. The parties appeared before the Commanding
General, when it was admitted that a just debt was owing from Keegan & McCann to Brummer & Co. for goods so sold, some of which were then in the store, 144 Canal Street, New Orleans, and such debt had not been paid. But it was claimed that the goods now belonged to Louisa A. Keegan, a daughter of the senior partner of the firm of Keegan & McCann, who was just then said to have come to the age of twenty-one years, and at the time absent with her father on a voyage to New York and elsewhere.
It further appeared, that the business was now carried on in precisely the same manner that it had theretofore been by the firm of Keegan & McCann in the same books. Louisa A. Keegan claimed title in the goods by virtue of a sale under the authority of Courts of Louisiana since her secession, and that from the act of the law of the Confederate States she had obtained title thereto.
It further appeared that the large majority of the creditors of Keegan and McCann were in the loyal States, and could and did have no voice in these supposed legal proceedings, which indeed seemed to have been instituted for the very purpose of depriving these loyal creditors of their right. No explanation was or could be given of the singular fact that this young girl, the daughter of one of the firm of small Irish traders, should have in her own right so large a sum of money, and be ready and able to invest it in such a business at forced cash sale of her father's stock in trade.
After a full hearing, I was fully of the opinion that the whole proceeding was fraudulent and void as regards the creditors of Keegan & McCann, and that the sale was colorable, made to defraud the loyal creditors of that co-partnership.
But, however that might be, even if mistaken in point of fact that the sale of the goods not having been made by Keegan & McCann themselves, but by the decree of a rebel court, executed by rebel Officers, that such was wholly void and nugatory, and passed no title whatever, and certainly not against the loyal creditors of the owners, that no title therefore passing to Louisa A. Keegan, she could make no claim for the goods.
I, therefore adjudged and ordered that Brummer & Co. should take enough of goods of Keegan & McCann to satisfy their claim, which was done, the goods being sold at auction up to that amount.
I have been perfectly satisfied with that decision, and
should act upon the matter in precisely the same manner again. I believe whoever shall read this report will agree that fair equity and justice was done, and if so, that was due execution of the only law then in Louisiana, i. e. martial law, which the Duke of Wellington defines to be the will of the Commanding General, exercised according to the principles of natural equity. This certainly must be good authority for Lord Lyons. I have the honor to be,

Private. New York City, March 24th, 1863
Maj. Gen. B. F. Butler, Lowell, Mass.
Dear Sir: Can't you suggest some way in which relief can be got for the people of Western Texas? There were at last accounts some 2,000 loyal Texans, with but a scanty supply of arms and without powder and caps, on the Mexican side of the Rio Grande, waiting in vain for help from our Government to enable them to drive off or capture the 400 secession troops on the other side of the river.
Since I first saw you in New Orleans last summer, I have endeavored to bring every appliance to bear to get aid for the
loyal men of my state, and this moment success seems farther off than ever. My efforts have been made without any view to personal advancement, for I never have been willing, and am not now, to take my office civil or military from the United States Government as at present constituted, though I will do my share towards sustaining it as it is the only hope that we have.
Before we had been twenty-four hours in New Orleans after the arrival of the so called ""Banks Expedition,"" I came to the conclusion that your successor was (as Shakespeare has it) one of those animals whom in all languages we call fools; and told my comrades from Texas so; and urged them to return with you. Hamilton was blarneyed and humbugged along for several weeks, when he at last, too late for his own good, got his eyes open. In the meanwhile I had to remain there against my will, until finally my friend Mr. Stevens, of this city, consented to return with me. I am now remaining here for the whole object of trying to get relief for Texas, and wish to try any and every means of effecting that end that may be feasible. I had hoped that when Hamilton returned from New Orleans to Washington he would have common cause with yourself, but in that I was again disappointed. In consequence, he has been beaten at every point. His nomination was not sent in to the Senate, and he is now speaking, as the phrase goes, ""on his own hook"" in Connecticut. I have no confidence in his being able to effect anything for Texas.
Mr. Secretary Stanton is against us, and Gen. Halleck in imitation of the original genius in Swift, who, when he had to build a house, set to work at the top of the chimney and worked on gradually down to the foundation, has replied to the resolution of the N. Y. Chamber of Commerce, recommending that the trade of the rebel Government with and through Mexico be stopped by the immediate occupation of the valley of the Rio Grande, that ""the object proposed can be best accomplished by getting possession of the Mississippi river, and in this way separating Texas from the rebel states east of the Mississippi river."" A General so destitute of sense as to give such an opinion ought for the good of his country to die as soon as possible, and after death should be buried in the big ditch he dug at Shiloh or Corinth. That ditch would form for him an appropriate monument.
Enclosed I send you a review of Banks' address, written by myself, together with two or three other scraps which may
amuse you. Let me hear from you. Anything for me addressed to the care of John Austin Stevens, Esq., will be received, and will be preserved for me in case I should be temporarily absent from his house in which I am now a guest. I remain,

Lt. Wm. H. Wiegel
My Dear Wiegel: I have your letter of the 22nd. I had the one previously, but I was so situated at that time as to be unable to take any action upon the subject which it contained. That has since passed by, and I am now at liberty to take such action as I choose upon your application.
I have but one difficulty in recommending you for the post you seek, and that is contained by these words in your letter, which are, ""I have been asked to tell what I knew of affairs in New Orleans; but they may imprison me for contempt before I would say one word against any one who had been a friend to me.""
Now this would seem like a threat, and were it not the accompanying words of friendship and devotion, I should take it so. But as I know there is nothing that you could say of me which I need fear to have said, I am not disposed so to regard it.
I do therefore enclose this letter of recommendation; but upon the express condition that you shall at any and all times say anything that is true concerning any act of mine, during the time you were with me.
You say you do not know why I withdrew my confidence from you. You do know the acts which made it necessary to have you hand me your resignation upon my staff. I was most sorry for that resignation, because of the necessity which caused it. Still, those acts were not of a kind to impair confidence in any degree in your integrity.
I will now tell you why I withdrew confidence from you. I was informed that you had used similar expressions to those in your note just quoted. If you had treasured up anything while on my staff to my injury, without informing me, I could not have you with me. If you had not, and used these words
as giving a means of revenge for the loss of your position, -- in either case I could not give you a position near me.
You will remember I took you for your services to the cause; gave you, for a young man, high and honorable position; loved you, because, perhaps, of that very roughness which made you distasteful to others, and, as you say, gave you my confidence. I have never known any breach of it. I can therefore recommend you for a new position, but be careful that you justify that recommendation.
You can do good service to the country if you will; but beware of the ""besetting sin,"" and if in your new duties you shall do well, or if in the future you shall deserve my approbation, you may be assured you will always find a friend with a helping hand in,

Committee of Citizens
Gentlemen: The necessities of my position have rendered it exceedingly inconvenient for me earlier to reply to your exquisitely courteous and too kind token of approval of my administration in the command of the Department of the Gulf, asking me to fix a day when I could meet you as therein proposed.
With every expression of profound gratitude for your invitation to partake of a public dinner with the citizens of New York, allow me to suggest that, while I am waiting orders to
join my brave comrades in the field, it would not be consonant with my duties to accept your too flattering hospitalities.
To you, gentlemen, at home, bearing your share of the burdens and expenses of this unholy war, forced upon us by treason, the tendering of such an expression of approbation of the conduct of a public officer was fit and proper, as it was natural and customary, but my acceptance of it would trench upon a different feeling. I too well know the revulsion of feeling with which the soldier in the field, and occupying the trenches, or pacing the sentinel's weary path in the blazing heat, or watching from his cold bivouac for the stars, shut out by the drenching cloud, hears of feasting and merry-making at home by those who ought to bear his hardships with him, and the bitterness with which he speaks of those who thus engaged are wearing his uniform.
Upon the scorching sand and under the brain-trying sun of the Gulf coast, I have shared too much that feeling to add one pang, however slight, to the discontent which my fellow-soldiers suffer doing the duties of the camp and field, by my own act. now, while momentarily separated from them by the exigencies of the public service.
You will pardon, I am sure, this apparent rudeness of refusal of your most generous proposal; but under such circumstances I have spoken too bitterly and too often of the participation by absent officers in such occasions to permit myself to take part in one, even when offered in the patriotic spirit which breathes through your letter, desiring to testify approval of my services to the country.
It would, however, give me much pleasure to testify my gratitude for your kindness by meeting you, and your fellow-citizens in a less formal manner, interchanging the patriotic sympathies and hopes which belong to this sacred cause. Perhaps by so doing we may do something in aid of that cause. Whatever may strengthen the purpose, deepen the resolution, and fix the determination never to yield the contest until the rebellion in its root and branch, its seeds and causes, in its effects and designs, is overthrown and utterly annihilated forever, and the Government, with its Democratizing influences and traditional theories of equality of rights, equality of laws, and equality of privileges for all, as received from the Fathers of the Republic is actively acknowledged upon every inch of the United States territory, is an aid, nay a necessity, to the cause of the country, to prepare the public mind in its doubts
or fears, or suggestions of compromise or hopes of peace; to be satisfied with anything less than these demands is treason to country, humanity, and God, more foul because more cowardly than rebellion in arms.
Let every loyal man join hands with his neighbor, scouting all differences of political opinion, which must be minor to this paramount interest, and pledge himself to the fullest support of the Government with men and means to crush out this treason, and then, and not till then, am I willing to hear anything of political party.
Again and again returning you my grateful thanks for the courtesy done me by your action, allow me to say that I shall be in New York during the coming week, and shall be happy at any time to meet you, gentlemen, and my fellow-citizens, in such manner as you may think fitting.
Most respectfully, Your obedient servant,

Rev. Baron Stow
My dear Sir: I hasten to answer your note on the day of its reception. Though personally unknown to you, I was taught to know and reverence you almost thirty years ago by my pastor, teacher, friend, Rev. Enoch W. Freeman. Nothing could give me greater pleasure than to do anything consistent with public duty to do you a favor. You yourself shall judge Laurason's case as I remember the facts.
Laurason came from Europe, where, I have been told, he was in the Confederate or State Service in the purchase of arms (but of this I have no sufficient evidence), sometime in the winter of 1861; February, I think, and then took active part in behalf of the rebellion.
He was a member of the Committee of Public Safety, which spent more than a million dollars, mostly charitable funds, left by McDonough and Fintre to the poor and orphans of New Orleans, and filched from them for the purpose of fortifying New Orleans against the United States. But this was not ""the head and front of his offending, it had this extent -- and more.""
There was an association in New Orleans known as the ""Southern independent rights association,"" its members bound together by horrid oaths to resist unto death all and every attempt to have Louisiana come back (into the Union). The business of this association was to act as a sort of vigilance committee to hunt out Union men; to drive them away by violence: to confiscate their property, and to hang them if they did not at once obey their behests.
They were also, by the terms of these articles of agreement, to exercise a careful supervision over the officials of the Confederate States, and see to it that they in no degree were too merciful or remiss in their duty in punishing those who were friendly to the Union. This body sat in secret, acted in secret committees in defiance of the laws of the Confederacy even, and arrested, punished, and destroyed whomsoever was denounced to them. Of this gang Soulé was a prominent member, and Laurason was Secretary, and after New Orleans was captured Laurason burnt the records of the association, so that their doings need not be known to the United States authorities. For this, amongst other things, I imprisoned Laurason, -- ought he to be discharged? If you, a loyal gentleman, think so, I will defer to your judgment and recommend his discharge.
With many grateful thanks for your kind appreciation of my endeavors in the service of the country, believe me,
Most Truly Yours"

Belvidere (Lowell), April 27th, 1863 Rev. Baron Stow
Dear Sir: You can make any disposition you may think best of my letter stating the facts in Laurason's case. He is no worse or better than many hundred others of equal intelligence who are doing almost the same, certainly like things, with himself, and the Government permits them to go unpunished.
For the late Rev. Mr. Freeman I have the most undiminished love and respect. For two years he was a member of my mother's family; my only sister was baptized by him as a member of his church; by his influence I became a student at Waterville College instead of a pupil of West Point. If he had faults of character I never knew them, to me he was in place of father at the age when fatherless boys need one. I
was accustomed, therefore, to love those he loved, and to be guided by him in all things until his untimely death, which, taking place at the close of my first collegiate year, had a marked effect on my future, which then was a hope on his part that I should follow his footsteps whether for good or evil time can alone determine.
Pardon me these details, but they are calling back the memory of one very dear to me, and one who held you very dear, and taught me to regard you as his friend.
I thank you for your kind allusion to the speech, would it were worthier. If it shall aid in bringing the country to look upon this rebellion as the thing it is, it will have done all that might be asked.

My dear General: I take the liberty to suggest the conservative importance of having your powerful address put into circulation, in pamphlet form, that the intelligent readers of our community may have an opportunity to peruse, with careful deliberation, the cogent and logically statesmanlike views you have presented, with such great force, as a vade mecum for public consideration.
In your instructive demonstration, you have exhibited the reliable elements of a national platform, for the review of the past and the basis of a judicious comprehension of the entanglements of our present condition, while you have demonstrated the necessity of an united and energetic action as essential to command and to direct the imposing exigencies of approaching portentous events.
In your illustration of the very delicate problem of the future, you have cleared away many of the dark clouds which have, heretofore, shrouded the prospect of a successful termination of our difficulties, in almost inextricable embarrassment. The position you have assumed is full of manliness, loyalty, and conservative wisdom, presenting to the reflecting people of the South, as well as the patriotic population of the North, the strongest argumentative inducements for the necessity and absolute importance of giving to the government our fullest confidence and unlimited support.
The project you have proposed for an harmonious re-construction
of the Union, by counter state revolutions, is not only perfectly practicable but is of easy execution, and through it we may entertain reasonable hopes that your federal anticipations may be soon realized. If the painful experience of the past has not taught to the South the sad lesson that they are contending in a cause of sheer desperation, totally and entirely inconsistent with their best and permanent interests, their situation is most deplorable, being merely a melancholy effort to keep up a rebellious government, a miserable combination of political aspirants who have wantonly usurped power, through false issues and representations, for the enjoyment of selfish monopolies arising out of despotic abuses.
The time may not be far distant, when, through a proper sense of their forlorn condition, the people and the military spirit of the South may rouse to the necessity of throwing off all allegiance to the confederate rulers, and then, through state revolutions, seek to become honorable, equal members of the federal organization, subject, of course, to the very afflicting changes incident to the insane war of secession.
There is, nevertheless, an absolute necessity, if we desire to entertain and promote the faithful consummation of any such happy event, that the Northern public, without distinction of party, should show itself truly and energetically united, that the South may have confidence in the prospect of the future, and that foreign selfishness, hypocrisy, and duplicity may contemplate, through the vista of the drama, that the vitality, energy, and indomitable enterprise of the United States cannot be imposed upon, nor insulted, with impunity.
In connection with the re-publication of your address, the complimentary introductory remarks of the Mayor should be given, as an able, judicious, honorable demonstration of the honest, patriotic feeling of our municipal community.

I saw Gen. Banks before writing the enclosed, and asked his permission to answer the attack, to which he replied he had no objection.
Enclosure referred to in Foregoing Letter
Baton Rouge, March 31st, 1863
Sir: In the New York World of the 11th instant an article appears attacking Major General Butler, and making charges against Gov. Shepley and Col. French. As my name appears in it, and it there said I knew of the truth of the allegations, it is due to myself that I should notice it. Having served under General Butler in two different departments since the commencement of the war, and having had opportunities of knowing him, I cannot allow so infamous an article to stand unanswered.
In August last, the time mentioned, I was Deputy Provost Marshal of New Orleans, acting independent of the Provost Marshal, taking my orders from and reporting to the Major General.
One of my specials having reported to me that there were suspicious movements of schooners, and that he believed improper passes were issued and contraband goods passed out of the lines, as was my duty I reported it to the General -- without a moment's hesitation he directed me to see to the matter, and gave me an order, with plenary power, to search and detain all vessels suspected, whether they had a pass from himself or any one else, and to bring before him any one, no matter who, who was found engaged in any contraband trade directly or indirectly, and if any officers were found favoring such movements they would be severely dealt with. Under that order I set detectives at work including my informant, but failed after most diligent efforts to find any truth in the statements. I never knew of any goods going across the lines to the rebels, or of any contraband trade going on, or that Col. Butler, Col. French, or any other official were engaged in any such transactions.
Had I known of such things and failed to put a stop to them I would have been derelict in my duty, or proved myself too weak to be entrusted with the position I held. The article says ""I (the informant) attempted to send documents to Washington by order of Col. Stafford, with all these facts, which papers were intercepted by General Butler, and those parties who gave the information were imprisoned."" Now this is false. I never ordered anyone to send documents of any kind to Washington. A person who was confined in the Parish Prison while I was sheriff prepared some communications,
one to his father and the other to an influential friend, for the purpose of procuring his pardon from the President, and desired, if he could not be released without, that a special agent should be sent on from Washington to investigate his case, and at the same time inquire into certain allegations of corruption which he made against Col. French. Seeing nothing in this at the time except an effort on the part of a prisoner to effect his release by recriminating upon others, I forwarded the letters. They were not intercepted, but reached the parties addressed by due course of mail, nor was any attempt made to prevent their transit, to my knowledge. I was inquired of by Gen. Butler in the presence of Gov. Shepley as to those letters, he having been informed that they contained grave charges which ought to be investigated, and reproved me for not bringing such charges to his notice that the proper action might be taken, stating that it was due to himself and Gov. Shepley, who had just promoted Col. French, that charges of such a character should not stand against one of his officers untried. An investigation was then instituted by Gen. Butler, in which I took no part, my duties being at the time quite onerous, as I was preparing to leave the city in command of my regiment, and shortly afterwards I took the field, returning to New Orleans only occasionally on business.
In all my intercourse with Gen. Butler, which in my position, was to a great extent . . . .

Lochiel, Pennsylvania, April 23rd, 1863
My dear General: I have delayed writing to you a long while in the expectation of meeting you somewhere, so that I might more fully express my thoughts and feelings.
No explanation has ever been made to me of your sudden, and to the world, unexpected recall from New Orleans, in the midst of your usefulness and after your unprecedented labor and successes. I believed for a long time that you were to be offered the War Department or the command of the army of the Potomac -- for I never dreamed that your services were to be lost to the country -- when everybody believed you to be the only man in arms who had been equal to the position in which Providence had placed him.
It seems that you, like a very few others, were so much in advance of your following as to be equal to the wants of your country. This is your misfortune, but you are young enough to make all men sing your praise for it, and wish they had believed in your coming at the right time.
I live here quietly, within 2 miles of Harrisburg -- on the direct route from New York to Washington -- whose cars start every morning and evening from Jersey City. Can't you stop with me sometime soon? Or will I have to go to Boston or New York to see you? The better way would be for you and Mrs. Butler to come here, and we will leave the ladies together while you and I spend a week in our coal region. Fix your own time.
Your friend, truly, Simon Cameron

"April 27, 1863","From General Butler
Lowell, April 27th, 1863
Hon. S. P. Chase, Secretary of the Treasury
My dear Sir: I have delayed thanking you for your very complimentary letter, because I had hopes of meeting you, as the newspapers alleged you were coming to New England. I am glad you like the speech. It was an attempt on my part to demonstrate that I had acted upon a theory during the war, and not from caprice with a ""change of base"" upon every change of circumstance. By giving the steps by which my own mind was led to its several conclusions, I hoped that the minds of others might thereby find ""stepping stones"" for change of political ideas -- always difficult to those of fixedness of purpose and solidity of character.
It grieves me to think you should misunderstand me so much. You say ""you will not argue with me,"" as you are not accustomed to do so with men of my mould. My dear sir, no man can be more easily and surely influenced by argument from a friend than myself. I may be differently affected by the representations of enemies. If you knew how much I stand alone in the land you would at least give me your sympathy. All past political associations broken up, no new ones formed; idle at home, no prospect of serving my country in the cause to be useful to which I had given up everything; eating unearned bread which I have never done before; asked a hundred times a day, ""when are you going into service?"" or ""why are you unemployed?"", until I have almost isolated myself from my friends and neighbors to avoid the annoying questions; disgraced in the eyes of the country and especially in the eyes of foreign nations by the action of my Government, and all this too with not the poor relief of uttering a single word of explanation or complaint because I will not by act of mine embarrass the Government in this contest by a shadow's weight -- all are hardly to be born with patience by one who is not overstocked with that good gift, as you may have heard.
I have thought of resigning my commission. It prevents my earning anything for myself and is useless to the country,
but I have forborne so to do because I am flattered to believe myself of consequence enough to make such a step a source of exultation to the enemies of the country. I have therefore refrained, and allowed it to be understood by such people as have chosen so to understand it that I was withdrawn from the Gulf by my own consent, and am now at home of my own motives, but consistently with self-respect it is of grave consideration how I can retain it much longer in this manner.
But, say you, why treat me to a list of your supposed grievances? Simply because you allow me to speak in confidence and friendship, and so must bear the burden you have undertaken, until wearied you shall shake it off. It is so pleasing sometimes ‘o relieve oneself where one hopes for sympathy, besides --
""The flesh will quiver where the pincers tear,
The blood will follow where the knife is driven.""
Specially, however, to show you how much my situation and feelings, did I allow them to overbalance my matured judgment, urge upon me the acceptance of the command at New Orleans. Pride, personal gratification, triumph over my smaller adversaries here and there, and vindication to the world (if the world cares a copper about the matter), all press me not only to accept but apply for that command. Your advice and wish are added. Nothing but the firmest convictions could make me withstand such pressure.
The campaign is substantially over in the Southwest if no more troops are to be sent there. True, Banks is marching into the Opelousas Country with 25000 men, doing that precisely and no more than Weitzel did last October with 4000, but cui bono, so far as Port Hudson is concerned? Except to do, after frittering away the four winter months, the same thing which was reported to General-in-Chief in October last as desirable to be done, the only answer to which was recall and an immediate attack ordered to be made on Port Hudson, which however has never come within seven miles of being made.
The nine months' men are about to come home. They have mutinied and burned Pensacola, and refused to serve with colored troops, who are superiors in discipline to some of them.
I am not blaming Banks. I have no right to criticise my superiors who have sent him there, and are now conducting
the campaign, and mark me! I do not do it, but I suppose I may state, if I cannot help make, historical facts.
I have one comfort left me. I am a young man. With fair play, I have twenty good years in my constitution yet, and during that time I will not forget the men who deserve to be remembered. I do not understand our plan of carrying on war, although I have never written a treatise on either the laws of nations or the art of war in any of its branches, for what education I have has been by reading a few good books, not by writing poor ones, still I may venture to assert that I cannot see the use of five or six little armies who never cooperate with each other -- considerably too large for garrisons and quite too small for armies -- too little to move -- too large to lie still; enough to swallow up men, less than needed for effective action; too large to afford to lose them as garrisons of posts, which by the rules of war are supposed to be captured after their resistance has cost the enemy enough for the outlay, and yet so small as to keep us in constant trepidation lest they be overpowered.
We have an army too large for a garrison at Fortress Monroe (1), another at Suffolk (2), another at Williamsburg (3), another at Newbern (4), another at Hilton Head (5), another (much too large but not large enough) at New Orleans (6), amounting in all say to 75,000 men, besides leaving garrisons at all those places -- sufficient within the definition I have given of the use of a garrison. I do not object to expeditionary corps, far from it -- what I do object to is that we never get through with an expedition. Now the expedition to Port Royal was well enough, but why not get through with that expedition, garrison the place if thought best, and come away? The expedition to Newbern was well enough, but why not garrison the place or destroy it and come back? The expedition to Suffolk was for some good purpose doubtless -- but why not come away now? Why stay at Williamsburg except for the purpose of feeding the insane men and idiots of the South who are not in the army? For what purpose are all these troops scattered about? Why keep us constantly in hot water lest either at Blackwater, Coldwater, Newbern, or Hilton Head we should have an expeditionary army crushed by a concentration of rebel forces acting on an interior line? Why have more than one Washington to defend? Is not one enough? Are we not frightened enough and often enough about that one? Has it not cost us enough without attempting to hold
Washington, N. C. What are we there for? If to cut railroad communications, send forces enough to do it, and then come back. Is it to prevent smuggling? Holding Hatteras and Fort Macon, we hold the whole North Carolina coast save Wilmington, which somehow we cannot blockade. Are all these detached armies to give a chance for the Union men at the South to rise? Have we not got over that absurd idea yet? Specially when we make these very armies so small that the few (very few) Union men who can be found are quaking with fear lest the Union Armies should be overcome, and they given over to the tender mercies of their Southern brethren. I suppose that for 18 months we have kept from 15 to 18,000 men at Hilton Head for the purpose of affording a refuge to the Union men of South Carolina to revolutionize the state. Would one not rather make a masked ball out of ""Angel's visits"" than such an attempt, and yet what else have we been doing there? We never have had men enough there for an attack either upon Savannah or Charleston, and five thousand would have sufficed for a garrison with the fleet in the harbour. Why have 10,000 men stood there idle for 18 months? Send out expeditions, take places, garrison them or destroy them. Let the men come back to go again unless, as in case of New Orleans, you mean to make the place a base of operations, and if so send an army made up out of these surplus garrisons, if you have no other of strength sufficient, make its campaign, defeat or be defeated -- do something and get through.
Let me illustrate what I mean. Make up an army from the surplus men at Fortress Monroe, Suffolk, Norfolk, Newbern, Hilton Head, and New Orleans. Concentrate them on Port Hudson, take it, if men can do it, or let it alone. Get your men on board transports -- go to Mobile, take it if you can. Garrison it or destroy it. Go to Charleston with men enough to coöperate with the Navy and to take that or let it alone. You will then have an army mobilized (I mean no pun on the word Mobile), which can go somewhere and do something. Indeed, if one of your garrisoned posts like Newbern or Hilton Head was besieged, you have a moving and moveable concentrated force that you can at once send to its relief and punish the enemy.
Such an army accustomed to move, to embark and disembark, men finding their places at once on board transports to which they were accustomed, would hang like a black cloud
over the Southern horizon. Learned to know each other and their officers, divested by their very movements of all surplus luggage, carrying their provisions and ammunition with them without difficulty, striking a series of effective expeditionary blows as this war has not seen, their operations conducted with celerity and secrecy because of this mobility, a perpetual threat to every place to be reached by water, going from point to point with resistless power, as far as the garrisons of southern cities were concerned, -- and wherever it went would and should be power and terror. With an accompanying fleet both under one head -- there would be need of but small garrisons in the Southern cities held by us. Any force strong enough to prevent a coup de main would be sufficient. Indeed, such an army would be ready to relieve Washington if by disaster it found itself besieged, capable of being brought there with more celerity via the Potomac or Annapolis than a rebel army could be marched thither from Richmond. Alas! I have dreamed of such an army, but I suppose it is not to be.
Now, before we strike a blow by an expeditionary corps, months of preparation of men, hurried chartering of insecure transports, provisions for civil government of the places to be taken, commissions and the civil officers copied by rascally clerks, orders to transport captains, confidential communications to foreign agents secretly in the interest of secession -- all tell the rebels, trumpet-tongued, the destination of the expedition, so that preparations can be made to worst it, and generally successfully, except perhaps in the case of the last expedition to New Orleans, which I believe was taken by Banks without difficulty, notwithstanding his destination was known to Davis weeks before it started.
Under our present plan, if we should capture Richmond, Savannah, Charleston, and Mobile, we should have no soldiers east of the mountains at all except frittered away in the attempt to hold these places and their surroundings. Concentrate an army for expeditions. Concentrate armies to march on given points -- not more than three in all, but let them be overwhelming. Above all, let us have one pitched battle in this war. This will be War. Have you thought upon this fact that neither side has yet risked or offered a general engagement? All the contests have been intended only as movements upon isolated positions or divisions of the opposing army, but in which the whole force has not been engaged or intended to be engaged by the attacking party.
I do not except Shiloh or Antietam. The first Bull Run came nearer to a general engagement in intention than any other, and yet that by the plan was to be and by the execution still more was only a partial engagement. In what War save this did ""Reserves"" mean a force not to be brought into action on the same day with the aggressive corps? Does the word not now rather mean Preserves? Did not Napoleon send all his reserves into action as soon as the fight showed where they could be best employed, either to aid or sustain the attack? I forget the name of the battle, but remember the fact that with some 100,000 men engaged, he said to one of his marshals as the last corps d'armée went into action, ""Husband your men! I have but two regiments of the Old Guard left.""
Perhaps the disappointment of the country at the Bull Run defeat has determined the course of our battles, but so is the fact. We have risked nothing, and we have gained nothing but delays. Nothing was ever greatly gained without something was greatly risked.
It is well for the Rebels to decline an engagement in which all is staked. A general engagement lost and the victory followed up being destructive to them, but for us, who could not have been harmed save in pride or in the damage to the reputation of some general more quickly ""than by slow decay,"" is it not wonderful that we have not offered a general engagement?
A millionaire may risk a hundred thousand dollars on a throw of a die, where a man who had only three would be mad so to do.
You will be glad, I doubt not, that I do not write oftener, since when I do write I am so tedious -- but Dogberry says, ""were I twice as tedious as I am I could bestow it all on your highness""; but I write this for you alone, and therefore I have spoken with a freedom which would not be justified otherwise.
Permit me to congratulate you upon the eminent success which has attended the finances of the Government under your administration. It is admirable; but was it greatly won without the courage greatly to risk a failure? Believe me,
Most truly Yours, (Benj. F. Butler)"

General: With reference to the question of precedence of rank in which yourself and General Dix and Banks are concerned, which was brought up by you some weeks since in conversation at the War Department, I am directed by the Secretary of War to request you to submit, in form, the point made, with such remarks as may seem proper to you, at your earliest convenience. The army register is now in course of preparation, and its publication will be delayed until this question of rank can be settled.

"May 1, 1863","From General Butler
Lowell, May 1st, 1863
Hon. Edwin M. Stanton, Sec'y. of War
Sir: I have the honor to restate in writing the points of fact of law, and of form, which were stated to you personally in presence of the President, by force of which I claim to be Senior Maj. General of the active list in the service of the United States.
The conclusions deduced from them were assented to by you, and you determined that, if the facts and dates were found to be correctly stated, I should have in the ""Official Register"" the place to which my actual rank entitles me.
You will do me the favor to remember that the apology then given for not earlier claiming my right, ""that I had always been serving alone on the frontier line of the rebellion, and
therefore questions of seniority of rank did not become of importance,"" was deemed sufficient. It was further added that there never had seemed to me time to contend about personal rights, while actively engaged in establishing National ones.
The only Major Generals whose rank can be possibly in collision of seniority with mine are Generals McClellan, of the United States Army, whose letter of appointment directs ""he shall rank as such from the 14th of May 1861; General Fremont, of the U. S. Army, taking rank by the same words of his letter of appointment May 14th, 1861; General Banks, U. S. Vols., taking rank May 16th, 1861, and General Dix, U. S. Vols., taking rank May 16th, 1861, both by like words in their letter of appointment.
Each of the Officers was appointed long after the date which they may claim rank from the words of their letters of appointment. That is to say: General Banks, appointed June 5th, 1861; General Dix, appointed June 14th, 1861; General McClellan, appointed July 24th, 1861; General Fremont, appointed July 24th, 1861. Neither of the officers could of course accept their appointment or take the oath of office until after its date. I received my letter of appointment on the 16th day of May, 1861, the letter being dated that day giving me rank as of that day.
My acceptance of the appointment & oath of office was on the 18th of May, 1861, and I was assigned to the command of the Department of South Eastern Virginia on the 20th of May, and actually took command on the 22nd of May, 1861.
All these dates and facts appear on the records of the War Department. So that it will appear that I was appointed Maj. General of Volunteers, and actually in the service of the United States in command of a Department two weeks before any letter of appointment issued to any other Major General of the U. S. Army of Volunteers, and more than two months before any Maj. Gen'l. of the U. S. Army was appointed after the rebellion.
My Commission was given me, as I was most kindly informed by the President, in consideration of meritorious services performed in the service of the United States, in command of the Dept. of Annapolis, to which I was assigned April 27th, 1861, by Gen'l Orders from the War Department. Orders No. (12) of the Series 1861. At this time Generals McClellan and Banks were drawing their salaries as Officers
in their respective Rail Roads. Gen'l Dix was attending to his private avocations at home, and General Fremont was taking care of his personal interest in Europe. Therefore, you will do me the favor to recall to mind that when you suggested in the presence of the President, that it was to be inferred that by giving Generals McClellan and Fremont appointments on the 24th of July, 1861, to take rank May 14th, two days before the actual date of my appointment May 16th, the President must have intended to give them seniority of rank, I answered with some warmth that if the President, after giving me my Commission on the 16th of May with so many flattering commendations for having won it in the field, more than two months after intended to give others seniority of rank over me, I would at once settle all questions of rank by resigning a Commission thus disgraced, and appealed to the President to say if such was his intention. The President thereupon replied, with his accustomed sincerity and straightforward integrity both of word and action, that he had no such intention, and that indeed he knew nothing of these dates, save that he did know that ""he gave me my Commission the first of anybody.""
There is no regulation of the Army which precisely covers this case. The 5th paragraph of the Regulations of 1857, which were those in force when these appointments were made, would hardly seem to cover it. That enacts ""when Commissions are of the same date the rank is to be decided between Officers of the same Regiment or Corps by the Order of Appointment."" All the Maj. Gen'ls. must be of the same Corps if such term can be applied, and if so then the Order of Appointment settles conclusively the point in my favor. The same paragraph further enacts ""between Officers of a different regiment or Corps. 1st. by rank in actual service when appointed""; if so, that settles the point in my favor, because I held rank as Brig. Gen'l. in the actual service of the U. S. in command of a military Department when appointed. Secondly, by former rank in the Army or marine Corps. Thirdly, by lottery among such as have been in the military Service of the United States. But these provisions are only applicable to the cases of Generals Banks and Dix, whose appointments give them rank at the same day, May 16th.
As between Generals Dix, Banks, and myself, however, the matter is conclusively settled by Order No. 66 of the series of 1861, which provides that ""The commissioned Officers of all
Vols. organizations, no matter whether established under the authority of a state or of the U. S., will be regarded as having been commissioned on the day when mustered into service of the United States, and will take rank in their respective grades; will be entitled to pay and be obeyed and respected in their several positions from that date."" I was mustered into the service of the United States more than twenty days before any other General now in the active service of the United States.
As the advice and consent of the Senate is only a confirmation of the appointment by the President, of course the action of that advisory body does not affect the ""Order of appointment"" or the date from which seniority is to be reckoned.
The effect of the muster into the Volunteer Service of the United States, upon questions of precedence in rank of Officers as above claimed, was settled by the action of the War Dept. in the case of Col. Birge, 13th Regt. Conn. Vols., submitted by myself from Dept. of the Gulf by letter dated October, 1862, to which and the answer of the Department, settling the rights of Col. Birge, I beg leave to refer as entirely decisive of the matter in the Volunteer service.
Now, as by the several acts of Congress and the General Orders and regulations of the War Department, the rank of the Officers in the Army and Volunteers are put upon precisely the same footing, save in one particular, when their Commissions are of the same date, and they are serving in the same corps or at the same Post, and as I have shown that my letter of appointment, which is de facto the Commission when consented to and advised by the Senate, is senior by two months, how can it be that Gen'l. McClellan and Fremont, not appointed till more than two months afterwards, can take precedence in seniority of rank to me?
The President has power to do many things, but it has been said that even ""an act of parliament could not make one's uncle his aunt."" How then can the President make a junior officer a senior officer in the same grade? I grant that the President can put the junior in command of the senior, but it took an act of Congress to enable the President to do that. But there is no act of Congress which has or can settle seniority of rank otherwise than as the Almanac, taking note of the lapse of time, has settled it.
As questions of seniority now are only useful in points of etiquette, and service upon Court Martials, this discussion is relieved of much of its individual consequence, but as a right
won in the service of the Country, an honor to be prized, I know you will commend me if I insist with pertinacious firmness upon its complete acknowledgment. I have the honor to be,

My dear General: I have just received the package containing your letter of April 27th, the slip of questions, the letter of Harper and Butler's, and a copy of the speech.
The speech is the speech of an honest man and faithful servant. I have read it with pleasure and instruction. It is highly interesting to me to learn how these things looked to a Democrat in the year 1860. So exclusively had I consorted with people of opposite opinions, that you and Major Bell are almost the only democrats of recent times with whom I ever conversed five minutes.
With regard to the Messrs Harper's letter: It has been taken for granted that the book is to be published by the Mason Brothers, to whom I first communicated the project, and who have from the first encouraged it. They can do as well with it as anybody and I am peculiarly bound to do all I can for their interests, as they have ever done for mine. They were original Butler men: you have no where warmer friends than they.
A Jew in military buttons, speaking English with a German accent, presented himself in my town the other morning. He has been your clerk, and has now left you in search of better employment in Washington. He says that on his arrival here he was met in the street by a partisan of the virtuous Ben Wood, and taken by him to Ben Wood, and to the World office, and that efforts were made to pump him to your injury; which, as he says, he resisted with the virtue of a Roman; but, at the same time, insinuated to me that he ""could and he would.""
My impression was that he is not an ornament to his sex, and that his virtue was not of the best pattern. I fear you have been too good to him. Bear in mind, however, that these are mere impressions: he said nothing very improper, and I would not do a poor devil an injury. I was once a poor devil myself. I have a feeling for that persuasion. I mention the incident only for the Ben Wood part of the story.
""If I look into the Delta!"" As if one column of it could escape me! No, Sir. It is immensely interesting.

The head of the state wags at ease as usual. The judicial head, Secretary Seward's provisional court, takes care that

What courage can we have when an army officer can publicly tear up the American flag and go unhung, and for aught that appears, unrebuked?

Dear General: I have yours of the 12th. Mr. W. is expected here to-day. If he arrives, I will telegraph, ""He is here.""
Mr. Stanton desires to displace General Hooker and appoint General Heintsleman to command on the Potomac and Rappahannock. General Halleck desires the command. Everybody desires to have Mr. Stanton superseded.
All the newspaper talk of early advance or offensive action on the part of General Hooker, is either an impudent mendacity or stupid credulity. The army is greatly reduced by the late campaign, and by the discharge of two years and nine months' regiments. It requires time to remount the artillery, and to supply arms and parts of arms, thrown away by the retreating infantry in vast quantities.
Possibly, General Lee may conclude to stand on a shorter radius and inner circle somewhere between Fredericksburg and Richmond, but it is equally possible that he may assume the offensive.
In that, the attitude here is at present expectant only, with great confusion of counsels at Headquarters.
I think G. and H. would be fit persons to see W.
Yours, C. Cushing"

Legation of the United States, Copenhagen, May 20th, 1863
Dear Sir: I am under obligations to yourself, and some one else, for your admirable speech in New York. I endorse it most fully, and I cannot understand why it is that you, who so fully reflect the opinion of all loyal Americans, and who have vindicated your ability to command, are not in command. I am glad to find my own views in respect to the Constitution sustained by you. In March last, I wrote the very gentleman who introduced you to the Mayor, at the meetings, to the effect that before this war we could go no farther than the Constitution permitted, and that was to exclude slavery from the territories, prevent the forming of any more slave states, making freedom national and slavery sectional, and that this and its abolition in all other parts of the national domain was about all the Constitution then permitted. But when the South rebelled: and as far as they were concerned, abrogated the Constitution, forfeiting all rights under it, the Republican principle of abolition obtained jurisdiction over the slaves of every rebel and over every rebel slave state. This to me seemed very plain. I could not before the rebellion be actively an abolitionist in a free state, whatever I might be in a slave state! for the Constitution inhibited it. But I could be, and was, a Free Soiler. Since the rebellion, the Constitution and all our traditions not only permitted, but as I think enjoined abolition against every disloyal slaveholder and every disloyal slave state, and had it been strictly enforced there never would have been so much disloyalty at the North. Such was the substance of my views on that subject. Rumor says I am recalled; for what I know not, nor is it of much consequence. It is enough that I can, I think, do some little in the future to inaugurate a Government that will reflect the opinions of the loyal, honest, and true men in our country.
If I mistake not the signs of the times, men's minds are now being turned that way, and it behooves all to see that they are not cheated by politicians, by trade and political rogues. You will see by this that I was a Freesoiler, and a democrat. As a member of the loyal Congress, I understood the whole Texas swindle and went for the Wilmot proviso, and I know that the South used the Northern democracy to control public opinion in Europe in their favor. Nearly all
the foreign missions were filled, either with Southern men or men with Southern principles. The bare suspicion that my friend, Gen. Dix, was unsound to the South, or that he would act independently, twice shut him out from a foreign mission. With my renewed thanks for your speech, I remain,

heard of such an one, and there were no facilities at the Fortress for taking such a photograph.
I have been informed and believe that Col. Wardrop has recovered his sword. And while I make no doubt that the Col., whom I know very well, would be glad of any token from the relatives of his deceased friend, I think there is no occasion on your part to suppose that he has suffered any loss.
The commendations you are pleased to express upon my services in the cause for which you and yours have sacrificed so much are very dear to me.
I had learned to love Theodore's brave and gentle nature; to be inspired with his enthusiastic love of country; and to think with him upon the causes of our troubles, and if in any degree my endeavors have come up to the high standard of his thoughts, I am indeed fortunate.
Pray never again for a moment think it an intrusion to write me. I lost my sister as I left college, and her correspondence which was the guide of my early life.

Seward arrived in New York last evening, this morning the Herald comes out for Banks for Sec. of War, and the Times squints that way. This is Seward's work. Those papers were friendly to you, but by some oversight they have been allowed to drift away into the interest of Seward's faction. The article in the Herald should be answered by a leader in some other New York paper, something like this, ""Who shall be Stanton's successor, Butler, Banks, McClellan, etc., are mentioned. Let us see what each has done to warrant their appointment."" Then pitch in and show what you have done and what each of the others have done, then wind up by saying that Butler is the only one. Bell and Clark should be kept at this kind of work, and a couple of New York papers got into our interest. An article might also appear showing that Seward is running Banks. In short, some judicious man must take hold of the newspapers. In haste,
Your friend, J. W. Shaffer

My dear General: Clark and Turner have started for the East. I will remain here for some days and see how things
look. There are two interests here, both for you. 1st., those that hate Stanton, -- they want you for the purpose of getting Stanton out; this class is Chase, Blair, Bates, and most of the outsiders. 2nd class, is those that desires to make you the coming man, Chandler, Wade, Carter, etc., lead this class; they are in favor of getting you West for two reasons, 1st, because they say they want you to be associated with and make reputation among Western men, as they will have the control to a great extent of future operations (not military). 2nd. these men are not yet ready to fight Station. I believe this is the way your friends stand. Judge Carter to-day told me that he was asking that there be made a big department with Hd. Q. at St. Louis. with a view of giving you control of all the Mississippi Valley, and that Stanton was extremely anxious that it should be done, in fact he (Stanton) was doing all he could for it, but that the President wanted time to consider. Now my conviction is, that did not Mr. Lincoln expect and want you here he would have yielded at once to above plan. He told a friend of mine to-day that he was waiting to get a place big enough for you, that he could put you in it. I have arranged for an interview with him to-morrow, and will let you know the result. I told Clark the result of my interview with Cameron, and what he agreed to have done. I also told him exactly how Seward stood, and what is necessary to put that right. My information in regard to Weed and Seward comes mostly from Whitely of the Herald, he is certainly devoted to your interests, and is well posted. Whitely says Mr. Lincoln wants you for Sec. of War, and that Seward objects only on the ground of foreign relations, and that if proper means are used Seward can be persuaded to withdraw his objections, etc. Now, I don't state this as my opinion, but as the opinion of those who appear to be your friends here. I have to be very prudent to prevent the impression that I am here by authority, and I tell all hands that I have not any other than the common interests of the country to serve.
I feel deeply the necessity of what I wrote you the other day being cared for. I will not be able to get to Chicago in time for the convention, as I think I had better remain here a few days more, then go to New York, and from there to Pennsylvania, and get a case worked up for Cameron and his friends to present to the President, and if by the time I get West something is not done, I will start the Ills, papers agoing, and try the effect of that on Stanton.
You must get some of your solid New England men to go to New York and raise a breeze there. I am confident that all that is wanted is time to make things come around right. In haste.

My dear General: Your speech at the Military was a very happy one, and no danger in it. Still, I tremble every time I see a notice of your speaking. If I knew of an assassin about Louis Napoleon, and he should persist not only in allowing him about, but actually would improve all occasions to be where he was, even when it was not absolutely necessary, I should think he was foolish, and so would you. A single speech may be the knife that contains the death. Speeches of public men are the assassins they bear about with them.
Our speech more and only one, and that out West, is all you should make, all. I doubt either the wisdom or the necessity of your coming to Concord the 17th. It is too near a view. It bears upon its face, ""Demagoguing for the Presidency."" It will bear that construction by your enemies. Many of your sincere friends doubt its wisdom. They say ""it may be safe enough,"" perhaps it is well enough, etc. I hope to come to Lowell this week to see you. You could write a letter declining for fear of misconstruction of your motives. Misjudged motives you may well fear. The enemies bullets at the same time count, lead, not logic, deeds, not threats, acts, not talk, etc. You can string a month of adjectives that will sound well in a letter. Take upon yourself Caesar's modesty, and thrust by the crown though it be tendered thrice.

Dear General: I have been ordered to report to General Gilmore for duty, who is going to try his skill in the ""Department of the South.""
General Gilmore anticipates only a temporary stay in his new Department, and in asking for me, it was taken into consideration as affecting my relationship with you, and he desired me to state this to you, as the Secretary seems not to have followed the formalities of service in not issuing the order relieving me from your staff.
From all I can gather, I stand as being temporarily detached from your staff. I am too old a soldier, though, to believe in any temporary order. It is not in the nature of military affairs, a thousand exigencies may arise to prevent the establishment of the old order of things. I therefore regard my returning to duty under your orders as something only that may happen. Feeling this, I may be excused if I express myself as if this separation was final.
I have much to remember you for, in the consideration, kindness, and courtesy you ever exhibited towards me while connected with your staff; the manifestation of such feelings went far to encourage me in my labors when dispirited by a terrible climate and contending against obstinate difficulties.
I cannot help but think you conceived the true spirit when you held the Heads of your Department responsible for their particular sphere of action. Looking only to the results, I cannot help but feel myself that such was the freedom under which I labored that whatever shortcomings there may be in my department, I alone am responsible.
Another rule of action which seemed to govern you, and a correct one, in my estimation for strength, and success, was the defence you always made for those serving you. It is an armor to every subaltern.
While I regret I could not have labored on under your guidance, I accept the change which takes me into active duty with satisfaction, for I feel that I had no right in these times to be idle. Remember me kindly to Mrs. Butler. I am, General,

But I cannot forbear telling you again that the necessity of troubling you, as I have on several occasions, with my affairs has caused me inexpressible pain, or of assuring you that the months I have waited for justice to be done you have abated in nowise my unwavering confidence in your future preeminence. I am sure it is but a question of time, and if I could I would wait until doomsday, and you should never hear a word of impatience from me. But it is no longer possible, and I am now obliged to do something for my support.
Your many kindnesses to me encourage me to ask the aid

Pardon me, General, if in this I seem presumptuous. I am sure I do not mean to be. It is the result of my opinion that the poor and oppressed of whatever color, wherever you are known, believe in you as their champion.

Dear Sir: I am satisfied that there is still a chance for an expedition to Texas if you will consent to take command of it. Of course the State, with the exception of El Paso and perhaps Fort Davis, which can be best managed by the Commandant of New Mexico, must be made into a separate military department.
I can assure you that if you will go in for the movement, no matter how small a force may be assigned you, and will land at or near the mouth of the Rio Grande, you can make it a brilliant success. As the yellow fever visited Montonnoys and Brunsville last season, they will probably be exempt this time. At all events, the prospect for Western Texas is better as regards health than that of New Orleans.
The movement of Gen. Sam Houston for the restoration of the Republic, coupled with the fact that the Mexican Legation has withdrawn, has alarmed (and not without cause) the Secretary of State. The opposition both from him and the Secretary of War must now cease. I beg you to give this matter your serious and early consideration. If you choose, you can, I am satisfied, have a chance. You can restore to the Union a State in average equal to six and a half of New York, and which will at once be divided into two, and a few years later may be divided into five.

I have received your telegram in relation to Gen. Fremont's publication, and now wish to prevent what seems to be a misapprehension. I alluded to the publication of Maj. Gen. Fremont of his argument in the New York Herald of the 11th instant, which is now being extensively copied and commented upon by the press, not to his presenting his arguments for the use of any board of office.
My own judgment quite coincides with that of the Secretary
of War when you say that ""it is not perceived in what manner a publication can aid or influence the decision,"" and you will do me the favor to observe that through no act of mine has the matter gone to the public. But the difficulty is, my position not being correctly stated by General Fremont, he asserting that I rest my rank on the supposed intention of the President instead as is the fact on the actual priority of commission (as I have had the honor to state, his bearing date in July and mine in May 1861), I am made to appear to the country as pressing an absurd, and as is proclaimed an immodest claim to rank to which I have no shadow of title.
Thus I am injured in feeling and reputation by the publication, and my cause prejudged from ex parte statements by my brother officers who may sit upon the tribunal to which it shall be referred.
I think the department rightly refuses the publication upon my part, and I obey its laws and orders, but am left to infer that Gen. Fremont disobeys general orders No. 151, Series of 1862 to my injury with impunity. I have the honor to be,

"June 22, 1863","From General Butler
Lowell, June 22, 1863 Hon. Wm. H. Seward Secretary of State
Sir: I have the honor to acknowledge the receipt of a note from the Department of State enclosing note of Baron Gerolt, Minister resident of the King of Prussia at Washington. By a mistake in my office the papers were filed away as finished, while they were in fact unanswered. I have a very vivid recollection of the facts relating to the ""Essex"" because of most troublesome investigations and proceedings which grew out of it.
On the 17th of September the Custom House authorities reported to me, through my Provost Marshal, that a large quantity of Bullion and plate was being shipped on board the ""Essex,"" some of which was known to be the property of most violent and outspoken enemies of the United States, for the avowed purpose of putting it beyond the seas to aid the rebel cause in buying ships and munitions of war. From a hearing of the case there seemed to me probable cause to believe the truth of the information, and I therefore directed the Acting Collector to refuse a clearance of the ship until the matter could be examined, and such coin and plate as were clearly intended for use against the United States by their enemies could be taken out, and the ship, which I supposed at that time to be an honest trader, could then sail with the great bulk of her cargo and passengers. Here let me premise, however, that from the course the affair took I became convinced the Capt. and the Acting Prussian Consul were parties to the shipment of these goods, and were endeavoring by every means in their power to aid the enemies of the United States.
The Prussian Consul, the only one accredited, had raised a Battalion and joined the rebel army, and was at that time and is now a General in their service. The Acting Consul, Mr. Kruttschnidt, was his business partner. The firm were large subscribers to the Confederate loan for defence of New Orleans, and Mr. Kruttschnidt was nearly related by marriage, as I was informed, to the Rebel Secretary of State Benjamin.
Therefore every motive of relationship, business connection, and interest would array the Acting Prussian Consul against the United States. I immediately entered upon investigation of the facts alleged against portions of the cargo of the ""Essex"" in person, so that there might be the least possible delay.
While engaged in that investigation, I received the letter of the Acting Consul, the original of which I enclose marked ""A,"" believing at that time that the shipment was an honest act on the part of the Capt.
I answered it as per copy marked ""B,"" hereby annexed. Having satisfied myself that certain packages ought to be detained at least for investigation more extended than could be given to it while the ship was being detained, I made a list of some six or seven packages that in my judgment should not be sent out of the country for the purposes for which I had been informed these were now being transported. To my surprise, the Captain refused to deliver up any of these packages, alleging as a reason that the shippers might hold him responsible. To relieve this difficulty, I caused the shippers to be sent for, and procured from them orders or personal application to take some of the disputed packages off the ship. But the Capt. then refused to permit the shippers to take their own goods, unless all the duplicate bills of lading could be given up. This was a refusal without condition, as the Capt. knew that some of the duplicate bills of lading had been sent to the Consignees at Liverpool, and could not be given up.
In the meantime a demand had been made upon me for $500 in gold per day during the time the ship should be in port. On the 23d. of September a communication was received from Mr. Kruttschnidt, Acting Consul, the original of which is hereto annexed marked ""C,"" In this communication the Consul justified the refusal of the Master of the Ship, made claim for $500 per day damages, suggested that I should use force to take the disputed packages, enclosed a protest of the Master, and then proceeds to explain to me the meaning, intent, and force of my orders and the Acts of Congress.
Not feeling that I needed or desired instruction from an ""alien enemy"" upon these topics, I replied as per copy hereto annexed marked ""D,"" I declined to use force to retake the cargo because I was not yet fully satisfied as to the facts alleged, secondly because it seemed to me that a military order from Head Quarters of a garrisoned city and port were sufficient ""force major"" to justify the compliance of the Captain without actual manual force, and lastly because the very use of violence would have been the subject of complaint on the part of those who were endeavoring, as I believe, to complicate as far as possible the action of the Military Authorities.
The citation of the Acts of Congress or of my orders could
have no bearing upon the questions, because the packages were seized alio intuitu. As bullion to be applied to the purchase of arms, clothing, munitions, or ships of war, they were liable to seizure by the well-settled laws of war. I contented myself, therefore, with informing the Master of the ""Essex"" that he might sail at any time after he placed the disputed packages in the hands of the Custom House Authorities, and proceeded as rapidly as possible in the investigations.
I also append a letter to the Custom House Authorities of one of the shippers in relation to the refusal of the Capt. to allow the shippers their goods, marked ""E,"" and also copy of my letter to the Acting Consul thereupon, marked ""F,"" and the reply of the Acting Consul, marked ""G.""
Pending these proceedings, on the first of July certain of the passengers of the ""Essex,"" finding that she would not sail, applied for their passage money to be refunded, but the Captain would not refund that, and that led to an application to the Provost Marshal and a farther correspondence between the passengers and myself and the Acting Consul, copies of which marked ""H."" ""I."" ""K."" are appended thereto. Mean-while, having finished the preliminary investigations, and having determined that certain packages were not proper to be shipped, such packages were taken out of the ship and the others released from detention. She sailed at the convenience of her master. There seems to be great stress in both the claim of the supercargo and the note of Baron Gerolt based upon the fact that this bullion was put on board with the knowledge of the Custom House officer, but that officer was not placed there to prohibit bullion from being shipped if for a proper and lawful purpose, but to prevent breaches of the revenue laws, therefore his assent or dissent, not knowing the illegal use to be made of the property, can have no effect upon the questions raised.
In all this matter there was the most strenuous endeavor on my part to treat the case with forbearance and courtesy, which if it had been met by corresponding efforts all annoyance and trouble might have been saved.
The claim as made is a most preposterous one in amount if anything was suffered, and is of that class of claims that are brought against the Government in the hope that by claiming too much a compromise may be offered by which more than enough can be got. I have the honor to be

My dear General: I arrived home on Sunday, and am sorry to say that I am very unwell, but hope by keeping quiet a few days to be all right. I found your letters forwarded from Washington, here. The letter enclosing one from Gov. Shepley has not turned up; I would like much to see it. The most sagacious of my political friends think that a place in the Cabinet, as matters now stand, would be the worst thing that could happen you, -- all hands appear to agree that you are the only man that can possibly be made available, and that a position in the Cabinet would class you with those who are at present looked upon as an administrator that has failed. I, however, don't share that feeling. I still believe that if you could be put at the head of war department at any time before the election that you could do enough to satisfy the people that something substantial could be expected. I leave Monday next for Springfield, and will spend some time there and in Chicago. I got the speeches you sent me, but too late for the convention. I am, however, making good use of them. Dr. Cottman was hurting Banks more than anyone I came across; he was talking to everybody, and I heard of him frequently in Washington as having said that he took back all that he had ever said against you, and prayed that you might be put at head of affairs. I talked with him considerable, and whatever his motive may be, he was doing good work. I will hold myself ready to go anywhere you may advise or that you think can do any good. I wish you would write and make any suggestions you think would be of any use to me. I will write you from Springfield.

St. Helena Island, S. C. June 19th, 1865
My dear General: I know not when this will go North, but as I am a few miles distant from Hilton Head, and steamers can slip away to New York without my knowledge, I will pen you a word now.
You see that I have the advantage of Napoleon, for I am in command of St. Helena whereas Bony was a prisoner. I have here the 9th Me., 3rd N. H., 76th Penn., ""Les enfants Perdus"" (independent battalion from New York), and a company of Serrell's engineer regiment. Why a crowd of ""lost children"" (they have just arrived on this island) should follow me around and even name this camp after me, is an important question in a moral point of view. This is considered a healthier point than Hilton Head, and it is the intention to make it ultimately the Hd. Qts. of the Dept. I expect to remain here but a short time, as my business here is only to get these troops into fighting trim. Hunter didn't appear to like being relieved, but tried not to show it. Foote and Dahlgren have not yet arrived. Dupont gave us an entertainment the other day on board the ""Wabash."" The ""Fingal's"" capture was a good thing. She is not much injured, and she steamed up to this island yesterday. She will be a valuable auxiliary. I suppose the enemy will prepare for another attempt on Charleston, knowing that Gilmore has come here.
We don't let even our Colonels know as yet that anything is proposed, but there'll be a make or break somewhere very shortly. Please don't know anything about it from me. Col. Montgomery (of Kansas notoriety) with 1500 darkies is stirring up the Carolinians and Georgians most thoroughly in his ubiquity. We have no news later than the 9th, and therefore do not know who holds Vicksburg, Port Hudson, Richmond, or Washington. You may imagine that we are some-what anxious for the arrival of a steamer. Was not a little amused two days since to hear a New York gentleman say that Gen. Butler had set up a magnificent carriage, etc. in 14th Street (he referred to the Col., and the carriage that was presented to Mrs. Butler), and insisted for some time that he was right and that you were not in Lowell at all. My health is not perfect but I feel better than when I left New York. I want to see the result of this effort and then, if possible, get away from here. Turner is Chief of Staff at Dept. H'd.
Quarters. We went up to Folly Island where Vodges commands, and took a look at the Rebels on Morris Island. They are very saucy and fire (artillery -- sometimes rifles) whenever they see a half dozen of our men together at the upper extremity of Folk Island. A large side-wheel blockade runner ran ashore the other night under both their guns and ours. We got 40 pieces of muslin out of her for the hospitals, the Rebels also got something from her. The two parties met in row-boats near the wreck the other night, both looking for plunder. Fred received his orders from New Orleans (accepting resignation), and with it an autograph letter from Banks, full of palaver, remembered their intercourse in New Orleans with much pleasure, etc. Banks don't know him from Adam. The same old story that charms voters. It certainly amused Fred. His ""last"" is, that if somebody doesn't come down pretty quick with something handsome, he shall go to Ben. Wood.

every soldier should be with any change of station, but by no means pleased with such change. My eighteen months intercourse with yourself and staff I shall never forget, and I live on the hope that some day ere long we may be reunited; and if I may judge by the state of affairs in Pennsylvania and Maryland, that day is not far distant. Your friends in this army are legion, and I have heard it often said, ""For God's sake give us a man at Head Quarters who has force and pluck to carry out his designs without fear, favor or affeclation. Give us General Butler."" The Generals of this army are particularly your friends, as most of them were at Corinth when we were in New Orleans, and they received your orders through the kindness of Beauregard, who always commented on them with a threat of dire vengeance which he never carried out.
We have a magnificent army here in good condition, but for some reason or other we remain in statu quo, no move. Our scouts last night report Bragg's army falling back, possibly true.
I have written to Bell and John Clarke, but as yet have received no replies.

Hilton Head, N. C. June 25th, 1863
Dear General: The Department of the North under the new regime is delving away, it has much to overcome, and much to contend against in a small way, comparatively speaking. The natural features of the country are great auxiliaries to its defences, one man being capable of holding his own against five. It is a kind of half alligator, half mud turtle operation that we are engaged in. We have the reliable facts that the enemy are reduced to the minimum for defence.
Were it not for the impassable swamps and divers streams which intersect these islands in all directions, prohibiting the deployment of any respectable sized body of men or their advance over half a mile in any one direction, I would hope much from the chances of making a square and fierce fight. But this is denied us, and we are driven to pegging away in a manner that only becomes ""regulars."" We are receiving many deserters from the enemies' camp, from whom we make up pretty reliable data as to the disposition and strength of the enemy. They seem to be prosecuting your friend Lovell again with all the pertinacity becoming Southern tyranny. He is under trial again at Charleston with charges against him of selling the city of New Orleans to Gen. Butler for $500,000. I could not help thinking how long you would have struggled as you did without transportation, without anything, at Ship Island, with half a million locked up in your military chest, keeping for this contingency of buying out Lovell. I have become quite familiar in leaving C. S. off my name. Col. Eaton of New York says they will leave a latch string out for me when I get ready to come back.

counterbalanced by the panic in Penn. The pressure seems pretty strong in favor of McClellan. If he is restored; I think the Government may, as Uncle Abe says, ""jest shet up house-keeping altogether,"" for he will ultimately assume the reins of Government, being forced into it by his friends for purposes of their own. Nous verrons.
The Signal officer reports Dahlgren arrived, a few minutes since, at Hilton Head. He and Gilmore have every incentive to press matters Charlestonward. It is given out here that no movement is contemplated at present, but you'll soon hear something ""drap."" I have a very good command now (and they'll have work to do) composed of Brabban's Battery (Regulars), 3rd R. I. Battery, ""Les enfants Perdus"" (Battalion), 7th Conn. (Battalion), 48th N. Y. Regt., 9th Maine, 3rd N. H., 76th Penn., 2nd S. C. (negroes, Col. Montgomery), and Governor Andrew's 54th niggers.
Rather singular that I should have Gov. Andrew's reputation in my keeping, for he staked it on the success of this Regiment. Col. Montgomery caught one of his men (day before yesterday) who had deserted. Called him up yesterday morning at six and asked him if he had anything to say in his own defence. ""Nothing."" ""Then you die at half past nine."" Montgomery quietly reported the matter to me afterward -- verbally -- closing with, ""I accordingly shot and buried him at that hour."" We need cool things of that kind in this climate.

I arrived here on June 9th. I have been attending to my duties since, making one official visit to points occupied in
Honla. I have seen and talked with many people, and by all sorts and all ranks I hear the wish expressed that you should come here. And when the other day I heard that General Strong had arrived, I thought it might be the precursor of your coming. I know there is another place where you could be more useful to the country, displacing two other men, the position of one of whom is unknown to the Constitution, but as I do not see the immediate prospect of that being done, I wish you could come here. It seems too bad to have you idle at Lowell when so much is going on in which you ought to bear a part. From what I read, it would seem that opposition to the Government, and that of a violent kind, was again organizing. This would not have occurred had there been decision, energy, and power shown. A very good spirit prevailed in the North two months ago, but nothing was done to sustain it. There seems to be no business foresight capacity in directing the war, no providence in anticipating the expiration of terms of service by fresh levies.
Through all this I hope you are well, though I know you cannot be happy. Final victory is assured to us. There are resources and virtue enough for this in the end, but God only knows through what calamities this mismanagement is first to carry us.

It strikes me that these riots in New York and in this city are affairs planned. The breaking into gun-shops, the assaults on armories, and the attacks on the drafting agents, show this. I see that Governor Seymour, in his speech to the mob in New York, promised a suspension of the draft. This is yielding and weakness, and is fatal.

Dear Sir: On looking about among the politicians here I find that there is more activity here than elsewhere in reference to prospective politics.
Hon. E. B. Washburne is making a business already of committing men to Grant for the Presidency.
He is wealthy, shrewd, in earnest, determined that Grant shall be the man. I hear good men say he will go into a nominating convention stronger than Lincoln went.
They are trying to get Grant in command of Rosecrans' army & his own too, with perhaps additional reinforcements -- send him across to the Atlantic and eastward on Richmond -- hoping thereby to make him irresistible in a Nominating Convention.
If the administration see the joke, they will see to it that he does not get an opportunity. But if Grant & his western friends can do this thing they will -- I am not misinformed -- they are bending every energy for the enterprise.
The P. O. keeps the Tribune almost if not altogether for Lincoln's renomination. Judge Drummond, Judge Higgins, & some other good men of former days are for Lincoln, I learn. Judge Higgins came to my room last night and stayed till midnight. I learned the Lincoln policy here by heart. I mean the notions of men who would renominate & who they are.
Dr. D. Brainer, a former strong Democratic politician, will be one of the Com. men here. He is all right. But he tells me men here are for Grant or Lincoln generally, and ""cannot be tied to"" as we want them.
Men who work and are of much account are apt to talk some Western man. Well, I don't fear the result in any case except Grant's, nor that one much; but it spoils the good
Committee timber considerably. Brainerd is a Butler man, & one of the best in the state. He thinks we can get a good Com. by looking it up.
I had a talk with the Tribune folks about Mo. They wanted you there instead of Schofield. I told them to talk it up, and the east would take up the cry I'd warrant, & I see in the Tribune yesterday morning a little article on the subject. I send you a paper & one to a friend in Boston to have the Boston papers take it up.
I tell you Grant is going to be in the way in the West, & especially if he takes any more Vicksburgs, -- such for example as Mobile or Savannah, or Richmond, & because they are crowding him, other men ought to be at work.
I am getting the run of the thing in my Diary pretty closely. The League is large in Illinois. About 800 councils & 100,000 members now.
All the strong men of the state are in them. There are fears entertained that Trumbull & other leading politicians will not take a bold stand since Burnside's row with the Times. They all backed down, you know.

A new code of ethics, to prove a negative; no positive charges being made. Mr. McLearn is the agent of Mr. Hamilton, the owner of the Steamer ""St. Maurice."" The steamer was used by the government last summer, and turned over to Judge Morgan, the attorney for Mr. McLearn, in the fall. By a certificate in the Quarter Master General's office, Col. Shaffer declares that he has not settled with Judge Morgan (in consequence of Morgan's absence on a visit to Washington) until it became necessary for him to hand over his books and papers to his successor. As Mr. McLearn's attorney was obtaining no satisfaction from the department, it was deemed advisable for McLearn to come on and see what was the matter. On his arrival here, he finds it necessary
to prove that the boat was not engaged in illicit trade. Col. Hodge, who has been attending to the business here, tells me that the War department requires him to furnish other proof than that which is patent to every sensible man of your turning her over to her owners and ordering Col. Shaffer to settle for the time she was employed by the government, which would not have been done if there was anything wrong about her.

New Orleans, August 5th, 1863
My dear General: I received your letter of last March on the night before the attack on Camp Bisland. Since that time I have been constantly engaged. To-day, through the negligence of the Quarter Master's Department in not furnishing
me transportation, I have a few moments to spare. I am very much obliged to you for your interest in having me confirmed. I had been quarreling for you ever since you left, and was pleased to see that you were fighting for me. Not a word is mentioned here now derogatory to your administration, except that the most bitter secessionists wish to God you were back. They say they always knew what to do when you ordered anything. This is entre nous, of course. Banks makes too many promises, you prophesied this to me.
With regard to our military operations, I suppose you are perfectly posted. Our campaign against Port Hudson commenced in last April, as you know, immediately after we had somewhat organized and straightened out the raw material that Banks brought with him. We moved against Taylor, and through somebody's mismanagement, failed to bag him as we ought and easily could have done, chased him 56 miles above Alexandria, destroyed his fleet, and took 2000 prisoners. Interfered with bringing supplies to Port Hudson, opened communications with Grant, via the Atchafulaya, and then having, as we thought for at least two months disorganized Taylor's forces, we pitched into Port Hudson. Would have taken it on the day the first attack was made if all had done their duty, and finally got it by pertinacious pummeling and out-digging the Rebels. The fall of Vicksburg expedited the matter. I have since then reoccupied the Lafourche country, and my brigade has gone into summer quarters. I have gained credit in the campaign, and this pleases me because it will please my friends. Gen. Banks promised me a furlough a month ago, to take effect as soon as my troops went into summer quarters. I have not had a furlough in four years, my father has died since that time, I have been constantly on duty in these troubles since Jan. 19th, 1861. No one in the Department has such a strong claim. He has given furlough to one General who has been in the Department five months, and to another who has been in the Department seven months. There are seventeen Generals here now. He says I cannot be spared yet; this is all very flattering. I am now on board to dispose of the troops in the Department so as to secure the navigation of the Mississippi as far as Natchez, and to generally improve the defences of the Department, and make additional ones against the Rebels and foreign enemies. I am promised a leave next week. You must have felt highly pleased at the glorious defence of Fort Butler at Donaldsonville
by 125 of our invalids. They drove off 2500 Rebels, killed more than their own number, wounded nearly twice as many, and took more than their own number prisoners. Forts are beginning to tell in this war. I was sorry to see that Strong was hurt. You ought to tell Strong not to be too rash. I am afraid that is his fault. It must make you feel good to see your youngsters of your staff, Strong, Weitzel, etc. getting the credit of dealing to the Rebels the same sort of blows you gave them here. I hope you feel satisfied that we have not forgotten your teachings. I hope and prayed that you would be sent to New York City to touch up those copperhead rioters there.

Some of the bravest and best men that ever lived. Your whole command at Port Hudson praying and begging to have you there, and all proud of having belonged to your old army. The 4th Wisconsin, 6th Michigan, 21st Indiana, 12th & 13th Connecticut, 75th New York, 8th New Hampshire, always where the tough work was. Some now reduced to 150 effective men. The rest of the old division within supporting distance. I have applied for a leave of absence for twenty days, with permission to apply for an extension of forty days, to the War Department. I understand that I am to get the extension clause approved of here, if practicable. If I get what I applied for, and to which I think I am entitled, I intend to come up to Massachusetts and see you and Bell and the rest of them. Will you please tell Major Bell that I received his letter under fire at Port Hudson, and was much pleased to hear from him, and that I will write him some of these days, and that if he would write me every day I would be happy, very happy to hear from him, but to be sure not to growl and get despondent as he did in his last.
Will you please present my sincere regards to Mrs. Butler, and with the best wishes for your welfare, I remain,

I forgot something. Col. Hamlin (son of the Vice President), commanding officer of one of the negro regiments in Ullman's brigade, says I was told by two officers that I could gain no
promotion in this war, because I declined to command those negro regiments in the Lafourche, while you were here. He has gone home on leave, or I would immediately prefer charges against him.

Gentlemen: Your two letters of August 11th & 28th have been received. I was absent on a journey when the first one came to Lowell.
I ordered all the notes and other property in hands of the several banks in New Orleans sequestered by the Confederate States to be held by them to be delivered upon order of the Commanding General.
The money deposited by the Receivers of the Confederate States I sent to the Treasurer of the United States, and it is now deposited there for the benefit of those who may have claim to it. I think your notes will be found in Citizens' Bank in New Orleans, as that was the bank wherein most of the business of the receivers was done.
The returns of all the banks as to the property sequestered in their possession were left on the files of the Department of the Gulf when I was relieved of its Command.

New Orleans, Aug. 25th, 1863
Dear Sir: The death of General Strong has filled me with deep regret and sorrow. He was the last person I saw in New York when last in that city, or rather he was one of the last outside of my own family. He told me of his contemplated trip to Charleston, and expressed his gratification that if you took the field you were to have him again on your staff, which afforded him great satisfaction.
I have been looking with interest for the announcement of Parton's book. I have no doubt it will be a valuable addition to the history of the times. Your friends are moving in New York and elsewhere quietly but effectually to bring your name out for President, though the movement has not assumed a general character. I know enough of the parties supposed in it to appreciate their earnestness and power, and their wishes cannot be overlooked; in fact they form this very day that powerful middle or rather powerful minority that generally has to be consulted to make a lasting peace. However much in times past military glory may have carried popular favor; and however potential it still is, yet the public demand now something more than military -- they have got too much of war and war men, and feel that a man is now needed who possesses administrative power, has a will of his own, and a clear idea how to use it. Such a man, General, I think they have in you, and my impression is that the public mind must in the multitude of aspirants finally settle down upon the true hero of New Orleans. I think this pens the warm feelings which are entertained for you among the laboring classes of people here, and among, in fact, the great mass of people.
I see indeed many persons who were politically and personally opposed to you when you were here who would now rejoice to see you return. They feel the advantage of some decided mind.
Whenever the active military operations of our armies cease, and our soldiers are only necessary for the purpose of holding places, then must come the most difficult part of our national difficulties, the final adjustment will be the test of our capacity
to recover a nation, and in this struggle, General, I trust you will take your true position, for it would be a curse to the country if you were by jealousy and enmity of people in power kept from your true position as a civil and military leader. In these sentiments I find I am most cordially sustained by all the young and active thinkers I met with last May and June in Washington and Norfolk. Please remember me to Mrs. Butler, Mrs. Parker, and believe me your obdt. servant and obliged friend,

Despatch inviting me to Springfield received. Just returned from a journey. Should be glad to meet my brothers of the Northwest upon the momentous questions of the present future.
Rebellious states exist only by the surprise or weakness of the parent government. Compromises are impossible save between equals in right. Reorganization or reconstruction is alone useful where various parts are to be left out. Amnesties are for individuals, not organized communities.
Therefore, prosecute the war, bring every part of the country into submission to the laws of the United States, then there will be no place for rebellion, no parties for compromises, no occasion for reconstruction, and clemency may be shown and amnesty offered to individual citizens who deserve it. Is there any other way to restore the Union?

Application has been made to me by Hon. P. H. Morgan, of New Orleans, in behalf of the New Orleans and Bayou Mail Company, for a statement of the facts and circumstance of the taking and use by the U. S. forces in Louisiana of the steamers ""Laurel Hill"" and ""Iberville"" in May, 1862.
When the U. S. Army arrived in New Orleans, May 1, 1862, these steamers were found by me in charge of the naval forces. The boats were lying at the piers, one of them, the ""Iberville,"" not in repair.
Transportation being of urgent necessity for the purpose of the expedition up the river to Vicksburg under command of General Williams, I called upon the Admiral commanding to turn over these boats to me, to which he consented, and for which I gave him my receipt. I caused the boats to be put in repair, and they were used continually from about the middle of May, 1862, in the transportation service of the United States in the Quarter-Master's Department, till the 16th day of December, 1862, when they were turned over to Col. Holabird, Chief Quarter-Master of the department under General Banks.
The boats were very large, capable of transporting 1500 men with their provisions for sixty days.
The use of the boats was never paid for by my order, while in command. I was informed and believe the boats were saved from destruction by the rebels by the exertions of those having them in charge.

And more imperative did our obligations become not to weary in our efforts till we had rescued the spot where we had seen so many of our comrades fall.
Our operations here present the anomaly of taking the bull by the horns because we are weak. We can burrow up to a place, which double our numbers would doubt over contending for in open field; and there also can be such a state of affairs as will render powerless a place of the enemy's without possessing it, -- such are we rendering Charleston, in fact is about so now.
The possession of Cumming's Point gives us a clean sweep of the whole harbor. All her wharves are now at the mercy of my guns.
John Bull will find it of very little profit, after taking the chances of the gaunt let of the fleet, of getting a 200 pound shell in the hull of his vessel while unloading his commodities at the wharf of Charleston. To hold Charleston would require 20,000 men, while the Confederacy would feel her loss no more than she does to-day. Sumter is a picket post of the enemy, that is all that is left of her. The result of Rosecrans' operations will affect us greatly, and we have everything to hope in that direction from our latest accounts.
Grant and Banks seem to be pondering over deep-laid schemes. I think them on the important arena of operations, and when I think of it, the greater does the injustice to you become in my opinion.
It was of right your field, and I shall ever deem it unjust that you were not allowed to reap the reward.

General: You have a very warm friend and admirer in Rev. R. McCurdy of Washington. He is a D. D. and LL. D., warmly interested in National affairs and influential in political circles, particularly in Kentucky and other border states. He regards you as the most available candidate for the Presidency, and is working to secure the nomination.
I have requested that a full set of photographs with descriptions be sent to you. I have no doubt they will prove interesting.
I expect another free fight this winter with Gov. Andrew. His course in reference to me has been in violation of good faith, and is infamous. I expect to ask an investigation and show him up.
The condition of my affairs in Mass. prevented me from accepting a commission unconditionally; the only condition I made was that whenever a suspension of active operations would permit I should be permitted to protect my property and defend my reputation in Mass. Stanton would agree to no conditions, and I would not accept without. I offered to serve in the management of the railroad as a civilian without
pay. Stanton, probably at the instance of Andrew who was with him at the time, tried to force me to accept a commission. I refused, some strong language was used, and I told the Secretary that if he was not satisfied that I should serve as a civilian he could relieve me altogether. I was relieved.
The condition of military railroad affairs in the west is such that our operations cannot be successful, the railroads can forward neither troops nor supplies. Confusion reigns supreme, and Stanton is responsible for the whole of it. Halleck urged him more than a year ago, and repeatedly, to give authority to remedy defects and correct abuses, but he would not do it. Inefficiency characterizes both the War and Navy Departments. As a civilian, I have a right to think and to say what I think.

"October 6, 1863","From General Butler to Salmon P. Chase
Private. Lowell, October 6th, 1863
Dear Sir: Since I saw you I have been reflecting with some care upon the subject of the future of Louisiana.
Its importance grows upon me. If that state, by a change of her Constitution, abolishing Slavery and forbidding the payment of the Confederate Debts of all kinds forever by the act of her own people, can ask readmission to the Union the first of any, the question which of all others is the most dangerous one now open will be settled forever.
The President says ""the Proclamation if valid will stand,"" but if invalid in the opinion of the present Supreme Judges, what then? Its effect and purport must be embalmed in the Constitutional law of the several seceding States, and then the question will never come before that tribunal, or if it does, will never affect those who are freed by its utterances.
If Louisiana shall first come into the Union in the manner I have described, all the rest will follow. If North Carolina asks first to come in, even with hands dripping with the blood of Union soldiers, although she may never have repented by a change of heart, or have done ""works meet for repentance,"" or even have said, ""I have sinned against Heaven and in Thy sight,"" she will be received, and the fatted calf killed, and thus the keynote furnished for all the rest. That Louisiana will come all in good time I doubt not, but early, prompt, energetic action is needed. In view of this most desirable end, I am
tempted to say to the President that if he desires this thing done, I will go to New Orleans with a view of bringing about such result. I point him to the representations sent under my administration there to the last Congress as an earnest of what may be done. . . . I suppose that the President will be unwilling to take so decided a step in favor of the radical party in Missouri as to send me there even if he removes Schofield, and I desire always to disembarrass him as much as possible wherever I am concerned. This is the personal embarrassment. If he should remove Schofield, and then, after the urgent request made for me, should appoint another without giving me anything else to do after my long idleness, such treatment would give color to the foolish reports that are in circulation that I am kept out of employment because of some supposed rivalry for the succession, and that would be most annoying and unjust to him; or give evidence to another report that I am not employed because of some supposed personal dereliction of duty, which would be equally unjust to me. This of course would leave me but one remedy, and that would be to tender my Commission to the President, thereafterwards be at liberty to act in self-vindication, but I usually decline to take the defensive. In consenting to go to New Orleans I swallow pride and feeling to a great degree for the sake of the country and its cause, and for the purpose of not being in any way in opposition to the administration, which has enough load without even the feather weight of mine.
I will not close this note, which I have marked confidential, without calling your attention to the remark you made to me that the Currency could not stand six months more of the present expenditures. For mercy sake do not say so again, for such is the confidence of the country and its business men in your knowledge of workings of finances and the state of monetary affairs, that the very knowledge of your thought would bring its own verification. Upon you rests the expectation of the Nation in its financial affairs, and I have no doubt that the utterance of the thought you gave me made on ""Change"" would cause a loss of confidence in the public stocks.
Excuse this epistle in its length and suggestions. From

Holabird just now told me they were going to send some men by water to coöperate with the force already gone, and that they would be landed this side of Galveston some place -- possibly at Sabine Pass again, as he took pains to say emphatically that they had ""positive information that it is still feasible."" The transports are taking on coal & water for ten days.
I am not changed in any opinion I entertained in New York as to the time when the enterprize will succeed.
No frank man that I have met has any confidence in it. Many expect the whole force out there will have to return. The force is estimated variously from 20-40 thousand -- probably 20 to 25 thousand, I think.
The Rebels have about as many, it is said, and are entrenched (?) fifteen miles from our front. If so, then I predict another Port Hudson.
Banks was out there, and returned the night we landed --
Monday. Gen. H. has seen him -- he talks confidently & cheerfully. I have not spoken with him yet myself.
I shall seek him tomorrow -- and get what I can out of him.
I have the Tribune on my shoulders, after the fashion of the letter, a copy of which I enclose, and which I will have covertly reach Banks' ear.
Oct. 16th
I WAS interrupted here. I saw Banks yesterday morning. He came into his parlor -- we shook hands -- I said, ""I hope you are very well, General."" He made no reply, but looked so stiff I thought I would apologize a little for being there. I said, ""I have no specific business, General, I only called to pay you my respects."" He still said nothing. I then said, ""Well, I guess we will get to Texas this time without fail."" He then said, ""Had you nothing to say to me?"" in a very cold, forbidding manner, and I, with an emphasis that could not be mistaken said instantly, ""No, sir."" He understood by my reply that I knew he meant to insult me, & that I didn't care a --. He walked out of the room at once without saying a word, not even ""good morning.""
This is a faithful, literal report of our interview. From the intimacy of last winter between B. and myself it was not only quite proper but necessary civility for me to call on him at his house in the manner I did.
No one knows of it here except Major Plumly, whom Banks asked in my hearing to come into the parlor with him. I shall pay no attention to it, mention it to nobody -- unless I hear of it from Plumly or Banks.
Banks, I am satisfied, will never conquer Texas. He may manufacture another Port Hudson, and glorify himself for taking it, but he will postpone the taking of it until some time next May.
If it be possible, come down here yourself, if not send Hooker, or a better man if you know him.
Banks is issuing rations to bet. 60,000 & 70,000 men to-day. About 5,000 of those, I am told by officers are Banks men -- the balance Butler men. An officer told me yesterday that if you were to ride along the 19th Army Corps they would ""nearly go beside themselves.""
There is a general quarrel here -- Bowen (P. M. Gen.) is north representing one party -- Ex. M. C. Flanders representing another -- I have not got into the its of the row yet.
Gen. H. is going to make a speech to-morrow night in the city.
He thinks of remaining here a month now, and we take quarters here to-day, I suppose in some unoccupied house.
I do not see much use of being here unless we can have a change of commanders, -- hence, if you go to Missouri and Kansas, I think I shall want you to send for me. I have told you that I want to make some money, in a legitimate way, of course, but I want to make some. If I could come out there and rove a little amongst the Northwestern politicians I think I could make myself serviceable. But you know best.
If there is a chance of getting Texas occupied before a nominating convention is called, why then this is my field of course. But that cannot, or at least I am confident will not be under Banks.
A Brig. Gen. said to me yesterday, ""Banks will never conquer anything -- if he does go to Texas he will only occupy some point & then crow about it -- why he has had fifty or sixty thousand men in La., and given up all but 10 or 12 Parishes that Butler had conquered, so that not more than that amount of territory is to-day occupied in the state. If the Gen. Govt. could only know the kind of machine B. is, they would be infamous not to remove him immediately. He has no idea here except one -- that is who shall be nominated for the Presidency in '64. He tells nobody, not even his Generals, what his plans are, because when he fails to execute them he wants no one to know it so that he may publish flaming Bulletins that ""the object of the En. has been fully accomplished,"" and in the same strain much farther the same Gen. proceeded.
You know him well -- he was here when you were here, & has recently been North.
If you will write me to New Orleans, care of Gen. Hamilton, I will get it without fail & be obliged. I shall be on the qui vive.
Faithfully yours, J. K. Herbert"

Dear Sir: Lieut. Col. Henry Finnegan has been known to me many years. No man's reputation for courage and energy stood higher than his before the war, and it had been tested.
At New Orleans he behaved with the most determined bravery in making the arrest of a most noted ruffian, ""Red Bill,"" who, charged with seven murders, had hid himself in a swamp, where Finnegan went after him alone. For his bravery, fidelity, and good conduct I promoted him to a Lieut. Colonelcy of a colored regiment.
He had been dismissed from that command without trial, without a hearing, without a Court, without right, as I believe. I would trust my life to his courage sooner than to any man I know.
Pray give him a hearing, and I will answer for it he will show the same courage that he did at Bull Run, at Biloxi, at Pontchatoula under General Strong, who speaks of Finnegan in the highest terms in his official report.

Hon. S. P. Chase, Sec'y of Treasury, Washington, D. C.
My dear Sir: Your note written in the cars of the date of October 9th, given to Mr. Camp, was mailed the 13th, and being missent reached me yesterday.
I am grateful for the interest you take in my affairs. As you do not mention that you received it, I presume at the date of writing you had not mine of October 6th. In that I explained at some length my views about affairs in Louisiana, and as it is to be hoped that the epistle has before this reached you, I will not trouble you with an iteration of the matter therein explained.
I am much obliged for the President's kind remembrance of me. He has always treated me with distinguished kindness, but I am still unemployed. The objections to sending me to New Orleans that he makes are untenable, I believe.
If he gives Banks the state of Texas for a Department I
certainly cannot interfere with him. Banks can have Sabine Pass for a depot of supplies, or Galveston, or Brownsville, or Corpus Christi, or Matergarda. I can assure the President that Banks will never be in my way if he has started on his Texas Expedition overland.
Geographical Military Departments were devised by President Adams the younger to keep Scott and Gaines from quarrelling, and as the device succeeded in keeping those belligerents apart, there need be no fear that Banks and I shall quarrel.
Indeed, there has not been such active and hearty coöperation in this war so far by different Department Commanders as to lead to the inference that Commanders of different Departments are likely to interfere with each other much. Witness: Patterson and McDowell; Wool and McClellan; Pope and Fremont; Hooker and Dix; Grant and Banks; Burnside and Rosecrans; Halleck and Butler at Vicksburg, et id omne genus. Only make two Departments, and we shall be as separate as two tigers in two cages.
As to the other objection, the so-called Union men will object to me, I answer that every true Union man will welcome me. Even Doctor Cottman is ready now to call for me, at least he says so.
To show you that Mr. Hahn is all things to all men, and would gladly welcome the powers that be, I enclose to you an extract from a private letter to me by a friend who did as much for Mr. Hahn's election as anybody, containing a report of a conversation had by him with Mr. Hahn. The remarks spoken of were in Mr. Hahn's New York speech.
Do you not think that Gov. Shepley, my life-long friend, would coöperate with me quite as well as with General Banks.
But if, as the President states, Banks was originally designed for Texas -- why not let him go there? I am no beggar for place, and specially as against Genl. Banks, who has never yet done anything, which depended upon himself, but disaster. Witness, Shenandoah Valley; Cheat Mountain (See Pope's Despatch); march to Alexandria (let the poor Union men given up to destruction by the abandonment of the county, and the captured convalescents of Brasier City, with $2,000,000 of stores and guns, testify); two useless and murderous assaults on Fort Hudson, surrendering the day after the news of the surrender of Vicksburg reached that beleaguered post, and a loss in the seige of ten thousand men; Sabine Pass; and last
and not least the utter failure in recruiting the negro, where with a million dollars' expense and nine months' time, and the full power of the Government, he has not as many men enlisted by himself as he found enlisted when he went to the Department in four months' time, without a dollar's expense to the country, unauthorized by the Government, and only sanctioned in November after it was all done. But something too much of this.
If Grant goes into Rosecrans' Department, as is rumored, who will take charge of Mississippi River and keep it open? I had begun when I was removed upon a scheme for that purpose, founded on the early French and Spanish experience against the Indians, which will sometime have to be carried out by somebody. I should like to explain this matter to the President, but am ashamed to come to Washington any more without his desire. There is another matter of vital interest to the country, about which I have a scheme, but much too long to write. The proclamation for 300,000 will bring no men by volunteering. We shall be obliged to resort to the draft, and that must be popularised. That, too, may be done, and without any resort to Congress. Now, I have determined to offer no more advice where it is not asked or desired. Would you? I call you to witness that the movement of half of Grant's Army to the Potomac, of which I spoke to you at Washington in July, as I advised, would have been wise. Has not the event shown? What has that Grand Army done since? What could it do in the heat of the summer? But I fear you will think this letter is now too long to be read.

Dear Sir: We are now setting our faces toward Texas. A large force is already embarked for the Texas coast. Banks is going himself, I believe. Nothing very positive can be stated now -- things are in a formative state. Next mail I will write at greater length.
The mail is already closed, but I must try to get half a dozen letters in. I met Gen. B. at a select dinner party at the house of Mr. Durant yesterday. At his entrance I was caught -- Judge Whitaker & I were standing together -- B. shook hands
with the Jud. & then reached to me -- I could not cut him there & so took his hand -- but on leaving I did my best bow to each lady in the parlor -- shook Mrs. D's hand -- & then shook hds. with each gentleman in the room -- shook them all around B., and quit with Mr. D. at his side, & turned my back on him without speaking to him. Whether anybody else noticed it or not I do not know, but B. certainly did.
Gen. H., Gen. B., & myself were the only mil. gentlemen there. I was glad that I recd. more than my share of attention, & observed that whenever I caught B's face he was staring at me.
I hope Gen. H. will get a letter from you soon cheering him up and reminding him of our schemes. He is not going with the force at present. He has become convinced that it is best to keep out until it is made a certainty that a foothold is obtained.
Banks is very confident. He is, through my Plumly manoeuver that I think I explained to you, almost completely in the hands of the Texans, they think for the present. My faith is not so strong. He is extremely anxious to save his bacon, and he has learned the only salt for him -- success. I have never seen him so active.
Gen. H. is very much pleased. Banks got some very severe, sarcastic cuts at dinner yesterday from Durant, Whitaker, Judge Howell, & others. I chuckled inwardly, & said good inaudibly.
If you can have Col. Davis, of the 1st Texas Cav., made a Brig. Gen. you will serve a worthy man -- a good, strong friend of yours -- and a brave soldier. He is now acting Brig. His promotion would be an offense to certain prominent individuals here, as it would be deserving. Set Carter to work.

Sir: I have the honor to enclose to you a copy of a note received from Brig. General M. Jeff Thompson, whom I knew in command of the forces immediately opposed to me at Ponchatoula, on the northern side of Lake Ponchartrain, when I was in command in the Department of the Gulf. The original I have sent as requested to Capt. Thornton, of Brig. General Geo. F. Shepley's staff.
Captain Thornton, a most valuable soldier and efficient officer, was grievously wounded with at least seven bullet holes through his clothes and various parts of his body in the attack on Ponchatoula in September of last year, under the command of the late lamented Maj. Gen. Strong, then of my staff. Captain Thornton was left in the hands of the enemy, and received of General Thompson every care and kindness, and at my request was sent to New Orleans upon his parole. This courteous consideration on the part of General Thompson I have no doubt enabled us, with the blessing of Heaven, to save Captain Thornton's valuable life. Gen. Thompson is now a prisoner at Johnson's Island, near Sandusky, Ohio. If not inconsistent with public service, I most earnestly ask that Gen. Thompson may be released upon his parole. While I can testify to the uniform urbanity and courtesy with which all the operations of General Thompson were conducted, I am most decidedly of the opinion that the kindness which he showed to Capt. Thornton alone should entitle him to every possible consideration.
That kindness was not alone given to the officers, but the wounded men spoke of his treatment with the utmost gratitude. I found him a troublesome enemy enough, but his humanity, which was in contrast with the conduct of Gen. Taylor, leads me to ask this favor for him at the hands of the Government.
As I am not much in the habit of asking leniency for rebels, I trust the War Department will take it as a guaranty that this is a proper case for the extension of every indulgence. I am,

His Excellency Governor Andrew
Dear Sir: The Messieurs Sawyer of Fitchburg desire my opinion from experiment and observation of their ""solid case cannister."" I had it in use in the Gulf, and have the most decided opinion upon its merits. The parts of excellence are:
1st. Quite double the range of ordinary cannister, and that range capable of increasing by elevation of the piece.
2nd. Wider spread of the filling, and greater velocity.
3rd. Capacity of being thrown from any rifle as well as any smooth bore of the same calibre without injury to the rifling.
4th. The cannister itself is as against troops quite equal to a solid shot.
If I can get the solid case cannister I will use no other.
Respectfully yours, B. F. Butler"

Dear General: The enclosed extract is submitted not for the purpose of intelligence, but rather to correct any wrong impression which it seems intended to convey. The great body of the people here are fully impressed with your great administrative and executive ability, which was so brilliantly displayed while you were in command of the Department of the Gulf; but of no place is this more perfectly true than of the city of New York.
The fling at the ""Big Bethel"" action is done to justify, or rather to cover a secret motive on the part of the writer, to injure your rapidly-increasing popularity. You are probably aware that the journal which thus causelessly assails you has the fame of another distinguished general to defend, and does not hesitate to strike any rising man who seems to be in his way.
Your first efforts in Eastern Virginia will form an important epoch in the history of this great rebellion, and the high order of military talents, and practical civil ability, brought to bear upon all questions submitted for your action, without instructions from Washington, will ever mark that event as one of the most important of the whole war. Time will vindicate your character from the secret designs of all such enemies as have not the candor to speak of what they would accomplish covertly. I know there is an organized interest in this city to assail and break down any man who cannot be used to promote their own selfish purposes. The journal from which I take this paragraph is the recognized organ of that select class of assumed and self-appointed leaders, and the Presidency is the prize to be played for; and, in turn, for the last year, nearly every General in the army has been the object of attack as circumstances for the moment required, but the General has been all the time faultless, ever brave, ever ready, and still rising!
We all hope every facility will be placed at your command in your present important position, and if the administration will promptly second your efforts we feel confident of an early and a glorious result. I know all that is wanted is the opportunity to vindicate your splendid genius from all such assaults, and to elevate you still higher in the estimation of your country.
I hope it will fall to your lot to take Richmond, and to
thus restore the ""old Dominion"" to her true position in the Union, and so hoping you will believe me

Col. Shaffer affirms that only young men are fit for soldiering; middle-aged men, used to the comforts of home, feel deprivations too keenly. He looks forlorn, no wonder; it is beginning life with a camp chest, and tin candlesticks. I half decided to stay at Washington for the wedding, but it was a delay of four days, and then I must come alone. All things considered I gave it up. I called on Mrs. Lincoln; she was out, the President gave us admittance and frankly told us, after looking at Blanche, that we had a very handsome daughter.
From there I went to see Florence, and to settle arrangements for Blanche to return to school. Florence is fleshly and well content. From there to see Miss Chase, not at home. Miss Netty came on with us, a part of the way from New York, and was very voluble about the wedding and her school. Blanche was better pleased on acquaintance and would not now object to the school.
We took the pleasure boat, ""Carrie Martin,"" at Washington, and came down the Potomac. This is a little steamer kept for the use of the President and Cabinet, and loaned to us by the Secretary of War. We thought it would be delightful, but dear me, when we got into the Bay, it was tossed about like a nut-shell, and by no means a seaworthy craft. We were all sick. Blanche had teased herself along, she may stay till Christmas.
Sister Blandine could not take her in music before that time. I may send her back sooner. When we arrived, the usual salute was given, the gentlemen went on shore. I thought we might have an invitation to Mrs. Gen. Foster's, as so many had claimed our hospitality when at the Fortress before, but no
courtesy was offered. At evening two rooms were engaged at Willard's, a most forlorn little hotel, where we slept, the floor was soft compared to the bed. Mr. Butler had sent forward to Genl. Foster that he would buy or receipt for the furniture, and save him the trouble of moving and us of furnishing the Government House.
When we came in the next morning we found the house quite bare. Mrs. Foster was finishing the last packing, and would be ready to leave very soon. We stepped into a vacant room and ordered a fire (the morning was quite chilly), and waited there till they left. Dirt, dirt, dirt, and a house to furnish. These Army people have a way of scuffling in and out of houses peculiar to themselves. I know of no parallel but Mrs. Ames. Dirt before and behind them. I have a horror of it, and told Stephen to wipe up the dust from the floor where we sat. My skirts were full of it. A carpet had been pulled up and the dust remained. It is a curious thing that I have got this house to clean and furnish again. The Fosters were not pleased that we came. But as Mr. Butler had not desired the place, there was no occasion for incivility to us. Mrs. Foster stepped in a moment before she left, but not a word of apology or regret at the forlorn look at things. When I saw Capt. Kensel, he said, ""Mrs. Butler, you can hardly like the look of things."" I answered, ""You know, I am not acquainted with the usages of the Army; in civil life it would look a little strange."" Yesterday we rode on the beach, Blanche and the Genl. on horseback, Capt. Clark and I in a buggy. The day was very fine, the drive delightful. We rode four miles up the beach, smooth and firm as a floor.
When I was here before we did not venture where the beach is firm, but were obliged to plunge along through the sand where the horse could hardly pull us along.
The officers' quarters are furnished with secesh furniture, and a quantity packed in the Fort is overhauled for our use. We shall be settled in three or four days more, plainly but comfortably. Moving and cleaning old furniture are not agreeable pastimes. Poor people roving about the country are obliged to change their abode very frequently. When we are better off we shall settle down and enjoy the comforts of life. Fisher will leave to-morrow.
Mr. Butler goes to Newbern on Wednesday. I should go with them, but I cannot bear the thought of going round Point Hatteras. They will be gone about a week. Some of
the staff think Head Quarters should be at Norfolk half of the time. If so, I may have to furnish another house.
I do not like this place, never did. I should like the children to come while we are here if there should be an opportunity. We miss them very much. Fisher goes this afternoon. I shall drop this in the mail, as he stops at Washington.
I keep scratching on, -- really I have nothing further to say, only this is a doleful place and home is better.
Blanche still hangs on. I urged her off with Fisher, but another week and so on. I have an idea we may not stay here long. Dear love to the children.
Very affectionately, Sarah"

My dear General: My friend, Brigadier General Charles K. Graham, has just stepped in to pay me a visit, and informs me he wrote you the other day, begging you to be so good as to apply for him to be assigned to a post under your command. I feel very great pleasure in adding (to his own) my cordial request that you gratify him by having (if practicable) his wishes in this respect complied with at an early day.
General Graham has seen severe work with the army of the Potomac, first of all, as Colonel of the regiments of the Excelsior Brigade; and, subsequently, as Brigadier General commanding the Pennsylvania brigade, in Kearney's old Division, with which he fought at Chancellorsville, and, last fall, at Gettysburg, where he was badly wounded and taken
prisoner. He has not sufficiently recovered from the effect of his wound to undertake a command in Eastern Tennessee, which was offered him by General Foster, the campaign in that Department promising to be one of unremitting labor and exposure. Nor does he desire to return to the army of the Potomac, since he would be unpleasantly situated in being ranked by an officer he feels and believes to be his inferior. This, of course, I take liberty of mentioning in a friendly way, so that you may perfectly understand his desire of being assigned the post he has designated in his letter to you.
You will, be assured of it, find in General Graham a throughly reliable and efficient officer, and an accomplished and high-toned gentleman. I cordially recommend and support his application to you, therefore, and begging you will be so good as to consider it most favorably, and secure his services. I remain with sincere regard,

"November 14, 1863","From General Butler
Headquarters, Department of Va: & North Carolina, Fort Monroe,
November 14th, 1863
Hon. E. M. Stanton, Sec'y. of War
Sir: After the conversation I had with you in the War Office, in which Hatteras was suggested as a depot of prisoners, upon reflection there were certain disadvantages which occurred to me, among which was the difficulty of transportation and supplies, requiring sea-going steamers or otherwise conveyance through part of the country which might be intercepted by the enemy. In the haste with which it is necessary to determine the question, I made all possible examination of the points in the Department under my command advantageously to be occupied for such a purpose, and have determined that Sewall's Point, lying opposite Fort Monroe, about 3½ miles across the Roads and two miles from the Rip-Raps, upon the whole was the best site which could be selected for the purpose. It is healthy, easy of access, dry, having a large growth of wood upon it, lying immediately in the path necessary for exchange, abounding in excellent water to be had by digging, and immediately under the guns of our Fleet in the Roads, and indeed almost if not quite under the guns of our Fort. The soil belongs to disloyal men, with, I believe, a single exception, who is willing to rent his farm, consisting of 250 acres, for one thousand (1000) dollars a year with the buildings thereon. There are buildings on the proposed tract sufficient for hospital purposes.
There is a small earthwork upon it erected by the rebels, fitted to resist a land attack, which might be made the Head Quarters of the local garrison. There is an area of one mile by 2½ miles between two creeks which will enable guards to be posted so as to render escape difficult, and bordered on the other side by the sea, so that there will be sufficient ground on which all prisoners may be put which we are likely to capture. In one of the creeks there is a depth of some ten feet of water, in which there is a wharf already erected at which vessels can lie in all weathers.
The disadvantages of the location are the possibility of the re-capture of Norfolk by the rebels in order to reach the prize of releasing their prisoners, and the difficulty of strictly guarding the land side line of the depot. But balancing these difficulties with the advantages, my opinion inclines very strongly
in favor of the selection of the spot. The expense of guarding will be more than compensated by the economy of transportation, and the ease of access and the feasibility of delivering prisoners for exchange or otherwise.
Therefore I shall be ready to receive any prisoners you may send within ten days so far as having storehouses and guards; provided you shall approve of this selection. If you do not so approve, please notify me by telegram.
I have also examined the points of land on which Forts Clark and Hatteras are situated, and I can be equally ready by the time prescribed to receive prisoners there, where there can be neither possibility of escape or expense of a large guard. The disadvantages there are bleakness, unhealthiness, and cost of transportation, but in the winter transportation may be carried on by the Dismal Swamp Canal and the Sounds by Roanoke Island. To do this it will be necessary, however, to place as large a force along those canals to prevent interruption as it would to guard Sewall's Point.
In my telegram I asked for the detail of Brig. Gen'l. Hinks for Commandant of the Depot. I know Gen'l. Hinks' efficiency and activity, because he was with me in April, 1861, then a Lieut. Col. in Militia, and while his many wounds prevent him from very laborious field duty, I know of no man better for this particular purpose. Gen'l. Hinks' services are substantially lost to the country where he is in command of a conscription camp in Concord, N. H. Awaiting instructions, I am

Major Stewart, the Engineer in charge of the Fort, kindly called my attention to the Army regulation Par. 51, which requires the sanction of the Secretary of War for the alteration
of any building within ½ mile of the Fort. A very proper and salutary regulation in time of peace, but I think wholly inapplicable in time of War. But wishing to relieve his fears of breach of the regulations, I respectfully make application for your approval of this act, and it becomes more necessary because of the celerity of my Quarter-Master Department.

The whole subject of exchange of prisoners is under direction of Major-General Hitchcock, to whom, as commissioner of exchange, that branch of the service has been committed. He will be glad to have any idea or suggestion you may be pleased to furnish, but there should be no interference without his assent.
It is known that the rebels will exchange man for man and
officer for officer, except blacks and officers in command of black troops. These they absolutely refuse to exchange. This is the point on which the whole matter hinges. Exchanging man for man and officer for officer, with the exception the rebels make, is a substantial abandonment of the colored troops and their officers to their fate, and would be a shameful dishonor to the Government bound to protect them. When they agree to exchange all alike there will be no difficulty.

November 18th, 1863
Hon. E. M. Stanton, Sec'y. of War
Sir: In the limits of a telegram and for the public eye it was impossible to explain my full thought on the subject of Exchange of Prisoners. I believe there was some misunderstanding upon the questions involved when I telegraphed, and your answer, with the sentiments of which in every word I concur, convinced me that I was right in my belief.
No one will go farther in exerting every power of the Government in protecting the colored troops and their Officers than myself. And if that is the question which prevents exchange, and we stand before the country upon that question, I have not a word farther to urge. But I fear that is not the point, or at least it is not now understood by the country that it is upon the pledge of the country's honor that all men, white or black, who fight for us, shall be protected, that we now feel obliged to let our fellow-soldiers starve, if such shall be the inhumanity of the Rebels.
I ought to premise, perhaps, why I interfere where it is not specially within my command. Believing that I could do something for the good of the service, I take the liberty of making the application, and with your leave shall continue to make suggestions wherever and whenever I think the Government may be aided by so doing, although not strictly called upon so to do, to complete my routine of duty.
I am informed and believe that the Rebel Authorities will exchange every Officer and Soldier they now hold in custody, whether colored or not, upon receiving an equivalent number in rank from us. Indeed I can put no other interpretation upon the letter of Robert Ould, Esq., Agent of Exchange in
Richmond, of October 20th, referring to a letter of a previous date. I have forwarded copies of all the correspondence so that you can refer to it. If there is any interpretation to the contrary, it is not made apparent to the country. And the Government, for all that appears from the correspondence between the two Commissioners, are now suffering our soldiers to be starved to death upon the proposition of inequality in the computation and value of paroles. If you will examine the correspondence, it will be seen that the whole question turns upon that point -- not a suggestion is made that color, caste, or condition has anything to do with the dispute. It would seem that the discussion had grown sufficiently acrimonious to have lost sight of the point of dispute, as we know many discussions do. I do not mean to impute blame to any party, because I am not sufficiently informed, nor have I the authority so to do, but simply to suggest a remedy. I assume that we have in actual custody some 26,000 prisoners against 13,000 that the Rebels have. Now then, why may not Ould's proposition be accepted, and we exchange man for man, officer for officer, until the Rebels stop -- if then every prisoner they hold has been exchanged, then the question of color does not arise, and our men will have been relieved from starvation up to that number. But if the colored prisoners and their officers shall not be produced by the Rebels for exchange, we shall have 10,000 of their men upon whom to work both retaliation and a reprisal to the fullest extent, to wring from the Rebels justice to the colored soldiers. It is not necessary to argue this point, its statement is the argument. This action -- not offers and correspondence -- will place the Government right before the country, and if then the negro prisoners, whether civilians or soldiers or their officers, are kept in prison or maltreated, the world will justify us in reprisal and retaliation to any extent.
I believe that this exchange will be made by the rebels from information derived from various sources, and specially from J. W. Monfort, agent of the State of Indiana, who has gone to Washington, and from whom you can learn the facts that lead to my belief.
Without suggesting any blame upon the part of the Agent of Exchange, would it not in fact seem to be that such a state of feelings has grown up between himself and the Rebel Agent, that without doing anything which would impute wrong or detract from the appreciation of the efforts of General
Meredith, this might be done as if outside of either Agent. This is submitted for consideration with single desire to relieve the soldiers, now in condition to enlist all our sympathies.
I can make these suggestions all the more freely, as I have this evening to arrange the affairs of this Department in North Carolina, and can have probably no personal part in the matter. I have the honor to be,
Very respectfully,

A thousand copies have been bound without it, all of which are sold in advance. For the second thousand, which are already printed, the bust will probably come in time, as I have informed Mr. Brackett that we are ready and anxious to receive it. Everything promised well for the sale; there appears to be a general desire to see the book. The abuse of the Herald would alone suffice to make the public prick up their ears.
The papers tell us that you are at work in the old way. I have myself heard bad accounts of affairs in your Department. A Boston publisher, who traversed the whole of it a month ago, brought back word that the insolence of the Secesh in Norfolk was riling to the Union temper, and that the general look of things about Fortress Monroe was untidy and unsoldierlike. He, also, said that there was a general expectation in the department that ""Old Ben Butler,"" as he dared to style you, would put things straight. Why ""old""? I continually hear of old Ben Butler. Perhaps it is from the similarity to old Ben Franklin.
H. G. is sot. He will not talk of the subject. He said a good thing the other night. He said that if he had been president in 1861, he should have sought out the man that had the biggest brain in America, whether a military man or not, and made him lieutenant-general with full powers. Good, said I; but the very man presented himself, and was cast
aside -- Gen. B. F. B. He then, with curious inconsistency, said that war was a trade, and it would never have done to have given the supreme command to a lawyer. Such is man.

Dear Sir: I was very much gratified at the interview, although limited, which I happened to have with you on your recent railroad trip from Morehead City to Newbern.
My greatest regret was that I could not have a more extended opportunity to converse with you in reference to various matters of vital pecuniary as well as political interest to the Government.
As it was, I separated with the conviction that your wellknown acquaintance with political science, together with your eventful military experience in the great drama now being enacted, would enable you to pursue such a policy as must result in great good to the country.
After saying this, allow me to allude, briefly, to some matters of much moment in regard to trade and commerce in North Carolina.
You will doubtless have applications ere long to favor the introduction of cargoes of goods through Hatteras Inlet direct to Newbern. Should this happen, I trust that such requests may not be complied with, for the following reasons:
First. That much controversy has already been had in relation to the policy and practice of introducing large cargoes of goods by way of Hatteras Inlet under the plea of ""military necessity,"" when no such necessity existed, and when upon the contrary it was palpable that said cargoes were brought in exclusively for speculative purposes.
Second. That passing directly through to Newbern unless from some actual and apparent military necessity tends to weaken, greatly, the force and moral power of the blockade.
Third. That when one party is allowed this liberty, various other parties earnestly claim and assert the same right and privilege.
Fourth. That an ample supply of goods for the Army, Navy, and citizens can at all times be introduced by the old and regular established Port of Beaufort, declared to be open by the President's Proclamation. A water communication (as well as railway) from Beaufort to Newbern can soon be opened inside of the blockade by Cone Sound, so that the facilities for transportation of supplies will be very good. On this point I have conversed with Admiral Lee, and he approves the suggestions made.
Other reasons can readily be given in relation to this matter, if necessary, but enough for the present.
In relation to that matter of the printing presses, I will say to you that it was expected at Washington City that such of them as had been abandoned or captured would be placed in my possession as Treasury Agent.
I am very confident that by giving the one at Newbern in the hands of an energetic and intelligent practical printer, all the military printing needed by this department can be done with more dispatch than at present, that a handsome income can be turned into the National Treasury and a sound Union paper published.
You see and know the want of a paper. It really seems strange that we have not had one before. In case one is established, errors may be committed in its management and those who do not appear to appreciate the potency of the press may doubt the policy of the experiment, but you readily comprehend the matter in all its moral, social, and political
bearings. Gen. Peck has already taken the matter under advisement, and given directions to have the presses alluded to placed under my control, with the understanding, of course, that the necessary military printing shall be done.
I do not propose to have any control over the paper intended to be started, but will see that the press here is rented to a sound Union man.
I submit these items to your present consideration, and will, from time to time, make further communications as the public interest may seem to require.
While on the cars you frankly asked my sentiments with regard to Maj. Genl. Peck. Allow me to repeat, earnestly, what I then said, that I consider him to be a man intensely devoted to the government and the Union, that he looks upon the rebellion as a crime of the blackest character, and that as a public man his firmness and integrity are beyond reproach, that he may not fully be indoctrinated with the policy of immediate emancipation, but that he will most faithfully and resolutely carry out the various proclamations of the President, and that I believe he will ere long occupy your own position as to the proper course to pursue with slavery. I must say, frankly, that I should regret to see Genl. Peck leave North Carolina.
With the warmest wishes that your advent into this Department may be crowned with complete success, I am,
Very respectfully, Your obt. servt.

Sir: James A. Gray, who claims to be a British subject and who has resided, according to his own statement, 15 years in Georgia, was taken on board the ""Ella and Annie,"" a blockade runner, and landed at Beaufort, N. C., came here with Mrs. Nickols and desired to be sent to Georgia. His baggage being examined, was found to contain a quantity of dress goods, which he said were for his wife and family there. On examining his papers, he had a large number of letters directed to persons in the South giving them information as to blockade running, and other information hurtful to the United States. I caused the letters directed to himself, found upon his person, to be examined, and a synopsis of their contents to be made. I also found that he carried out a large quantity of Confederate bonds, which he sold in Holland, and that his correspondent in Liverpool was the house of Fraser Trenholm & Co., who are known as the Head Quarters of blockade running, and are acting as Agents of the Confederate Loan. I also found a letter from James McHugh to him while at Cork, Ireland, engaging him to enlist sailors for the Confederate iron-clads. I also found Invoices showing a large amount of cotton in the Confederate States, some thousand bales to his order.
It is impossible to convey by synopsis the hostile tone of the whole correspondence, but there is sufficient to convince me that he is a dangerous enemy, and was intending to carry through our lines the same correspondence and information with which he was endeavoring to run the blockade when captured. Therefore I have turned him over to my Provost Judge for punishment and imprisonment if he finds sufficient in the accusation against him.
Gray desires leave to apply to Lord Lyons, and I forward this for information to the Department, that you may be able to meet the application. I have the honor to be.

Sir: There is a subject of importance which I desire to call your attention to, and hear your views. President Lincoln has excepted this section in his Emancipation Proclamation. Now, the question is, has a loyal person the right to hold persons as slaves in this section, or, how far will we be permitted by the military authorities to execute the laws of Va.?
I will candidly confess the slave law is odious to me, it is the law, and when a loyal person claims the services of their servants under those laws I see no way to evade the law as it exists.
The subject has frequently embarrassed me, and the only way I can avoid it is by the interposition of the military.
I am satisfied that the Legislature will take early action on the laws of Va., and so alter them as to recognize the status of the negro. I have attempted to avoid this question, but find it impossible, and therefore ask your opinion.

First, because when Virginia seceded from the Union in my judgment all her laws, acts, and ordinances went out with her, and cannot be set up until they are re-enacted, in any portion brought under the authority of the U.

Thirdly, there is no person in Portsmouth who has not been, directly or indirectly, implicated in the Rebellion, who has ever come to my knowledge, with a single exception.
The President's Proclamation of Dec. 9th determined that no party who has been so directly or indirectly implicated in the Rebellion, can have any property in slaves, and, therefore, you will direct the Mayors, both of Norfolk and Portsmouth, to cease and wholly refrain from interfering with the personal liberty of anybody upon the ground of slavery or involuntary servitude, until further orders.

Dear Harriet: We returned last Tuesday from a tour of North Carolina. You will be ready to exclaim that without any justifiable cause I should again dare Hatteras. I was weary of the sight of cleaning and furnishing. Blanche was teasing to go, the weather is settled and mild, so that I gave general orders to the servants what to do for a week, and started without more ado. This was Blanche's first voyage. I hoped she would take after her father, and would escape seasickness, but she seems to be her mother's own daughter, and droops at the first roll of the vessel. We landed at Beaufort, the same marshy, sunken, sandy look that most southern towns have. We did not land that night. In the morning
we took the cars for Newbern, thirty miles distant. All the remainder of the week we were sailing up the Pamlico and Albermarle Sounds, touching at the little towns we have taken and fortified at great labour and expense, that are of no earthly use but oblige us to feed and take care of the inhabitants. Little villages many miles asunder, they were taken merely to give éclat to Gen. Foster. The only place worth taking was Wilmington, and that we have not got. A description of one will answer for all.
One long street, over-arched with elms (bare of foliage now), short streets crossing it, with tumbled-down looking buildings on the outskirts, some few good-looking houses along the streets; but more a story and a half high, worn and ancient, little yards in front with pretty shrubs, that would hide the decay in summer-time and give a look of freshness and beauty to these flat, uninteresting places.
We were at Beaufort, Newbern, Little Washington, Plymouth, Roanoke Island, and out by Hatteras Inlet. You can trace it out on the map for the children. North Carolina seems to be all water. Mr. Crane will start for Lowell tomorrow, and offers to bring anything I may want. If you have the dress made I wish you would send it.
You did not buy the purple cloak; was it gone? The white one has not the silk border round the edge that was on the one I wish. What did you pay for it? I have not heard a word from home but Benny's dear little letter; it must have been great trouble for him to write it out so nicely. He must try again, and Paul, too, must send Mother a letter.
The day has been rainy, a part of it, but very warm. There are some roses blooming in the garden.
Mr. Butler thinks he will go to Washington in a week. If he does, I shall take Blanche back to school. We have Parton's book. I fear it is a failure. How would you like to come out here with the boys sometime this winter?"

Informal Convention between the Secretary of State of the United States, and the Envoy Extraordinary and Minister Plenipotentiary of His Majesty the Emperor of the French, on the Subject of the Exportation of Certain Tobacco
Whereas, by an Executive order, bearing date the 10th inst., a copy of which is hereunto annexed, the President of the United States has authorized the exportation of certain tobacco, it is hereby agreed that the exportation of such tobacco firm, within limits under blockade, shall be governed by regulations consisting of the following articles.
Article I
The vessels adapted to the employment shall be neutrals exclusively. They shall be French as much as possible, although foreign vessels of other nations may be employed by the French officers to assist in the operation.
Article II
The French Minister engages that the only tobacco to be removed is tobacco purchased and paid for prior to the 4th of March, 1861, and is in quantity about six or seven thousand hogsheads.
Article III
For the purpose of preventing any fraud, the charter party shall include express mention that the vessels freighted shall be under the immediate orders of the Commander of the ""Tisiphone,"" in everything that will bear upon the relations and communications to be maintained with the shore, as well as for the labor made necessary for loading. Mr. de Marivalt will, for this purpose, be authorized to detach on
board, if he shall judge it to be necessary, a guard of armed men, who shall be victualled under the care of the merchant captains, to whom the amount of the rations shall ulteriorly be re-imbursed in kind.
Article IV
The pilots taken by the merchant vessels ascending to City Point, shall, on their arrival, be placed at the disposal of the Commander of the ""Tisiphone,"" who will take measures needful to send them back in the same capacity on vessels going down, or as passengers on board of flag of truce vessels. In that case it will be proper to settle in advance with these pilots a compensation which shall be allowed them daily during their sojourn on board. It should be arranged that said passage shall be effected on the transmission of a pass issued by the French Commander.
Article V
It shall be formally stipulated in the charter party that the vessels ascending or descending James River shall not communicate with any one soever save the Federal cruisers, to whom they will have to show their clearances, and on their departure shall return directly to France, to such port as shall have been assigned to them.
Article VI
The vessels selected by the Consul of France for account of the Imperial Government shall carry whatever be their nationality from their arrival in the Chesapeake until their departure, the French flag at the foremast head.
Article VII
The steamer which shall tow the tobacco barges will carry the same flag in going to and fro.
Article VIII
To accelerate the loading, a gang of forty laborers shall be recruited at Norfolk, and placed at the disposal of the Commander of the ""Tisiphone,"" who will distribute them among the vessels that are loading, according to the wants of the hour. In case their number should be insufficient, and where it would be of advantage to join to them some of the crew of the ""Tisiphone,"" the parties loading shall be held to pay them daily wages, on the same footing as to the other laborers.
 -- 167  -- Article IX
The said laborers, considered as forming part of the effective crew of the ""Tisiphone,"" shall in no case communicate with the shore.
Article X
The people of the United States and those of some of the Southern States having interrupted their relations, and the progress of operations requiring that communications be opened between the Commander of the ""Tisiphone"" and New York, there shall be conceded from City Point to Fortress Monroe, and thence to New York, passage by the flag of truce to the officers of the Imperial Navy, provided with orders from Mr. de Marivalt.
Article XI
It is well understood that any intercourse between the crews of the vessels and the inhabitants of Virginia is rigorously interdicted.
Article XII
The chartered vessels will take, on leaving New York, independently of their ballast and provisions -- a quantity of staves, or other wood for dunnage necessary for solid stowage of their cargo.
Article XIII
In case some vessels should not be able from their draught of water to get up to City Point to load, they will complete it by dropping down to Harrison's Bar, where they shall be placed under the control of a French officer.
Article XIV
The administration of the Custom House at New York shall receive from Washington instructions, that the clearances of the vessels employed be not on its part the subject of any difficulty.
Article XV
The vessels chartered by the French Government shall be towed, or, as the case may be, convoyed by a French vessel-of-war from the mouth of the James River to City Point, and in like manner in descending.
In case where one or several of these vessels shall not find a turn at the mouth of the river, and that a steamer is about going up, if it can not tow or convoy them itself, it will advise
the French Commander of their arrival, so that he may go to seek them.
Two French Gunboats will be detailed to attend to this service. 1st -- The Corvette ""Tisiphone,"" Commander de Marivalt, 2nd -- Gunboat ""Grenade,"" C. A. Reynaud.
Article XVI
The time within which the tobacco may be removed in pursuance of the privilege granted by the order is five months from this date.

I will state for your information that I was negotiating for the renting of a plantation with a gentleman living within our lines, and a loyal man, at the time I received your first order, but had not consummated a bargain when I left for Fort Monroe.
After my interview with you I abandoned the idea of renting, but I have no power to turn it over to any one.
Immediately after returning from Fortress Monroe, I reduced the price of my goods, and have been sending them off about as fast as the force in my employ can handle them. My stock, however, is large, and I can dispose of them within the time allowed only by making sacrifices which I would
gladly avoid. I shall however unless the time is extended dispose of them at whatever sacrifice.
It will, however, be entirely beyond my power to settle up my business in the time named. I have debts due me at nearly every trading point in the Department, so scattered I cannot possibly see the parties. Again, I have supplied a good many poor citizens and refugees with small amounts to enable them to support their families. They can only pay in small instalments without bringing distress upon their families, which I can not think of doing.
Under these circumstances, I have to ask permission to leave my books and papers with my bookkeeper to close up what I may have unsettled at my departure. Under present circumstances, nothing could be more congenial to my feelings than to leave the Department at once. You may be assured I shall lose no time in preparing to leave at the earliest possible moment.

Sir: I acknowledge your letter of the 28th inst., containing a request for more specific information in relation to James A. Gray.
Gray states, upon his examination, that he had resided in Georgia for 15 years, that his wife and family still reside there, that he left the South, running the blockade, about the 10th of July, that he was captured in returning on board the ""Ella and Annie"" sometime in October, that his purpose was only that of a visit, his letters all showing an intention of returning to his home in Georgia, where he had property to a very large amount.
Since I wrote the Department, he has had a full hearing before my Provost Judge, for whose conduct of the case he expressed the highest gratification, and was sentenced to two years imprisonment at hard labor in Fort Norfolk for smuggling contraband intelligence into the South, a crime which, I suppose, is one irrespective of nationality.

Sir: I send you a copy of the record of the trial and sentences of privates Leach, Donnelly, and Flynn, who were to be executed on Monday. The time for which execution I have extended two weeks. The concluding reason with me in the cases of Donnelly, and Flynn, to order the execution was that
they were substitutes who had received their hire with apparently a deliberate intention of deserting. In the case of Leach, I was also led to approve the sentence because this was the second time he had deserted. As after the judgment of the Court Martial the cases had lain before General Foster for some time for his action, and as he had left them without any endorsement, I felt some delicacy in carrying the sentence into effect; therefore it is submitted to your judgment.

My dear Carter: I am most sorry you did not come down. I wanted to see you about the exchange of prisoners. It is a matter of vital importance. I am most deeply annoyed by the articles in the Herald and Tribune that I am in any way in opposition to the Secretary in this matter. I was laboring for his benefit. Now, the fact is, that an exchange can be made for negro troops and all until you come to the slaves actually enlisted from the rebel lines. The exchange of those involves a question of property by claimants of their own citizens against the Rebel Government, which that body cannot now afford to deal with. Therefore Ould, the Rebel Commissioner, had to say No when Meredith put the question to him, ""would he exchange all."" I know whereof I affirm, my dear Carter, when I say this. So certain am I of this that I am willing to risk this guaranty. If the Secretary of War will put at my disposal from Point Lookout one thousand or five hundred rebel prisoners, and I do not return to him the same number of our soldiers prisoners held by the rebels, and some negro soldiers or officers too, I will pay from my own pocket to the Government the cost of their transportation forward and back, provided if I succeed the Secretary will let me go on until I am stopped by the refusal of the rebels to exchange. Now, I make this to you as a friend of the Secretary -- a warm and true one, as I know you are, and for the purpose of relieving him from an embarrassment before the country brought on by the misconceptions and personal feelings of his subordinates.
If he could see and understand this question as I do I am sure he would agree with me. I am not permitted as a man of honor to state to him or to you the grounds of my belief -- but I do believe. No jot or tittle of the honor of the country shall fall in the transaction. On my head be it if it does. You must not show him this note, as it is written for your eyes alone. I am anxious to relieve him from the pressure, which in my place I see more of than any other, of the condition of these prisoners. It is strange, but would the Secretary think that my proposition would be put by General Meredith so that it should succeed when all his had failed? It was not in human nature.
Mrs. Butler sends regards, and desires to see you and Mrs. Carter here.

Dear General: I have had a long interview with the Colonel,
1 and I believe he is decidedly better; his spirits are good, which, you know, is half the battle -- he is willing to quit all business and do anything that is thought best. I see him again to-day, and I think my trip will do good.
The pistols for 20th New York cavalry were shipped 16th Nov., and delivered to Captain James, Quartermaster, where they are now, as I have seen B/L signed by him. There is a big ring connected with these gunboats, at the head of which is Greeley. Wiard has been in Washington, and came home this morning with a flea in his ear, having run against my report in the War Office. Graham has shipped carriages, launches, etc., for Foster, and has been looking around awaiting Wiard's return. He (Graham) says that the parties here talked to him as if there was no doubt about the boats being accepted. etc. I should have at once smashed the whole thing, but upon reflection I concluded that, all things considered, if the boats could be altered, machinery put in the hold, etc., and the boats completed in time at a fair price, we had better take them. I consequently gave Graham full power to accept them, if in his judgment they could be and would be made to answer in every respect the purpose for which we needed boats, and in good time and at a fair price. If not, he had full power to purchase such other boats as in his judgment could be speedily transformed into gunboats. I told him to show this order to Mr. Wiard, and I thought he would have things his own way. Graham has, I think, good judgment, and the result of my trip will be to change the boats at Wiard's expense to suit us, and give Mr. Greeley to understand that we cannot allow the government to be cheated. I return to-night to Washington, and will remain there a couple of days unless you telegraph me to hurry back.
Now, General, the more I think about that speech of yours the more I incline to the opinion I gave in my last letter. As I said, you should however know best what to do. Chase has his men hard at work. The Collector of this port is to be changed for Opdyke, all that can be is being done to strengthen Chase. I will write to-morrow from Washington.

I was not prepared to give him much information about the matter. He then told me that Mrs. Moore, a protégé of Senator Wilson, had a permit from the Secretary of the Treasury to take goods down there, establish a saw-mill, take goods from there, and do almost anything she pleased. That she had gone to Fortress Monroe to see you, that she might get your good wishes in the matter, though she already had her authority from Secretary Chase. Now, that there is something in this I have no doubt. How much I should like to know. That Mr. Chase gives permits in other Departments is certain, for the Pierce Brothers have a permit from him, or by his authority, to do business in Banks' Department, to take out butter, sugar, etc., etc.
Now, if Mr. Powers' friends, or others, desire to do business in your Department, must they apply to you or to Washington

I applied a few days since to the Department for power to appoint officers of such regiments as I should raise, and issue Provisional Commissions in the manner it was done in Louisiana by myself and General Banks. To that application I have received no reply. I am opposed to the policy of allowing Governors of States to have anything to do with the colored troops, as well as white ones.
I have believed it was best that the forces of the United States should be U. S. Troops, not New York, Massachusetts, or Pennsylvania troops. You may remember that it was on this point I had some trouble with my now very good friend, Governor Andrew. I should think it best that the President should commission all officers of colored troops, and if the rapidity of recruitment should throw a press of business upon the Adj. Gen'l's Office, Provisional Commissions could be issued by Commanders of Departments until the averages could be brought up. I particularly request that no more promotions to officers in colored troops in this Department should be made without prior information from these Head Quarters, as an order for promotion has already come down here for promotion of a man who is in the guardhouse for drunkeness and desertion, and he desires me to let him out for the purpose of taking his commission, with the promise that he will not do so again.

What I said to the Secretary was, if the service in the department of Virginia and North Carolina was the best he could do for me, to send me there; but that I had from the first been uniformly opposed to all operations on the coast except what was barely necessary to aid in enforcing the blockade. That to be a mere commandant of coast guard was not attractive to me, and to have more force than what would be necessary for this purpose was and had always been against my judgment.
I said that the closing of Wilmington was the only operation I thought this department offered, and that this would require a large force, larger than I could see would, or could, be furnished.
You were right in saying I have a great respect for General Butler's high qualities and abilities, and a sincere sympathy for him in all his operations, but I think he will be glad to know my antecedents and my present opinions with respect to the operations in the district he commands.
If you think General Butler may have received an impression at variance with the foregoing, I think it would be well to inform him, for I have a horror of being in a false position.

The rebels tried to destroy it, but the docks were so splendidly built of stone and solid masonry, the buildings of brick and iron, that they could neither burn or blast them altogether, but they injured a great deal that will take a long time to repair. Blanche looked on every side for a mocking-bird. We found two in a cage, hanging in the door of a house on the outskirts of the town. The owner said they would sell one, but we concluded to be sure of a fine singer and look further.
What is the reason Harriet does not write? We have not had a line from her since we left home five weeks or more ago. If any one is coming, send that piece of brown braid for Blanche's dress, to bind where the buttons have cut. You must make out a letter, Paul, but do not work too hard at it. A few lines will answer to tell me what you are doing and how much you love me.

Governor: My attention has been called to General Order No. 28, Series 1862, of the Executive of Massachusetts, under these circumstances.
That Order provides that recruits enlisting in three years' regiments will be discharged whenever their regiments are mustered out of the service. Now, the 23rd Reg. was mustered into service taking date Sept. 28th, 1861, of course to be mustered out Sept. 28th, 1864. In the summer of '62 large numbers of recruits joined the regiment, as they claim under said Order No. 28. They now claim that they are to be mustered out with the regiment, having less than a year to serve, and that therefore if they re-enlist they are entitled to the bounties of three years' men, having less than a year to serve. As the question involves one of the Orders issued from your Head Quarters, I have determined to submit it for your advice before I ask direction of the War Department. I send enclosed a copy of the Order furnished me, which please return. Awaiting reply. I have the honor to be,

My dear Sir: Yesterday Dr. Howe and myself returned from an expedition into Kentucky, Tennessee, and Missouri;

I am instructed by the Commission to express to you the unqualified pleasure and satisfaction which its appearance has afforded us. Disappointed as we have been that the Secretary of War, though he expressed to us in general terms his approval of the plan of organization proposed in our preliminary report, over-run probably by other business, has not authorized us to carry it out, we should be reconciled to its postponement did but the other Generals, commanding in the Department where refugee freedmen are found, adopt for their protection and improvement a system so comprehensive at once and so effective as that which you have embodied in your order. It will contribute more than any other similar document issued since the commencement of the war to the solution of one of the hardest problems that has arisen in the course of it.
May I ask that you will kindly cause to be sent to us (address as above) twelve copies, if you can spare them, of the order in question?
In case you should see fit to place them in the hands of your Superintendents, we send you a few copies of our report. I am, my dear Sir,

General: If I had had anything favorable to report relative to the commission with which you charged me, -- the proposition to Secretary Stanton through Mr. Watson, -- you would have heard from me a week ago. But the fact is, I found Mr. Watson so crowded with business that he could not even read my brief of the Hunt case, nor give me a half hour to talk about it. He said that he was satisfied to take whatever action I recommended -- and so he did. I rapidly stated your views respecting our prisoners and the proper cause to ensure their relief. He said he and the Secretary thought differently; that our men could do no better service to the country than to lie in Richmond; for, practically, they are keeping 40,000 to 50,000 rebel soldiers hors du combat; and, further, that you were in error in supposing that the proposition came from our side to exchange all for all. Something more of an irrelevant nature was said, but it is not worth while to repeat it; the main point is that Mr. Watson does not wish to interfere in the matter.
I pray you to accept my hearty congratulations for the issue of order about negroes. It places you where you deserve to be -- as a deep-thinking, practical statesman. We have had orders upon orders, treatises, speeches, letters, and debates from all our publicists; but the great question of the day has never been so boldly, dexterously handled before.
Will you please say to Major Bell that the Dept. take so much interest in the Hunt case that they want me to go to Fort Monroe, when the charge and specifications are ready, to look them over and give Major B. any suggestions which may seem necessary. He will therefore be so obliging as to let me know when he is ready. I have taken and am taking some more affidavits in the case and they will be transmitted forthwith.
My secretary is now at Syracuse looking for more evidence in the case of the third cavalry raid.
I telegraphed you to-day that I have found you a secretary. He comes well-recommended, and will no doubt suit you. I engage him at $125 per month (and one ration) so as to give you a margin of $25 to increase to as reward for fidelity. I

My dear Madam: I have received your letter and hasten to answer it.
I thank you much for the opinion which you seem to have entertained of myself and my services, and I do not mean to do anything to forfeit them, but I must do my duty.
Your husband, Col. McLean, came into this Department. Grave charges are made against him by the Special Agent of the Treasury Dept. What was it my duty to do? To detain him until those charges can be investigated, and forward the investigation by every means in my power.
I have done so. Had I desired to be either vindictive or cruel, or stony-hearted, I should have thrust him into close confinement, but I have ordered simply that he shall not leave Old Point, and he is boarding unmolested at the only hotel at the Point. If he is innocent, as I trust he is, no harm save a temporary detention will happen to him. If guilty, that will be ascertained by a fair trial, and such action taken as it is in my bounden duty.
From a letter of your father written to him, which has been forwarded to me, it would seem that that gentleman has not always had the confidence in him which he must have had when he gave him his daughter.
The charges do not affect specially his character for loyalty, or the fact that he is a Union man. The question turns on his probity and obedience to the laws. Both he, and yourself if you desire, shall have a full opportunity to meet all matters alleged against him. I was surprised to hear by your letter that he left home to be absent only two or three days, because in his application to me he desired to be permitted to go into permanent business at Newbern, which must have entailed a much longer absence.

A. Smith, a British subject, doing business in that place, on the ground that there was ""no authority to grant permits except to citizens of the United States.""
The ""Internal Trade Regulations,"" of Setember 11th require, (See. XXXII) that ""Applicants for permits to ship to any port or place affected by the existing blockade, but occupied by U.

In a previous case of this same Chas. A. Smith, referred to me in your letter of Sept. 11th, he already had his certificate from the military officer, and his difficulty was with the Collector, in Baltimore, who required him to take the oath of allegiance.

As this practice is productive of some inconvenience, I am directed by the Secretary to request that you will, hereafter, cause the rules to be observed by all applicants within your Department.

My dear Sir: You will see that a mistake has been made by the writer in Order No. 46, by the corrected copy which is forwarded. I had supposed that I had only organized the duties which had devolved upon you without any organization. As soon as we find the workings of it, for no legislation is good except it is founded upon experience, we will endeavor to get out a code of instruction under it.
I enclose your requisition for the saw and grist mill, and when you get it, and the bills, we will take measures to see that it shall be paid for.
In regard to your suggestion that the Quarter Master will not be able to load and unload vessels promptly, where soldiers are not needed in the field details can be made, and ""where there is a will there is a way.""
No Quartermaster will find it either for his profit or convenience to attempt to get in the way of the execution of that order by delaying the business of his Department. If the Quartermasters that are there cannot do their business, I have plenty of men who can.
Let Major Jameson forward to me such certificates and vouchers as he may, and I will take his matter into consideration.
I should be glad to confer with you personally when your duties will permit. Apply to me for any aid you may need at any time.
I have recommended that you be appointed Quartermaster, in order that you may have power to receive and disburse funds, and to stand upon an equality with the other superintendents of negro affairs. I have the honor to be,

The three enclosures herewith are respectfully returned. The Order No. 383 returned with them has no application to the subject, except to show that they ought to be acted upon at Washington. They are applications for leave of absence to visit Washington. The Commanding General has some appreciation of the effect of General Orders. He will grant leave of absence whenever it is in his power, and when in his judgment he deems it best. He believes he ought to have power when he deems it necessary to send an Officer to Washington.
General Orders, however, have determined otherwise, and to those I bow with every deference. Therefore, when leave of absence is asked of me to visit Washington, I forward them to the Adjutant General's office, or to the Secretary of War if I desire to add any special commendation."

Sir: Upon consultation with Col. Olcott about Strout's matter, it occurs to me that as most of his acts were committed before the Fraud Acts of March 3rd 1863, he being arrested on the 16th of March, he may be amenable to a Provost Court as a citizen in the employ of the Government, and acting falsely and fraudulently to his employer, -- to wit, the Government. If so, and he can be tried by a Provost Judge in the Provost Court of this Department, in which I have a very able Judge, strict justice will be done to him,
and that speedily. A Court Martial is a very unwieldly, troublesome, expensive, tedious, and sometimes inconclusive process, its members exposed to various influences which cannot be brought to bear upon an upright Judge, who knows and respects his position as Judge, to which he is accustomed.
I have no doubt of the matter myself, but it is a matter of some importance. Please suggest it to Mr. Whitting, Solicitor of the War Department, and, if you think best, to Judge Holt, so that if any revision or appeal is made to that Department, we may not find that we have proceeded ""in ops conscilliae.""
So much time will be saved and so much more satisfactory result will be arrived at, that I am myself very much in favor of this course.
I was accustomed to try in the Department of the Gulf, and I see by the papers that it is still the custom to try much more considerable cases with very great severity of punishment before that court, and there has been no disturbance of that process, or of those records, by any revising Officer.
While this point is being examined by you, we will lose no time, because the Prosecuting Officer will be employed in the necessary preparations.
Col. Olcott concurs in these views, and I would send him to Washington to represent them could I afford the time. Awaiting your reply, I have the honor to be,

Tell Aunt Harriet that everything is right, and mother is very much pleased with the satin skirt, it is trimmed very prettily indeed. There are to be two parties here Christmas, one is a mask ball, I believe, -- would you not like to go to it? Ask Aunt Harriet to describe one to you if you do not know what they are.

Yesterday Gen. and Mrs. Wistar came down from York Town to spend the day, and they finally decided to pass the night with us. About ½ past 6 a telegram came for the Genl., stating the bakery at York Town was on fire, and that they feared they should not be able to save the ordnance buildings (three in number) filled with powder and shell, from destruction. The Genl. was in perfect agony, he could not have reached Y-T before ten o'clock, and by that time the buildings would have been blown up, so he was obliged to content himself and hope for the best. At ten, another message came, saying that they had ""all blown up, and that the shells were bursting,"" which they continued to do during the night. Of course all the windows in the town were shaken out by the explosion, and these shells flying in all directions must have caused great destruction.
Father had sent for Genl. Wistar to come down to see about some prisoners, and it was the first night that he had been away from his command for eight months, he thought it quite hard that he could not have been there on that night of all others. Some of the men behaved nobly. One officer stood on the blazing roof of an ordnance building striving to
put out the fire, with hundreds of pounds of powder beneath him, ready to explode, and a sentinel who had his leg fractured by a shell, was found in the morning keeping guard standing on his knees. This was a great fire, Paul, and we could hear the explosion here, although York Town is 28 miles distance.
You must write soon again, and your letters will do for Christmas presents. Love to Aunt Harriet; tell her that mother is going to send for her and the children soon.

Sir: I am sorry to report that a very disastrous fire broke out in Yorktown in one of the hospitals, communicating thence to the bakery, within the Fort, and thence to the Ordnance building, which blew up, scattering the shell and fixed ammunition all over the Terreplein of the Fort, where it continued exploding during the night. A very high wind rendered all efforts to extinguish it unavailing.
All the buildings are more or less injured by the several explosions. Two of the service magazines were set on fire and exploded. Fortunately, we have suffered no loss of life, and but few wounded.
The soldiers and officers behaved on the trying occasion with great gallantry. On the conduct of some of them I will make honorable mention as soon as a detailed report is made. Most energetic measures will be taken to repair damages, and to supply the loss of ammunition which is not very great, as a large portion of the Ordnance stores, consisting of shells taken from the enemy, were not available.
This has drawn my attention to a state of facts existing at Old Point, which I desire your authority immediately to remedy. A large wooden building, used as a Naval Ordnance storehouse, containing many tons of Naval Ordnance Stores.
and fixed ammunition, stands immediately among the buildings, just outside of this Fort. Its situation, in event of fire in this neighborhood, as it is surrounded by wooden buildings, is very completely, correctly, and graphically described in the report of Capt. Farquhar, Chief Engineer, which is herewith appended.
I see no reason why these Ordnance Stores should not be at once removed to Gosport Navy Yard, where they are even more easy of access than here, and which, in its present condition, could not be very much injured by an explosion.
There are plenty of buildings there that can be easily fitted up for that purpose, and if authority is given me, with directions to the Naval Officer to remove them, I will employ a sufficient force to have the evil at once removed. Or perhaps, a building might be made at Newport News, or the Rip Raps, for that purpose. At any rate, it should not be where it is.
I have forwarded a copy of this report to the Secretary of the Navy, for his information.
I think the evil a great one, the danger not remote, and the necessity for action immediate. I have the honor to be,

Sir: Permit me respectfully to call your attention to a very considerable improvement, and at the same time saving to the Government, that may easily be made at this Fortress, and an addition to its efficiency in defence, by the introduction of gas for lighting it. The works may be got in either of two ways. I can find a responsible contractor who will put in the works, and all the fixtures and pipes, at his own expense, keeping an accurate account of the cost thereof, upon the condition that he may sell the gas to those that use it, and to the Government for its offices at the price that it sells for in the city of Boston, if he can have the contract privilege extended to him for ten years with the proviso that at any time during the ten years, or at its expiration, or whenever the Government shall wish to annul the contract, they can do so by taking the gas works at their cost and ten per cent interest for the time, after deducting all expenses of carrying on the same.
Or, the gas works may be paid for out of the saving of the Post Bakery, which belong, in form, to the post, although in fact to the various Regiments who have at times been stationed here, and a portion of the Army of the Potomac that were here on their way to the Peninsular. Those savings now amount at the present price of flour to over seventeen thousand dollars.
I do not believe that gas works need cost over twenty thousand dollars. The Government would make a large saving in the issue of candles in the public offices, and the casements could easily be made much more defensible by properly arranged gas lights. The parade ground, which is now, on cloudy nights, so dark that it is impossible to distinguish friend from foe, can be lighted, and the light-house may have a far more brilliant illumination at the price which is now paid for lighting the same imperfectly.

I have a remembrance of this case, the details after this lapse of time have escaped my recollection, but they are more impressed upon my memory than usual from the fact that I attempted to befriend Mr. Tripler, supposing him to be an honest man, which supposition was not correct.
Tripler obtained passes, copies of which are here, to go with his schooner across Lake Ponchartrain from New Orleans into the rebel territory, and to carry the cargo named; but upon examination it was found that he was smuggling large quantities of contraband goods outside of his permit.
I had many hearings in person with Tripler, in his endeavor to persuade me that the goods were not subject to seizure, but the facts were too apparent, and the case too agrant.
I remember one particular fact. He asked me for leave to take over a package of shoe thread, to allow the neighborhood shoe-makers to make shoes for the women and children, and his pass said, ""one case of shoe thread."" When his schooner came to be examined, he had a box of shoe thread, tightly packed, about four feet square, and containing enough to have sewed all the shoes in the Confederacy. His object was apparent, as the Rebels had a Shoe-Manufactory, at Jackson, upon the railroad, which came within eleven miles from where he could land with his schooner.
I therefore ordered them confiscated and sold, and the proceeds paid into the Provost fund, which I have no doubt was done, or being done when I was relieved from the Command of the Department of the Gulf.

Dear Sir: When I left Boston, your Committee assured me that at any time when I could find a place in which they might aid me in recruiting, by giving me those things which the Government did not provide for soldiers, I was to call upon your Society for their aid. That occasion has now arrived. You will see by Gen. Order No. 46, a copy of which I enclose to you, that I have directed the Superintendents of Negro Affairs to provide shelter and clothing as set forth in Article XI. Now, there is a large amount of clothing necessary for women and children, either new or second-hand, specially underclothing of warm description, to supply the families of those who have enlisted with us here, for the very rapidity of the enlistments has brought a burden upon us which we cannot at once answer. As soon as it is possible to get the matter organized, I think the labor of the negroes, with the savings of their earning, will be sufficient to meet these expenses, but at present we are not able so to meet them. I am very anxious to fulfill my part of the contract to the negroes, who by their readiness to enlist are fully up on their side. If, therefore, your society will procure, or purchase as large amounts as possible of clothing such as I have indicated, and send it to my care, marked on behalf of the negroes, I will
see to it that proper accounts are kept of it, and that it shall be well distributed, and I have no doubt that in this way much more aid to recruiting can be given them than by an equal expenditure in any other. I promised to write your Committee my ideas of the wants and necessities of the negro, but I have put forward a system in Gen. Order 46 which it is hoped will meet those wants, and a perusal of that Order, copies of which I take leave to enclose, will substantially exhaust any thought of mine upon that subject.

Dear Sir: On reflection, I am decidedly of the opinion that no native white inhabitant of Roanoke Island possesses at once the capacity and integrity to work shad fisheries for the government and the interest of the negro. The White islanders had rather not see our colony succeed. A northern man whose heart was in the movement would do better. I could put him into communication at once with parties both white and colored who would aid his work and supply all his needs. The negroes perfectly understand the modus operandi of the
shad fishing, and only need some one to ""boss the job,"" bring seines, salt, boats, et cetera.
At Plymouth, which is also an excellent place for this fishing, Major Elijah Willis, formerly Mayor of the town, and as good a Union citizen as is left there, used to follow this business, and did so by permission last season.
Aaron Gaylord, a very capable black man of that place, knows all about it also. A person going from the north for that purpose could easily superintend operations at both those points, they are so accessible to one another.
Reeds are not abundant, or large, at Roanoke Island, but in the swamps that line Roanoke River they grow profusely. But here it is more difficult to obtain them in quantities on account of the presence of guerillas. They are cut with a sharp hook on the end of a pole, tied in bundles the size of one's body, from 8 to 12 feet long. The negroes cut and deliver them at the Plymouth landing for $2.50 per cord.

Two Union Officers escaped from Richmond and traveled across the country into our lines. One was badly wounded in the eye, of course without clothes, and without money. I clothed them, so as to make them decent to appear in Washington, and sent my Aide-de-Camp to ask your clerk to give them a state room on board the boat, which he did by our paying for it, which we did:

The City of Norfolk has been in darkness long enough, waiting for the action of the enemies of the country. The mere fact that at this day they have taken the Oath of Allegiance, is no reason why the military necessity of having the city lighted should not be carried out. You will therefore, for military purposes, seize the gas works and their fixtures, and use the most energetic measures to put the thing in operation forthwith. I will send you to-morrow a competent man to take charge of it.

Major: In answer to your inquiry as to the occasion for reporting Joseph M. Bell, Major and Asst. Adjt. General appointed Nov. 7th, 1863, as an Aide-de-Camp upon my staff, I have the honor to reply, that at the time of Major Bell's appointment I asked the Secretary of War in person, and he called upon Col. Hardie at the time that he might be notified of it, for permission to assign Major Bell to any duty which I thought he was best fitted for. Now, Major Bell is Provost Judge, and the best one in the United States within my knowledge. I believe that that Officer, sitting in the place of the Commanding General, to investigate cases which his time and other duties will not permit him to do, should be a staff Officer and in the relation of Aide-de-Camp, and therefore I announced him as such, in order that as Asst.

My dear Boutelle: You will find enclosed a letter from a dear friend of yours in Richmond. I am informed by the bearer that Miss Van Lieu is a true Union woman as true as steel. She sent me a bouquet, so says the letter carrier.
Now, I much want a correspondent in Richmond, one who will write me of course without name or description of the writer, and she need only incur the risk of dropping an ordinary letter by flag of truce in the Post Office at Richmond, directed to a name at the North. Her messenger thinks Miss Van Lieu will be glad to do it.
I can place my first and only letter
1 in her hands for her directions, but I also place the man's life in her hands who
delivers the letter. Is it safe so to do? Will Miss Van Lieu be willing to either correspond herself or find me such a correspondent? I could pay large rewards, but from what I hear of her I should prefer not to do it, as I think she would be actuated to do what she does by patriotic motives only.
I wish therefore you would write me, confidentially -- and as so much is depending, in the strictest secrecy, what you think of the matter. Of course you will readily see that I can furnish means by which a very commonplace letter on family affairs will read very differently when I see it.

Sir: Your letter of Nov. was received by your son Thos. Stafford, Co. ""A,"" 24th Regt. Mass. Vols.
You are quite right in supposing that I would see that justice was done to your son. It shall be done. But the difficulty is, that you labor under misinformation from him, and if the falsehoods in his letter to you are any indication of his general character, he will not get punishment enough.
I have had the matter investigated. It appears that your son was tried by Court Martial for insubordination and drunkenness, found guilty, and sentenced to hard labor at Fort Macon, with forfeiture of pay and allowances for the remainder of the term of enlistment, which sentence was approved by
Major General Foster. But even that severe punishment seems not to have brought him to a proper sense of his duty, as you will see by the report of the Commander of the Post who has him in charge, a copy of which I forwarded to you, that on the 26th of Feb. he assaulted a negro, and on the 27th of June refused to do his duty, and had still to be further punished.
So far, justice has been done. But there has been one injustice done him. By the terms of his sentence he forfeits all pay and allowances during the remainder of his term of enlistment. That is, from 26th of Sept. 1862. He has a right to his pay prior to that time, and the balance due up to the 26th of Sept. will be ordered to be paid him. I have the honor to be,

In accordance with your request, I submitted the question to the Judge Advocate and Solicitor, with the result indicated in a note from Mr. Whiting saying.

They think that military offenders should be tried by a Court Martial, violators of police regulations by a Provost Judge, and all other offenders by a Military Commission.
The Secretary of War remarked that as the Judge Advocate and Solicitor had given an opinion adverse to the jurisdiction of a Provost Judge, in this case it would be well enough to follow their recommendation, although there need be but little apprehension of his reversing any decision against swindlers on the ground of incompetency of the tribunal before whom they may be convicted.

Sir: I find by Richmond papers that at a meeting of the tobacco brokers in Richmond it was, among other things, unanimously resolved that the Confederate Government be requested not to permit any tobacco to be shipped by the French Government, because the United States Government had made it a condition that all the tobacco owned by French subjects had been purchased prior to March 4th, 1861, while, as the meeting resolved, to their certain knowledge all the tobacco had been in fact purchased since March 4th, 1861.
I am inclined to give more credence to this story because there was a Frenchman in New Orleans, claiming to be an agent of the French Government. purchasing tobacco during the summer of 1862, which I suppose will appear at Richmond to be shipped through our lines to France as a part of the tobacco purchased by the French Government previous to March 4th, 1861. I have also information, from a source upon which I rely, that Monsieur Paul, the French Consul, was, when he passed through our lines, the bearer of letters and despatches from the Confederate Government, or its officers, to Parties in Europe.

Sir: Upon the reception of your petition in behalf of your clients Bidgood and others, I immediately referred the same to Maj. Jos. M. Bell for a report of the facts as they appeared at the trial, and have the honor to forward a copy of his report.
The evidence certainly puts a very different phase upon the offences of these men from that stated in the petition.
It seems that they organized a riot, broke into a negro's house, beat his wife with a table leg and carried him off, an old man, into slavery, lying about it by saying that they were going to carry him to the Yankees; and you claim that these men are the most respectable citizens of the country.
If these facts were true, and I must take them to be true upon the report of the Judge, I only regret that he did not add a ball and chain as part of the punishment.
Lawlessness, by even ""the most respectable people of the country,"" must cease within the reach of the military authorities of this Department.
The deplorable ignorance of these criminals sufficiently justifies Judge Bell in the leniency with which he regarded their crime, one of the highest known to any law, and so far from intending by any action of mine to lighten their punishment, I am much tempted to add to it, that they shall be kept in imprisonment at hard labor until Steve Williamson, their victim, is returned from slavery, and you advise with them whether it will not be more for their comfort and convenience to have Williamson returned to his home before the three and six months expire, to which they are sentenced by Judge Bell, as I take the question under advisement whether after their term of punishment expires they shall not be held as hostages for his return.
I have examined the question with reference to the plea you set up of the pardon in the President's Proclamation. If I could see any evidence that these men did this as any act directly or indirectly in aid of the Rebellion, except perhaps too remotely, all riots and kidnapping may be said to be in aid of that great crime, it would seem to me that they might come within the terms of that pardon. But, as far as I am advised, the pardon does not reach them. I therefore return you your petition with the enclosures, directing that you make the report of Judge Bell and this letter a part of any application to the President for pardon of the offences of your clients.

Dear Sir: Your favor of the 18th addressed to me is received this morning, but it contains neither the General Order No. 46 which you refer to, nor the memo. of clothing desired.
At our committee meeting to-morrow your communication will be laid before the General Commanding. We are just now much occupied in helping to fill the quota of Mass. by raising a cavalry regiment of blacks. Cannot you help us by sparing a few of your light weights, upon our helping you to take care of the families which prove such heavy weights?
We find no great difficulty in getting negroes, but it seems absurd to take men from their well-paid industry and comfortable homes in the free states, when our state bounties could get men accustomed to the Southern climate and afford relief to their suffering families.
The great difficulty in bringing the men here is that once
out of the military lines we cannot control them, and the land sharks steal them away for their bounties. The true thing would be to let us enlist them in the rebel districts.
We need the help of your influence at Washington to do this unless you can, under a military necessity, send us a transport-load of negroes, who have signed an article before leaving, and can be landed at Long Island! I suppose this might be irregular, and need some straining of the letter of the law, but perhaps you will take the responsibility. With great respect, I am,
Your obdt. Servt., J. M. Forbes, Chairman"

There is also a large quantity of pork and cattle constantly being taken to Richmond, Va. Wheat and corn are also taken to the same place.
He states that a large quantity of salt is being made about Deep Creek by James R. Ball and H. Dallman, at Belle Isle, and Robert Mitchell at the head of Deep Creek. All these works are on Deep Creek, Rappahannock River. James Webb has a ferry near Carter's Wharf; also another ferry is kept at Union wharf. These ferries have scows built large enough to carry several loaded wagons at a time. The Rebel cavalry previously spoken of, appear in the uniform of the United States in order to deceive Union People. This man further states that there are many men hiding in the woods from the cavalry company. There is also a large amount of grain in the above-named counties, sufficient to supply Lee's rebel army. There are several tanneries near Fairfax C. House. Sam'l Downey keeps one and another is kept at Union Village. The scows are kept closely concealed when any gunboats are in sight. There is a large amount of fine-cut ship timber at Mordica Creek, a little above Deep Creek. There is a quantity at Chase's mill, which in up Mordica Creek.
The colored man helped to cut the timber, and he is familiar with Richmond, Lancaster, and Northumberland Counties. He says he will act as a guide to any force that may be sent into these counties. He is at present on board of the Smith's Point Light Vessel.

Hon. E. M. Stanton, Sec'y. of War
Sir: I have received a letter by your direction from General Canby, in regard to General Order No. 46, directing me that the Engineer Officer at this Fort is not to be disturbed by reason of anything in that Order. There has been no occasion for any disturbance of the Engineer Department in consequence of Paragraph 5 of that order, which I wish to call your attention to. Of course you cannot desire that the Engineer Officers of the Department should pay more for labor than the price at which it can be procured; and at the present time there is a great surplus of colored labor which can be procured at $10 per month and rations. You will perceive by the Order that I have made provisions for skilled labor at a higher rate, so that in practice the Officer has only to certify that a given
laborer is a skilled laborer, in order to employ him at any rate of wages which his conscience will permit.
At this Post the substantial employment of the Engineer is building Fort Wool at the Rip-Raps, late Fort Calhoun which was begun in 1819, and will not be finished during your life or mine.
Not a gun is yet mounted upon it, and it may be well doubted whether the millions spent upon it will not be wasted, because the granite blocks of which it is composed have never been submitted to the test of the immense weight and power of the modern projectiles. Immediately upon the issue of my Order, almost every Officer of the Staff in this Department, who had favorite negro laborers in his employ at very high rates of wages, became alarmed and seemed determined to keep them, and therefore arose the cry, ""Great is Diana of the Ephesians."" There is at least one negro employed in the Engineer Department at a cost exceeding the rate fixed by Congress, who has been so employed for at least thirty (30) years, and I found in my Quarter Master Department almost seven hundred (700) negroes employed to do the work which I think could be done with three hundred (300). Now, if you desire that I should attempt to correct any of the abuses of the Department, I beg leave to suggest that whenever complaints of my action come to you from officers of the Staff Department, or others, you will do me the favor to ask for a report on the complaint, and then I shall be only too happy to most cordially submit to your judgment. Be assured that I will see to it that nothing happens to the Engineer Department here which shall impair its usefulness or efficiency. I have the honor to be,

Lowell, December 24th, 1863
Friend General: The quota of Massachusetts Volunteers is being very slowly filled. About 400 out of the 3300 for
Boston have been raised, Lowell has raised one-half of her number. The towns on the Cape are worse off than any other part of the state. Brought up on the sea, every available man has enlisted in the Navy. But one conscript from Barnstable county went to the war. The rest were exempted as disqualified, two or three paid commutation. They are willing to raise a large amount of money in addition to State bounty, equal to from $50 to $100 per man. Their agent has been to see Gov. Andrew, who approves of the agent's plan, which is something like this. The men are not on the Cape. Money can be raised for recruiting purposes and placed in their Agent's hands, who furnishes the men and takes the money. He has been to see Hildreth and myself, and wishes to ascertain whether or not negroes from your vicinity can be supplied to make their quota.
Gov. Andrew says that whatever men can be obtained there shall be counted for the town obtaining them, and be furnished the state bounty as if enlisted here. I don't know whether this is practicable, or how it will affect your recruiting.
The State will pay the bounty. No towns will pay the recruiting agent. Probably $100,000 extra can be had for 1000 men in addition to bounty. Would the bounty enable you to get men, that otherwise would not enlist? In one view it is tantamount to offering a bounty to men to enlist, where now you can pay no bounty.
The bounty might constitute a fund to take care of the families of those who enlist. Gov. Andrew is raising a Negro Cavalry regiment of 1200 men. The enlisting negro could go into that, or join any old regiment.
I promised the Agent that I would write to you. He says that he opened the scheme to the Governor, and he approved of it and will give it his aid. Can it be done? Will you allow it to be done? What is the best way to do it?
The men must be raised in some such way. They are not there to be drafted or to volunteer. I told these men that I should have a reply by Tuesday. Please give this matter some attention.
Your family, the part at home, are well, except that on last Saturday and Sunday Harriet had another of her pleurisy fit of pains, such as Blanche remembers. Mrs. Webster went up to the house and stayed a night or two, and brought her on to her feet again.
Your boys were at my home on Thanksgiving, and I believe
my boys repay the visit by spending Christmas with them. So expect to hear of broken glass and china ware.

Hon. Robert Ould, Commissioner of Exchange of the Confederate Authorities
Sir: I send by Major Mulford, Asst. Commr. of Exchange, 502 Prisoners of War from the Confederate Army from Point Lookout. All I believe serviceable, and substantially those longest there in confinement. I offer them for delivery at City Point upon condition of receiving the same number of men held by your authorities as Prisoners of War from our Army, leaving all questions of difference in controversy between your authorities and my Government for the present in abeyance.
I have made personal examination of the condition of the Prisoners of War of the Confederate Army now in prison at Pt. Lookout, and beg leave to assure you that they are as well cared for and in as comfortable a condition of good health, and as well fed, as the soldiers in our Army. I will send you in my next communication the statement of the Sergeants, Confederate Prisoners, who have charge of the several Cook-Houses upon that subject.
I do not mean to say that their ration is as large as our regularly-issued ration, because of their state of entire inactivity. But it is in every respect of the same quality as those issued to the men guarding.
If you have any doubt of it, upon an examination of the condition of the men I send you, and upon hearing their statement, please suggest what in your judgment should be done further in their behalf. I have made this examination and statement to you in order that you may be able to satisfy the friends of the prisoners who may be disturbed by the unfounded reports of ill-treatment and cruelty suffered by the prisoners at Pt. Lookout, in like manner as our people are excited by what I hope are like groundless stories of ill-usage and starvation suffered by our soldiers in your hands.
I find there are some of the wounded from Gettysburg, and some have been sick that are convalescent, and some so far disabled by sickness that while they may be sent forward for exchange they will probably be of no use or further service in the field.
Men without arms and legs and debilitated by sickness are certainly unfit to bear the necessary hardships incident to a condition of Prisoners of War. Besides, they encumber our hospitals. As upon examinations I did not think it proper to order them into the Prisoners Camp with wounds freshly healed, and health hardly restored, and perhaps as the hope of seeing their friends might have a beneficial influence upon their health, therefore I suggest that in the next transport I send up as many of those as are entirely able to bear the exposures of travel without probable danger to their health, and that in exchange you will return to me an equal number of our soldiers that may be in like condition.
As it may be inconvenient and prejudicial to their health to transship these invalids on either side, I will have men put upon a separate boat, upon which there shall be nothing but provisions for them, and will direct that the boat be put at your disposal at City Point to carry them immediately to Richmond, and bring back those that you shall give in exchange.
Of course you will transfer, if you think best, the Master and crew of the boat to the Steamer ""New York,"" which will accompany them, and will remain at City Point, and put your own Master and Crew on board until the boat is returned.
I need not suggest the necessity of care that the boat, which is but a hired transport, shall receive no damage while in your charge, for which my Government will be responsible.
And I further suggest whether the same means of avoiding transshipment might not be a convenience, and facilitate in making further exchanges of well men as well as invalids.
I also send four Officers, lately captured at Charles City Court House, and a Surgeon. One in exchange for Capt. Irvine, who was sent down by last boat, one at his urgent request, suffering from injuries, and two others for whom you will forward me my Officers of equal rank.
I send these though lately captured, because I have no Officers short of Johnson's Island, and I wish to avoid delay. Also a number of other prisoners whom I understand were exchanged long since, but by some oversight were not forwarded
until now, I trust such oversight will never happen again. I have the honor to be,

Sir: On Thursday last, in compliance with your order by telegram, I went to Point Lookout, made a full inspection of its locality as a Prison Camp, the means of retaining the prisoners within and defending it from any attack without, and also the condition of the prisoners there confined, and made inquiry into the general administration of the affairs in that district.
Immediately upon receiving your suggestion of possibility of rescue, I sent the army gunboat, ""Gen. Jessup,"" to report to General Marston, and also a very efficient light Battery.
I am advised that Point Lookout is one of the best situations, and with sufficient capacity to retain and control all prisoners that we have, or are likely to have, in our hands.
It is entirely defensible owing to its situation, with much less than the present force guarding it, against the attack of the whole of General Lee's army.
I found the prisoners well-fed, perfectly well sheltered as regards tents, and sufficiently clothed. I send appended a memorandum of a conversation, reduced to writing by my phonographic clerk, and afterwards sworn to by the six Confederate prisoners who were Sergeants of the Cook houses. It will be observed that their statement is a complete answer to all slanders against the management of the prisoners.
I found that the internal administration of the post had been very satisfactorily carried on by Brig. General Martson, who deserves great credit for his efficiency and economy. But I think the external arrangements are exceedingly expensive.
All the supplies, whether Quartermaster's or Commissaries', are furnished from Washington, so that bread and forage are first to be carried by Point Lookout to Washington, and then brought back, and delivered at Point Lookout.
That necessitates the running of a steamer daily between
Point Lookout and Washington. I shall take leave to alter the arrangement as to supplies and furnish the supplies directly from Baltimore or New York, to be landed at Point Lookout without any trans-shipment.
I also propose that the steamers of the Bay line, running between Baltimore and Fortress Monroe, as they pass Point Lookout each way on their route, shall stop there for mail matter and passengers, so that communication between that Point and Washington will be twice as frequent as at present, and every day between Fortress Monroe and that Point, and, that, too, without any additional expense to the Government, and the saving of the steamboat upon the Potomac.
I have written to the Postmaster General so to arrange the mails. This will relieve the services of one steamer plying on the Potomac River.
I find that there has been the sum of $65,000 in cash saved from feeding the prisoners, over and above the allowance. I propose to use such portion of that fund as may be necessary for the purpose of furnishing facilities of transportation in exchange of prisoners, which are now chargeable to the Quartermaster's Department.
I have taken five hundred prisoners from Point Lookout and sent them to City Point by flag of truce, as opening of exchange, and I expect to be able to telegraph you by the time you receive this report of the success of the experiment, and I will then report at length the correspondence between Mr. Ould and myself upon the subject of exchange.
I have sent none away that did not desire to go. I am informed that large numbers of the prisoners would volunteer in our service if thought proper, and to that I see no objection. I have the honor to be,

Sir: I am informed that certain persons claiming to be friends of the United States and a portion of the military forces of the United States, having been recruited in North Carolina, have organized themselves at Barcoes Island, lower end of Camden County, and that they are there in an unorganized manner without officers, and making excursions into
the country making captures and doing acts that should only be done by regular military organizations.
Please investigate the matter thoroughly, and report to me the exact condition of these men. If they or any of them, enlisted in the forces of the United States are there without Officers, have them sent to the forces to which they belong. If there is any Officer in charge, have him report to these Headquarters at once through the Commander under which he has acted. I have the honor to be.

Referring to my telegram of this date, in regard to the steamer ""Burnside,"" I enclose a copy of an informal contract drawn up between an authorized officer of this Department and Mr. Norman Wiard, of New York. I think it covers all that we desire in that class of boats and ordnance.
I have thrown the agreement into form, and enclose you a copy which, if you sign, Mr. Wiard will be prepared to sign, and the whole matter will be bound.
In regard to the time, you will see the agreement is not of much consequence so far as the ""Burnside"" and ""Foster"" are concerned, but it is well enough to have it signed to hold Mr. Wiard. As to the ""Reno"" and ""Parks,"" if it suits you, please sign it, and of the date of 7th Dec., and forward it in duplicate for Wiard's signature.
I send you a copy of a report to-day to show the use we can make of these gunboats. I have the honor to be,

Hon. Sec. of War
Acting upon the instructions sent me from the department, I forwarded to City Point 505 prisoners, officers and soldiers, accompanied by a letter proposing an exchange of all the prisoners actually held in custody, holding in abeyance all other questions relating to the subject between this Government and the Rebel authorities, upon the belief that a fair, honorable, and just proposition of exchange of prisoners actually in custody would be accepted, leaving other questions of difference to be adjusted by other negotiations. With this in view, I was careful that nothing should appear in my note which could be made either a cause or pretext for offence. The result has been that 520 prisoners of war held by the Confederates have been sent back in exchange, and the information afforded, being at the Assistant Agent of Exchange, by a letter from Robert Ould Confed. Comm'r of Exchange -- which is enclosed,-- which asserts in substance that unless the U. S. give up every claim which they have made in behalf of their soldiers who are prisoners of war, consent to sacrifice the colored soldiers this Government has enlisted, turn over their officers to the cruel punishments imposed by the pretended law of the Confederate Congress, and last, and much the least, consent officially that the person to whom the Government has entrusted the command of this Department shall be executed immediately upon capture, and that he and all officers serving under him shall be excluded from all the benefits of the laws which regulate civilized warfare, and from even the privilege of communication by Flag of Truce, for such is the tenor of a proclamation from Jeff Davis under which they shelter themselves, that no exchange can be effected, while our soldiers, prisoners in their hands, are to be maltreated, starved, ironed, or hanged, as suits their caprice. There is but one way, it seems to me to meet this question, and that is by the strnest retaliation."

Col. Biggs, Chief Quarter Master
I HAVE examined the communication of Capt. R. C. Webster as to the occupancy of certain buildings in Newbern for the use of his Staff Department, and also his correspondence with the special Agent of the Treasury, requesting permission from him to take and use the buildings.
The whole correspondence seems to me to proceed upon a mistake of rights and duties. All property in the Rebel States occupied by our forces is to be taken first -- for the use of the Army in its several Departments if needed, and of that necessity the Officers of the Army are the only judges. When any property is not needed by the Army, it is to be turned over to the Treasury Agent, and in that case only. If afterward any of that same property is needed by the Army, it is to be retaken because of the necessity which requires it, and not because of the permission of the Agent of the Treasury. These Agents are to ask the Officers of the Army what they will turn over of the property seized and held by the Army to the Treasury; not the Officers of the Army to ask the Agent what of the property captured the Army may be permitted to use for military purposes. Therefore, if a building or any other property captured and held by the Army is needed for military purposes, it will be taken whether it may be at the time in the hands of the Treasury Agent or not. Of course, I do
not mean by this that any Officer shall take anything not necessary for military use, and if he misjudge upon the question of necessity you will listen to any complaint concerning any abuse in your Dept. in that behalf.
Any collision with the Treasury Department would be especially undesirable, because we are all servants of one Government, striving, it is to be presumed, to do each his duty in his respective sphere.
A light examination and reflection upon the Act of Congress authorizing the appointment of these Agents would, it seems to me, prevent all danger of such collision. The Act provides solely that the Agents shall gather up such captured, abandoned, and scattered property as the Army does not want, and return the proceed thereof into the Treasury. And the Treasury Agents have no other rights and duties, and I am sure that the Hon. Secretary of Treasury would claim no other for them. You will forward this note to Captain Webster for his guidance, and ask him to hand it to Maj. Gen. Peck, Comd'g District of North Carolina, for his information.

Head Quars. Dept. Va. and N. C., Fort Monroe, Dec. 29th, 1863
Brig. Gen. James Barnes, Comd'g at Norfolk, Va.
General: I have received your communication of the 24th Dec. to A. T. M. Cooke, Esq., chairman of the stockholders' meeting of the Norfolk Gas Company, covering the letter of Mr. Cooke to yourself relating to the taking of the Norfolk Gas Works by the Military Authorities of the United States, and beg that you will forward him this communication in reply. Mr. Cooke claims for the Gas Light Company that they possess very valuable works, for which they now claim large compensation from the Government; that the majority of the stockholders have duly conformed to the requirements of General Order No. 49, and that the Company were about putting the works in order when they were taken by the Government for military purposes in violation of the constitutional rights of the Stockholders.
It will be observed, first, that until within a few days a majority of these stockholders have acknowledged being and been known as having been in rebellion against the Government
of the United States, and having endeavored to overthrow that Constitution about which they now so glibly talk, and have only just now taken the oath of allegiance to that Government which they have sought to destroy, in conformity to the requirements of a Military Order. And even now, under these peculiar circumstances, with the oath fresh in their mouths, in a communication from the stockholders to the Agents of the Government, with their claims of newfledged rights frequently repeated, the word loyalty or allegiance to the Government never finds place. They say they have conformed to the requirements of General Order No. 49. That Order requires of them nothing, and more than one of them have said, as I am informed and believe, that they took the oath to save their property, and that they claim not that they are loyal, but that they have taken out a protection. Such men, loyal with lip service only, so far as I am concerned, have few constitutional rights which I feel much inclined to respect. When they become loyal in heart as on lip, and speak of taking the Oath of Allegiance to their Country not as a requirement but as a duty, it will be time enough to discuss their constitutional rights. If their property is as valuable as they claim it, why have the Company left it to go to ruin for many months, without any attempt on their part to put the gas works in operation and light the city? Did their rebellious proclivities overcome even their love of gain, so that they were willing to sacrifice their property rather than to aid the United States by lighting it, in protecting their city from the robber, the burglar, and the incendiary? Is it not true that they have refused the Military Authorities of the United States, more than once, to light the city, and continued in that refusal until after they were informed that the works were to be seized upon for that purpose, and the Government had incurred expense in that behalf? I should be quite inclined as an act of justice to promise in the future monthly average rent equal to what they have received for the past nine months, as a compensation from the Government for the use of their works.
Their Chairman talks of the economical management of the Company as compared with the prospective management of the Government, and he certainly ought to be quite satisfied if he is assured from the Government the same rent which he has received under his own management.
Exactly what will be done is this. The works will be put
in repair more economically by twenty per cent than the estimate which was made for the Company for the repair of the works. They will be carried on efficiently and economically, so that the City of Norfolk will be fully lighted, and its peace and quiet in the darkness of the night be assured, until it is made certain that in case of an attack upon the City of Norfolk, the Rebel proclivities of the owners will not leave the city in darkness as a means of impairing the defense made by the United States forces; and when the owners have by their works and not by their lips convinced the military authorities that they can rely upon their loyalty for aid in repelling an invasion of the Rebels, and keeping up of the works to aid us in that behalf, then and not until then will the works be returned to their custody.
In the meantime, accurate accounts will be kept of the receipts and expenditures, and the excess of profits, which no doubt will be considerable, will be paid to those who are loyal, in the sense of the word as understood by loyal men. You are at liberty, General, if you please, to cause this communication to be published for the information of other citizens, if any in Norfolk, who stand in a like case. I have the honor to be,
Very respectfully yours,

Graham, for the purpose of making an attempt upon the shipping and blockade runners in the harbor of Wilmington, and if necessary upon the town.
Of course the success of this enterprise will depend upon the boldness of the attempt, the rapidity of its execution, and it is not unattended with serious risk; all of which has been weighed.
I propose that the ""Brewster"" shall attempt to run in past the batteries at Fort Caswell, under the guise of a blockade runner. She will then proceed up to the town and do the work for which she is prepared. More effectually to disguise her from the enemy, I wish you would cause some of the blockading fleet to chase her in upon a favorable opportunity, to be sought for and designated by General Graham. The ""Spaulding"" will lay off for the purpose of rendering her assistance upon her return, or her boats' crews, in case she is lost.
I have directed Ensign Harris to pay special attention to the iron-clads within the harbor, if there are any there.

for the service, and I believe it is not otherwise known outside of some member of my personal Staff. Of course I need not add a word of caution as to the necessity that the expedition shall remain a profound secret.

Sir: I have the honor to report that General Wild was despatched by my order upon an expedition with two Regts. of Colored Troops into the North Eastern Counties of North Carolina.
Our navigation on the Dismal Swamp Canal had been interrupted, and the Union inhabitants plundered by the Guerillas.
General Wild took the most stringent measures, burning the property of some of the officers of Guerilla Parties, seizing the wives and families of others as hostages for some of his negroes that were captured, and appears to have done his work with great thoroughness, but perhaps with too much stringency. The effect has been, however, that the people of Pasquotank, Currituck, Camden, Perquimous, and Chowan Counties have assembled, and all passed resolutions similar to those which I enclose, which were passed by the inhabitants of Pasquotank County, and three of the counties have sent committees to me with their resolutions.
These resolutions are signed by 523 of the inhabitants of the County, the average vote being eight hundred. Every prominent man, I am informed by the committee who presented the resolutions, that has not signed them has left, and gone across the lines. The Guerillas have also been withdrawn from these counties, to the relief of the inhabitants.
I have promised the Committees of the several Counties that so long as they remain quiet, keep out the Guerillas, and stop blockading running they shall be afforded all possible protection by us, and be allowed to bring their products into Norfolk and receive goods in exchange, until I can get sufficient force organized to make it safe to throw my lines around them. I have further informed them I shall not require the oath of allegiance from them.
I think we are much indebted to General Wild and his negro troops for what they have done, and it is but fair to record that
while some complaints are made of the action, authorized by Gen'l. Wild against the inhabitants and their property, yet all the committees agree that the negro soldiers made no authorized interference with property or persons, but conducted themselves with propriety.
I find between some of the Officers in this Department in command of white troops a considerable degree of prejudice against the colored troops. In some cases, impediments have been thrown in the way of their recruiting, and interference has been made with them on their expeditions.
This I am investigating, and shall punish with the most stringent measures, trusting and believing that my action will be sustained by the Departments. I shall take leave, therefore, to report for dismissal such as in my judgment, upon investigation, are not fit for the service.
The negro troops, to have a fair chance, ought to have first-class officers, for from their habits of obedience and discipline they are more apt to depend upon their officers than are white soldiers.
I beg leave to enclose a copy of General Wild's report, and also the original proceedings of the citizens of Pasquotank County. I have the honor to be,

A Court Martial is only of use to ascertain the facts in regular form, and after, the revising Officer, the Comd'g General in this case, in reality fixes the punishment.
What can be the necessity of the slow action of a Court Martial when the fact is already ascertained to the satisfaction of the Comd'g Gen. beyond the possibility of a doubt? In any case where there could be the possibility of a dispute as to evidence, I should send the facts to be ascertained by the Court Martial, for I would never punish any man without a hearing, except upon his own confession, unless he in fact confesses by flight.

I learn this accidentally. It may be made out of whole cloth. You will know of course.

It is perfectly well known that you command there, the omission of your name is excusable if the parties are ignorant of the fact, but no one in N.

St. Louis, Jan. 6th, 1864
Dear Sir: Trespassing upon your valuable time with feelings encouraged by your kindness in trying to get a parole for my husband (Brig. Gen. Jeff Thompson), also your liberality towards him, I address these lines to you, hoping they may meet your approbation and especial attention. Do not think me presumptuous. I feel it a duty I owe my children and self to appeal to one in whom I repose the utmost confidence as well as hope of success. I paid a visit to my sister in New Orleans, in November. She told me ""you were a kind, humane gentleman, and relieved the orphans and poor of that city after the surrender, that you were calumnated and slandered very much by persons who did not know you."" I should have remained there, but my sister being a Religious, the Community do not permit seculars to live with them. I saw the General there and obtained a parole of honor, came here.
I wish to request of you a permit to visit Mr. Thompson either at Johnson's Island or Point Lookout, where he is placed under your care. I wish you to obtain it from the Secretary of War if necessary, for me, and send it to me as soon as possible.
I have written to him, but he does not understand my situation at the present time. I have more influence with him when I can speak to him than by writing. His ambition led him into the S. Army. I am sorry he ever entered it. I am peculiarly placed here, his pretended friends are not mine, and being a stranger here, have none of my own.
My little boy is with me, and we must live, pay our board, and have a support. Some of the citizens of St. Joe took the house I lived in from me, and one of my children is with Jeff's sister. I have been round to get sewing here. The river being frozen, there is none to be had, no sale of goods in the stores. I have been called by half a dozen names for fear persons might be arrested for being seen conversing with Mrs. Jeff Thompson. My husband is slandered to my face if I ask for assistance from Southern people. You have no idea how difficult it is for me to get along, so he must resign and take care of his family or we must be sacrificed. For this reason I am desirous to see him and make some arrangements for my family before he goes South again. If you can give or get me a permit, do so; it will be an act of charity to me, not assisting the S. Cause. One more request, with the permit, send me transportation there and back, as I have no means wherewith to travel, no friends to assist. The Southern people are not very friendly with me, I am too ""Union"" and to the Union my husband is a ""rebel."" Please do what you can for me, and show this letter to no one, it is for you alone.
Write to me in answer to this, receive my thanks and a grateful heart. My earnest and fervent prayers for your temporal and spiritual welfare. With sincerity and respect, I remain,
Yours respectfully, Emma C. Thompson"

My dear Madam: I have read your note in relation to sending colored troops into Northumberland County. If I could believe for a moment any of the consequences would follow which you detail, it certainly would not be done. Experience, however, has shown that colored troops, properly officered, are less aggressive than white ones in the places where they are quartered, from the fact that they have been accustomed from their childhood to give up their wills to the wills of those who are over them.
You are entirely mistaken and misinformed as to what was done at Elizabeth City. I have had the Committees from four Counties, Pasquotank, Currituck, Perquimous and Chowan, here, and their universal testimony is that the negro soldiers did nothing but what they were ordered to do.
They committed no acts except under the order of their officers. That we had to burn the houses and carry away the families of the Guerillas is most true, but it was done under orders. I have yet to learn of a single outrage by a colored soldier committed upon any one of the people of Norfolk or Yorktown, and there are three Regiments at one place and four at the other. I can bear the same testimony of the negro Regiments, camped near Fortress Monroe, and if I send, the negroes to the Eastern Shore it will be because of the outrages reported to me of the white troops there stationed. Therefore calm your fears.
I will hold myself responsible that no outrage shall be committed against any peaceable citizens.

"January 11, 1864","From Governor Pierpont
Alexandria, Jan. 11, 1864
Maj. Gen. Butler, Fortress Monroe, Va.
Sir: I was so unwell when I left Norfolk that I could not call on you with any comfort to myself. I regret that I saw much there which gave me great dissatisfaction. I have been laboring since the rebellion broke out in Virginia to re-establish law and order in the State, at such points as were rescued by the Federal arms from Confederate dominion.
The Government I represent is the government of the State of Virginia, as recognized by the President of the United States and both Houses of Congress.
In June last, civil government was established in the cities of Norfolk and Portsmouth, by the election of all the civil officers known to the laws of the state. The corporation, and County Courts were established, and a judge elected for the district court. These courts have jurisdiction of all civil and criminal business.
The secessionists, as a matter of course, resisted in every way they could the establishment of civil courts under loyal jurisdiction, especially as all parties who instituted any civil suit had first to take an oath to support the Constitution of the United States, and the restored government of Virginia. They much preferred going into a Provost Judge's Court, where they had no such oath to take; and in this and all other ways defeat the restored government, if they could.
During the summer and autumn I had succeeded, as I supposed, through your predecessor, in breaking up this interference of Provost Marshal and Provost Judge with civil matters.
But I found, when at Norfolk last, your officers had more fully than ever opened these courts, and were intermeddling with the civil authorities of the cities in a most licentious manner. They had one man immured in the cells of a felon's prison, and a guard over his house, because (and for no other reason) he was not able to pay a large debt to a New York creditor. The Provost Marshal issued an order to the tax-collector, ordering him not to sell some personal property levied on for taxes.
While I was there, he sent to the jail and took out two parties who were charged with a felony or misdemeanor, and awaiting their trial before a civil court of competent jurisdiction, and released them. I have understood since I left that he had notified the Mayor to remove the man who collected the stall fees in the market, asserting that he was going to collect them.
I see by the papers of those cities that the Provost Judge is trying cases called ""ejectment,"" and rendering judgments for possession in five and ten days. The clerk of the court in Norfolk informed me that they were sending to his office for copies and abstracts of deeds, with a view to selling real estate for debts.
Aside from public policy, I need not remind you that this Provost Marshal and Judge can make no sale of personal or real estate for debts that will pass any title. That due process of law spoken of in the Constitution of the United States, by which alone a man is to be deprived of his property, never meant, and never will mean, the process directed from a Provost Judge's court executed by a Provost Marshal.
But this proceeding has nothing in it to suppress the rebellion, or render the army more efficient, but, upon the contrary, its very tendency is to keep up the rebellion, to exasperate Union men as well as rebels, and mix everything in inextricable confusion. The proper course, to be pursued by the commandant of a department situated as Norfolk and Portsmouth are, is so plain that there need be no clash or misconception.
The civil authorities will attend to administering the civil and criminal law as heretofore; the military attend to everything that has for its object the rendering of the army efficient
and well-disciplined; in the correction of soldiers for misconduct, in cases of conflict between soldier and citizen, I have no objection to the military taking cognizance.
All police regulations to prevent smuggling and giving liquor to soldiers may be proper subjects for the military police. But as to collection of debts, the trial of citizens for offences against citizens, and the rights of real estate, and interference in the collection of State and city taxes, and the collection of stall fees in the market, the military cannot, and ought not to have anything to do.
I have written you fully and plainly my views on this subject, hoping that you will take the same view of the subject I do. I shall demand that the interference of the Provost Marshal in the cases above alluded to be investigated, and if found a mere wanton exercise of power, I shall demand his punishment.
Desiring to cultivate the best understanding with you, and hoping that we may work together in harmony in the great cause of suppressing the rebellion, and restoring peace and order to our beloved country. I am,
Yours etc., F. H. Pierpont, Governor"

His Excellency F. H. Pierpont, Governor of Virginia
Sir: I have received your letter in relation to the subject of the interference of the military with the civil Government of Norfolk. Premising that no one can be more anxious than myself that the Civil Government of Virginia should have every power, and exercise every right, and that every man shall be protected under the law, I will content myself at present with saying that many of the facts suggested in your note are new to me, and some of them the first time brought to my notice, and that I will cause immediate investigation to be made, and will apply the proper remedy if in my judgment any wrong has been done. Of one thing I am certain, you must have been misinformed. No man appears before my Provost Court who has not taken the oath of allegiance, in any capacity except as a criminal, and my instructions are that no debts shall be collected save against those who are in rebellion against the United States, in favor of loyal citizens,
and where the property might escape from the honest creditor by reason of confiscation. I propose in a few days to call the attention of the Legislature to the City Government of Norfolk and Portsmouth, and shall ask your aid, if it becomes necessary, to see to it that there is some Civil Government in those cities.
The difficulty I find is, that there are all the civil officers known to the law and none of the Government. I have issued an order, a copy of which I enclose, to get the data upon which to found such representations, and as soon after the 20th as may be, I shall bring the matter to your attention. I desire to work with you in every harmony to restore Civil Government. In regard to the stalls in the market, I have only directed an interference to prevent a collection by the City Government of a year's rent in advance, which would virtually close the market and stop the supplies to my troops. And I know you will at once recognize the necessity and propriety of my action in that regard. Inviting most cordially through you any information which you may have in regard to the working of any measure or the acts of any officer which may be supposed to be detrimental to the interests of the Government, I remain,

The Commanding Officer will immediately take measures to recruit his Regiment to the fullest extent. He will give receipts to all loyal men who have taken the Oath prescribed by the President's Proclamation, for any slave which may be recruited. He will report to me immediately any deficiency in his Officers, incompetency, or any vacancy that may exist, that the one may be taken notice of and the other filled.
He will call upon the Quarter Master for the necessary transportation and report to these Head Quarters the execution of this Order. I have the honor to be,

Dear Sir: I saw in the Portsmouth Old Dominion of this morning the extract of a speech made by Mr. Brownly, of Portsmouth, in the House of Delegates of restored Government of Virginia, in which I think he misrepresented yourself and the Military Government in this department, and hope you will not think he spoke the sentiments of the Union people of this district, and particularly of this city.
Having been born and raised here, I believe I know the opinions of the people as well as any one in the district. My brother represents the City of Norfolk in the Senate, and know he does not entertain any such views as advanced by Mr. Brownly. Your course generally has met the most hearty approval of the Union party, particularly in relation to the colored population, the only course in my opinion that can put down the rebellion.

J. L. Dozier, E. H. Beazeley, and others, the representatives of a sect calling themselves ""Christians,"" in Norfolk and Portsmouth, who petition to be excused from taking the oath of allegiance and doing military duty
Gentlemen: I have read your petition to General Barnes, setting forth your objections to swearing allegiance to any earthly government, in which you therein establish, to your own satisfaction, three points.
First. That government, although an evil, is a necessary one.
Second. That for a time it is permitted to exist by the wisdom of Jehovah.
Third. That the time of its existence at which a period is to be put to its existence is not yet come.
Therefore (you) ought to swear allegiance to the Government of the United States.
First. Because, although an evil, you admit it to be necessary.
Second. Although an evil, you admit that it is permitted by the wisdom of Jehovah, and it is not for His creatures to question the wisdom of His acts.
Third. You only claim to be excused when Jehovah's government is substituted, which period has not yet arrived.

Dear General: I have yours of 9th, and thank you for your attention to Mr. Coolidge's 6 letters, which was most gratifying to his family.
My present idea about Middlesex stock is to divide 50% in stock, making the capital $750,000. It will then be in the same relative basis of capital and production as the Washington & Salisbury, and I do not want to make the stock larger or we shall be at a disadvantage as compared with them.
I am meditating some cotton operations in Tennessee, for which I require the confidence of Genl. Hurlburt in my integrity and good faith, rather than any credit, as the operations are of a confidential character. I can find no one here who knows him, and it has occurred to me that as a brother officer of the same rank, a letter from you saying simply that I am a man of good position and character and whose word may be trusted would not be inappropriate. Should you see no objection, and can find time to send me such a letter, you will do me a favor. I shall soon have to make a new arrangement with Wendell
1 and Perry,
2 and must pay them more. We are making too much money to be able to afford to change our organization at present, and the great profits which are being made by men of their skill and capacity make it only just to increase their compensation.

Fortress Monroe, Va., Jan. 14, 1864
General: During a visit to Beaufort, N. C., last summer it was suggested to me that there was great need felt of a saw mill, to supply the market, both there and at the North, with hard pine lumber -- and having had considerable experience in business, my friends advised me to engage in it. Accordingly, I applied to Col. Heaton, Special Treas. Agent for that district, for a permit to erect such a sawmill.
This permit was granted me Nov. 30, allowing me to erect the mill, but restricting me to sawing lumber for domestic purposes; stipulating expressly that I must not ship any lumber technically known as ship timber.
Being prevented by circumstances not within my control from laying the subject before you, I have proceeded to act on Col. Heaton's permit, and now have in process of erection a mill capable of sawing not only lumber for domestic purposes, but well arranged to turn out ship timber of any size.
This mill is situated on a point of land about three miles from Morehead City, known as Crab Point.
I am especially desirous, General, of obtaining from you permission to ship all kinds of lumber to market. I should wish, of course, to serve Government first, whenever the products of the mill were needed for its purposes. But I fail to see the reason why ship timber should be excluded from my permit.
I would also most respectfully request you to allow officers in that Department to afford me such facilities as are needed in towing vessels in and out of the harbor and in minor matters of transportation for myself in prosecuting this enterprise. They are such as I cannot obtain without such officers' cooperation.
I also desire to be instructed by you as to the amount of taxation for which I am liable. In purchasing this mill, the owner added a five per cent government tax in his estimate, which I paid. On the arrival of the mill at Morehead, the Collector demanded six per cent, for which I have given bonds, pending the decision of the question. Shall I pay this additional tax?
Awaiting your order on the above subjects, I remain, General,

Sir: I have the honor to return the papers transmitted to me in relation to the case of Mrs. A. E. Fuller, whose house was taken for military use in New Orleans. The history of the transaction is this. Mrs. Fuller, a loyal lady of the North, owns a house in New Orleans, upon which some persons there made claim. At the request of Mr. Jacob Barker, her Agent, I interfered to get him possession of that property, and made special exertions, because Mrs. Fuller was well known to me, and her brother and family were among my intimate friends, to protect it. It was taken possession of and occupied by an Officer from the 7th of November, (1862) to the 16th of December, (1862), when I turned over the command of the Dept. to General Banks, and up to that time the house was better for the occupancy, and not a scar was upon it, or a
single injury inflicted. What has happened since I only learn from the papers submitted to me. It was not used during the time for a Cavalry Hospital, for I had no cavalry in that neighborhood. I see from the papers submitted to me that it was returned on the 27th of June 1863, very much injured.
It will be seen that under my administration it was occupied forty (40) days, under the administration of General Banks was occupied one hundred and ninety three (193) days, therefore the Honorable Sec'y. of War will judge of my surprise, if I could be surprised at anything that might happen in the Department of the Gulf since I left it, to read the endorsement of Gen'l. Banks that the occupation of the house occurred during ""my"" administration, and was one of the many cases of which he had no knowledge, and could not approve, for the reason that the use of the property was not authorized by ""him,"" and that no record of such authority is to be found in the Department, when the very paper on which the endorsement is made by Gen'l. Banks shows the fact forty (40) days of the occupation was under my administration, and one hundred and ninety three (193) days under his. That no record of it has been made, is doubtless true, and as little singular. But the want of method and system in his own administration should not be charged to my account. Therefore, these papers are respectfully returned to the Secretary of War, with the assurance that I will see that Mrs. Fuller is paid for the forty (40) days occupation by the military, by my order, without injury to the property, whether or not Gen'l. Banks will see my neighbor and friend Mrs. Fuller paid for the one hundred and ninety three (193) days' occupation of her property, under his administration, wherein it was returned to her greatly damaged. Any further information which is desired of me in the case will be most cheerfully given. I have the honor to be,

Gentlemen: I have received your letter proposing the following questions to me, and asking an answer.
First. ""Your general policy towards this section, if the people remain quiet and peaceful?""
Answer. To let you alone, except to furnish you every facility to get family supplies, and to market your provisions within our lines.
 -- 306  -- Second. ""Whether raids will be permitted or not in the future, and if permitted, how to be conducted?""
Answer. There will be no raids permitted within your County, unless some act of hostility to the United States is committed by some person therein. And when ordered, private property of peaceable citizens will not be destroyed except from military necessity and in punishment for the crimes of the owners.
Third. ""What will be required of those Rangers who lay down their arms and remain at home?""
Answer. Nothing except to take the Oath of Allegiance and Parole to the U. S., and remain quiet thereafter. The certificate of that oath will protect them provided it is kept in good faith.
Fourth. ""What will be required of those parties heretofore engaged in contraband trade, who wish to remain at home?""
Answer. They can remain at home after having taken the Oath of Allegiance.
I have put the requirement of the Oath of Allegiance to the parties heretofore in arms, and engaged in contraband trade, and thus aiding the rebellion, because those are the terms of the President's Proclamation. Amnesty is granted them on the condition of their taking the oath. I do not require the oath of those who have been peaceable citizens, until I can throw around them my lines and afford them protection. Amnesty to those actively engaged in the rebellion is pardoned for the crime to which the Oath of Allegiance is the title.
In regard to the case of Major Rogley, he may be permitted to remain at his home so long as he remains quiet, upon taking the Parole annexed to General Order No. 49, a copy of which I enclose. From his peculiar relations and situation the oath is not required. I have the honor to be,

Lowell, Jany. 17th, 1864
My dear General: Nothing of interest had transpired since my return, and politics at present are at a dead calm. The opinion generally prevails that Mr. Lincoln will be renominated, and the quiet public seems to have accepted it as a fixed fact. The movements in Pennsylvania and New Hampshire indicate some concert and activity on the part of his friends, and efforts will probably be made in other States. The condition of things is a disappointment to the Powers in Mass. In a conversation with the Collector at Boston a short time since, it was plainly perceptible that the sentiment in Lincoln's favor was annoying him.
Mr. Bullock says he will make a stand this fall, but this I think will depend much upon his friends. He is constitutionally timid, thinks his chance uncertain, and fears to hazard anything. I think his chance a good one if the present incumbent could be disposed of the present year, but the delay of another twelve months may be fatal.
I reported the doings of the National League at our Council, and gave a short relation of what I saw at the Fort and at Norfolk, not omitting the story of Pat. O'Fallon, and was pleased to find that every allusion to you ""brought down the house.""

it as highly interesting, and on its being said that Mr. Parton made entertaining books they quietly rejoined that they were more than pleased with your orders and proclamations, they were so graphic and so easily to be comprehended. I think it no mean praise that ladies and learned professors agree in judgment upon such papers.
I have seen all of your folks since my return save Mr. Reed. His wife told me he had derived much benefit from his journey to the Fortress. There are two members of the old sixth Regiment desirous of serving under you. The first, Charles E. Poor, was a sergeant in Co. H. for the three months' service, first lieutenant in the nine months', now wishes a captain in one of the colored regiments. My partner, Jewett, represents him as an officer, one who is always on duty and in his place. He commanded Co. C. (the phalanx) in a fight in your present department, and is reported to have behaved gallantly. In my judgment he is worthy of the position, and will make a fine officer. The other is Reuben P. Charters, was a private in Co. H., served his time, and enlisted in Light Battery A, Capt. Porter, for 3 years, where he has filled the office of corporal and sergeant, and has again enlisted in the same Corps for 3 years. He says he would like a second lieutenant's position in the colored cavalry, seems he knows all that can be known in the light battery service, and could readily adapt himself to the cavalry. Mr. Jewett thinks him a good soldier, and he appears earnest, and would doubtless acquit himself well. I hope you may be able to find them both places. If you can appoint but one, Poor is the ablest man, one of whom it is said ""He is never sick.""
Mrs. Heard, I hear, will soon be with you. Please present my kind regards to Mrs. Butler.
Truly your friend, Tappan Wentworth"

Mr. Mayor, Dear Sir: I am in receipt of your communication in regard to the returns to be made by your City Officers. I had a conversation with the Mayor of Norfolk, and supposed, but it seems wrongfully, that the two cities lying side by side, under the same State laws, had the same officers. But it seems they are different.
If you will do me the favor to have the Order which has been sent you given to the proper Officers, so that I may get full information of the condition of your City Government, I shall have attained all I desire, my object being simply to get the proper information so that I can shape my action accordingly. At present you see how much in the dark I am in regard to the state of affairs, and therefore unable to co-operate with you, or to aid you in any way.
My principal object is to get the exact state of the revenues of the city. Hundreds of your people are calling for aid to relieve them from cold and hunger. Until I can ascertain what the city is doing for them, through what organization aid can be given them, without subjecting me to imposition and wrong, I can organize no system for their relief.
I desire also to aid you if necessary in collecting taxes for this and other proper objects, believing that your whole tax system is now in such disorder as to be incapable of being enforced. I pray you do not allow your people to be influenced by any rumor. I by no means seek to suspend the operations of Civil Government, but on the contrary to aid it in its efficiency, if I find, as no doubt I shall, that the Civil Government wishes to co-operate with me. I have some money which belongs to the City of Portsmouth, in justice to be expended there. I desire to have it expended intelligently and economically. And the same in regard to the City of Norfolk, and if you will ask the Mayor of that City you will find that my whole conversation with him, which took place in the presence of Mr. Tazwell Taylor, was in relation to city expenditures, and the objects for which the expenditures were made, and, by curtailing those expenditures, to find funds to meet other pressing wants.
Assure your people that I have no present intention of making any suspension of Civil Government, and shall not do so if I find, as I have no doubt I shall, that that Government is willing and ready to aid me in the common object, which is the sáfety and welfare of the city. I will give the extension of time you desire. I have the honor to be,

Sir: I received this morning the enclosed communication from Col. Spear, commanding the exterior line near Norfolk. I reported some time since to the War Department the action of Brig. Gen'l. Wild, to which this is in relation. Were this the act of General Pickett simply, I should readily know what course to pursue, but it is evidently the act of the Confederate Government. Private Jones, Co. ""B,"" 5th Ohio Volunteers, was evidently taken from among the prisoners of war at Richmond and turned over to General Pickett for this purpose. Therefore it seems to me to be a subject for the action of the Government, not for the action of a commander of a Department.
The strongest evidence that this is the action of the Confederate Government which I have is the fact that we have no Ohio troops in the Department upon whom vengeance could, have been wreaked in this way.
This action may be as well met now as any time. Our Government has suffered its officers and men to be outlawed for doing their duty. It has suffered its prisoners to be starved without retaliation, and now hanging is superadded. I state the fact, I do not presume to offer advice. I have also the honor to enclose a letter from Col. Hinton to me, upon this subject. I have the honor to be,

From the general tenor of the letter, and from the fact that it is endorsed to an officer of my command, I am induced to believe that Gen. Wild intended his threat against ""Guerillas"" not to be applied to the officers and men of my command. The 66th Regiment, of North Carolina State Troops, which I have the honor to command, was organized under authority obtained from the Governor of the State, and its officers are regularly commissioned by the Governor. With this explanation, I desire to know whether it is your purpose to pursue the policy indicated in Gen. Wild's letter to Capt. Ellcott,
1 in the event if it should hereafter capture any of the officers or men of my command, or are they to be recognized and treated as other prisoners of war. I have captured a goodly number of the officers and men
of the U. S. Army and Navy, and have uniformly treated them as prisoners of war. I desire to treat those I may capture hereafter similarly, but as a matter of course I shall be guided in the future in my treatment to your men by the answer I receive to this letter. I desire further to call your attention to the fact that the ladies whose names are mentioned in Gen. Wild's letter, are, as I am informed, still held in close confinement in the city of Norfolk.

Head Quars. Dept. Va. and N. C., Fort Monroe, Jan. 26th, 1864
Lt. Wm. J. Manden, and Mr. Pendes Wicks
Messrs.: In answer to your application in regard to your wives, held as hostages by Gen. Wild for the treatment of his colored soldier Samuel Jones of the 5th U. S. Colored. Upon a full examination I have determined:
First. That as no difference was made between Jordan and Daniel Bright on account of color, one being hanged in retaliation for the other by the Rebel authorities, the case presupposed by Gen. Wild when the hostages were taken in the persons of three women, that some different treatment would be meted out to his soldier, because his color not having arisen, the order given by him for execution of the women in retaliation will be revoked.
Second. I will return the women to North West Landing, with a copy of this note as direction to the Officer there; that upon your placing yourselves in his hands in their stead, to be treated as prisoners of War, unless some outrage not justified by civilized warfare is perpetrated by the men of your commands, the two women Mrs. Wm. J. Manden and Mrs. Pendes Wicks will be delivered to their friends.
I take leave to assure you that nothing has been done to them to annoy, insult, or injure them, except the detention, as I have no doubt they will inform you when you see them.
I am compelled to require your presence and detention instead of your wives on account of further threatened retaliation
made by the men of your Regiment upon the soldiers who may be unfortunate enough to fall into their hands, and in order that the transaction may assure you and your people:
First. That we will not permit outrages upon our men without swift, severe, and stern retaliation. It is for your friends therefore to make the choice. Daniel Bright, who was executed by Gen. Wild, was a deserter from the 62nd. Georgia, was wrongfully enlisted in the 66th North Carolina, was engaged not in warfare, but in pillage and murder as a Guerilla, was duly tried by Court Martial, sentenced, and hanged, and the execution of Private Jordan, in retaliation for that act, will be made the subject of other and different measures from any that relate to yourselves and your treatment. I have the honor to be,
Very respectfully yours,

Col. James W. Hinton, Com'dg N. C. State Forces
Colonel: Your letter per Flag of Truce of date of Jan. 15th was received, enclosing a copy of a letter of Brig. Gen. Wild's to John Y. Ellcott, Capt. of Guerillas. I am glad of an opportunity to state to you the exact policy which I propose to pursue in carrying on the war now raging between the Confederate Authorities and my Government, because upon that subject there seems to be a wide misunderstanding. Perhaps the easiest way to elucidate it, will be an explicit statement of what I do not mean to do.
First -- then -- I do not mean to conduct the war like a fish woman in Billingsgate, by calling hard names, such as ""Brute, Beast"" etc.
Second. I do not mean to carry it on by any futile proclamations of outlawry against any soldier duly authorized and commissioned for doing his duty.
Third. I do not mean to carry it on by threatening, when I am beaten, to take to the woods and organize Guerilla forces.
Fourth. I do not propose to carry it on unless my troops will obey my orders. And if they do not, while I am in command of them, I shall not afford them protection.
Again. I do mean to carry on this war according to the rules of civilized warfare as between alien enemies.
To apply, then, the principle to the case you mention of the action of Gen. Wild. Gen. Wild found Daniel Bright, a deserter from the 62nd Georgia Reg't., carrying on robbery and pillage in the peaceable counties of Camden and Pasquotank. He was further informed, and believed, that being such a deserter he and his company had refused to obey any order emanating from you, or the Governor of North Carolina, because you had frequently ordered the squad, of which he pretended to be one, across the Chowan River, and they had refused to obey.
These facts appeared to the Court Martial before which Daniel Bright was tried, and in my judgment brought him within the strict meaning of the term ""Guerilla."" If these facts are true, and they are known to you if they are so, the fact that he was a member of a Georgia Regiment, being shown by the placard put upon the body of Private Jordan, who was hanged in retaliation for him, it is quite clear that he met his fate according to every rule of warfare; and the murder of Jordan in pretended retaliation for him will be met in such a way as becomes the Government which I represent.
If Ellcott and his men had refused to obey your orders and to march as they were directed, but remained in a peaceable county, against the will of the inhabitants, plundering and burning, as they were doing, and as we were informed they were doing, they also deserved a like fate as Daniel Bright, by every rule of civilized warfare. But if your men are met in the field, in the usual duties of soldiers, under your command, or that of any other duly qualified officer, carrying on war in any form that war has been carried on by any Christian nation, except the English against the Chinese, they will be treated whenever captured as prisoners of war, and all the more tenderly by me because they are North Carolina troops, most of whom I believe are unwillingly in the service of the Confederate Government. Gen. Wild's threat was only against ""Guerillas,"" and those are the men coming within the description which I have given, and you can easily determine for yourself whether your Regiment as organized does come within that description. If not, they fear nothing worse than imprisonment. If they do, it will be more convenient for them not to get into our hands.
I leave it to your own good sense whether the kind of warfare carried on for the past year in the Counties of Camden, Carrituck, Pasquotank, and the neighboring Counties, tends
either to set up the Confederate Government among the nations of the earth or overthrow the Government of the United States: and if it does neither, whether such a warfare ought not to be stopped by the most stringent measures. I have the honor to be,

Sir: As you were absent from Head Quarters on my return from North Carolina, I beg to report that I ascertained from Mr. D. Heaton, Superintendent and Special Agent of the Treasury Department, at Newbern, that no permit to cut timber can be granted save under order from the Secretary of the Navy, endorsed by Rear Admiral Lee, -- such an order I am now endeavoring to obtain.
The cord-wood cutting, which you requested me to examine into, has been thoroughly canvassed. Capt. Cook, Asst. Quarter Master at Newbern, has given to me every facility for its accomplishment, -- he showed me that the locality in the rear of Newbern, and on the line of the Railroad, has become exhausted, being too expensive from the distance of transportation. Capt. Cook recommends operating on the north side of the river, nearly opposite the city, -- of course a guard will be necessary to hold guerillas in check. Capt. Cook will speak of the matter, when he sees you, as he expects shortly to do
at Newbern. When the locality is determined upon, I think that I can arrange to have a large quantity cut for the Government, at a fair price.

Newbern, N. C., January 23, 1864
Sir: Yours of the 17th inst. has been received.
You ask me ""by what regulation no timber can be got in North Carolina except by order of the Secretary of the Navy, endorsed by Admiral Lee?""
This question, as put to me, assumes, as I understand it, that no timber can be got in this state except by an order as above indicated, and that I have sanctioned the same.
I desire to say to you that whoever has represented or stated to you that no timber can be procured in this state only on such a requisition, has uttered to you that which is false.
I know of no regulation preventing timber from being procured here, but I have taken the view for some months that it was manifestly against the public interest to allow good yellow pine, adapted exclusively for ship building purposes, to be cut, indiscriminately, by private parties.
Having received information that this particular description of timber was quite limited within our present military lines, I have deemed it proper to decline complying with the request of various private parties from different sections of the country to cut, saw, & export it.
While I have done this with the conviction that the War & the Navy Department ought to determine under the circumstances when it is proper to allow this description of timber to
be taken, I have given several permits allowing large privileges in the way of procuring timber for house building & house furnishing purposes; also for several other highly-useful objects, such as the manufacture of staves, shingles, veneering, &c.
There is an abundance of timber for such purposes, & a most liberal latitude is given to loyal & responsible persons to obtain the same. Wood can also be readily procured in large quantities.
The only authorities given up to this time to procure ship timber have been to M. S. Bradley, Esq. & John H. Baker, Esq.; the authority given to the first party was founded upon recommendation of a substantial character. Mr. Baker, to whom the other authority was issued, made application to me for it as early as the month of June last, & having reason to regard him as a gentleman of high standing for loyalty & responsibility, I complied with his request.
Both of these authorities, however, gave the parties the right to procure ship timber by purchase from loyal persons only, & containing distinct stipulations that what they did procure should be tendered to the proper navy agents at New York. Mr. Bradley, at great expense and trouble, has shipped one cargo to New York, but Mr. Baker has not shipped one foot.
I have given no person any authority to take ship timber from abandoned or public lands, and from the fact of the scarcity of the article & the danger & difficulty in getting it out within our present military lines, I have deemed it a duty to suspend the issuing of authorities of this character.
I do not hesitate to say to you that I regard this as the correct policy until our lines are extended & more security afforded. When this is done, as I trust it will be done speedily, then the kind of timber in question can be thrown open to all loyal parties.
I do not dispute for one moment your military right or that of General Peck to take & appropriate for military purposes just what you may deem necessary of the kind of timber referred to, but under existing circumstances I believe the true course has been taken.
Very respectfully, Your obt. servt.,
D. Heaton, Supt. Spc. Agt. Trea. Dept."

Alexandria, Va., January 20th, 1864
Hon. Sec. War, Washington, D. C.
Sir: In addition to the two orders of Gen. Butler which I submitted to the President on Saturday last, in regard to the banks and civil officers of the City of Norfolk and Portsmouth, I desire to call your attention to further orders and regulations of his in that Department, which I think tend to the oppression of the people and subversive of good government, and in no way to the suppression of the rebellion.
Gen. Butler has issued an order requiring all merchants taking goods into his department to pay one per cent on the cost. All persons going to and coming from Old Point and Norfolk pay one dollar for pass (except State Officers and Military Officers and soldiers), and three dollars on all vessels clearing at Old Point. This money goes to the fund to support the Provost Marshal's Office.
This collection of money I conceive to be wrong and oppressive on the people, without reference to the fact that it is not paid into the treasury of the U. S.. They pay now five per cent on all the goods that are taken there, into the U. S. Treasury, and five per cent on all the produce sent away. Also, all the licenses to the U. S. assessed under the internal revenue laws. Now, to burden them with one per cent more, one dollar for pass each way, three dollars for clearing all vessels, is more than ought to be done. But in addition to all this, there is the Provost Marshal with his Provost Judges Court, who are taking cognizance of all civil and criminal causes from ejectment, to getting drunk in the city. I was informed that they had rendered judgments and execution for large amounts of money, were seizing and selling property; they had seized one man and confined him for some time in the felon's cell in jail because he did or could not pay a large debt to some N. York creditor. The clerk of the County Court informed me that they had been sending to his office for deeds and abstracts of real estate with a view to selling. I saw notices in the city newspapers there of cases of ejectment, judgment, and possession ordered in five or ten days. I wrote to Gen. Butler calling his attention to this mischievous abuse of power, stating that this Provost Marshal and Provost Judges Court could not sell property, real or personal, for debt on a judgment and execution rendered by them, that would pass any title to the property sold. That it was only mixing matters in greater confusion, and asked him to abolish the Court.
He replied by saying, ""My instructions are that no debts shall be collected save against those who are in rebellion against the United States in favor of loyal citizens, and where the property might escape from the honest creditor by reason of confiscation.""
This is an excuse that I had not expected from a lawyer of Gen. Butler's standing. There is a County and Corporation Court, a Circuit Court, and the U. S. District Court, all in the City of Norfolk, all of which are accessible to all persons who
will take the proper oath. By the laws of Virginia any person in rebellion is declared a non-resident of the state, and an attachment will issue on a proper application in one minute after or at any time between the institution of the suit and judgment, and the attachment is a lien from the time it goes into the Sheriff's hands as to real estate, and from the time of levy on personal estate, -- so there can be no possible excuse for this Provost Court, except it be to charge five or ten per cent for the collection to go into the hands of the Provost Marshal's fund. But this Provost Marshal takes cognizance of all the petty offences in the city which properly belong to the Mayor and Civil Magistrates, and levies fines from one to five dollars. In addition to this, he has the handsome income from fines for selling and smuggling liquors, which range from $50 to $800 each, just as the parties are able to pay. This all goes to support the Provost Marshal's Office.
While I was in the city of Norfolk, about the 28th of Dec., there were two men confined in jail for felony or misdemeanor. under warrant of a justice. The Provost Marshal sent and took them out, and sent them before the Provost Judge. No witnesses were sent; the Provost Judge released the men, and set them at liberty. The Provost Marshal issued an order prohibiting the sale of property belonging to a secessionist, executed by the collectors of revenue for taxes. He threatened to arrest and imprison the Mayor, and declared his intention to break up civil government in his command. These acts were followed by orders from Gen. Butler to the civil officers to report to him the amount of their salaries, etc. After Gen. Butler's subordinates have done everything to intimidate, worry, and disgust the civil officers, to discourage them from discharge of their duty, he then declares them of no account.
Another act of Gen. Butler's I will mention, which is a gross assumption of power in my estimation. He has issued orders for enrolling and conscripting all the white men in his district able to bear arms. I have no objection to the President of the United States, through his Provost Marshal General conscripting the people of Virginia, when in his opinion it ought to be done under the act of Congress. But I have a most decided objection to Gen. Butler on his own account, and without authority of law, assuming such prerogative, and executing such delicate trust. The people in Gen. Butler's district in Virginia have paid all the internal revenue to the U. S. which has been assessed, as much so as the City of Boston,
and in addition have paid five per cent into the Treasury of U. S. on all goods brought in and the same on all produce sent out. They have furnished more troops according to population than any people in the U. S. But they have been mostly black. They claim to be put on the same footing with Maryland and Kentucky as to conscription.
What I claim and respectfully ask, without going into detail for the reason therefor, is this --
1st. That Gen. Butler is not allowed to interfere with the banks of the State.
2nd. That his order requiring civil officers to report amount of salaries etc. to him, be revoked.
3rd. That the one per cent on merchandise, one dollar on passes, three dollars on clearing of vessels, be abolished, and that nothing be allowed for that service.
4th. That the Provost Marshal's Court in the state of Virginia, for the collection of debts and the trial of all civil causes by the same in regard to real and personal estate, be abolished and prohibited.
The reason of this is so apparent that I do not feel like making further argument in the premises. It is Gen. Butler's duty to attend to the army and its discipline. There is no sort of use for a Military Government in Norfolk or Portsmouth. A sensible, honest Provost Marshal is all that is needed. Two companies to guard the commissary stores is all the army that is wanting. But as to giving place to more Brigadiers and officers, military, I am not going to raise questions or find fault on the subject, but the path of duty is so plain that if the military will only attend to their own business, and let the civil officers attend to theirs, there can be no difficulty -- and all will work in harmony.
I have never attempted to invade a single right of a military officer, but [have] been willing for the sake of peace to yield much. Yet I don't intend to give up all the civil rights of the people without a struggle. I am,
Yours etc., F. H. Pierpont

Hon. P. H. Watson, Asst. Secretary of War
Sir: The steamer ""City of New York,"" running as Flag of Truce boat in the Bay and up the James River, has been employed by the Government from the 2nd of July, 1862, to the 22nd of April, 1863, at six hundred dollars per day, and earning $176,400 during that time. From April 22nd, 1863, to Dec. 1st, 1863, at four hundred dollars a day, earning $85,600, making $262,000 earned up to December 1st, 1863. For some unknown and unexplained reason, her charter was not renewed until December 1st, 1863, with the accruing clause to the Government. If it had been, she would have made for the Government in the time between forty and fifty thousand dollars. She was then put in at a valuation of $150,000. Before
the War, I am informed that she could have been bought for $46,000.
Why she should have been put in at the enormous price of $150,000 is a mystery. She has now earned for the Government only $6,575, which is not a flea bite upon her valuation. I directed that she would either take $250. a day or be discharged. The owners say she shall not work for the Government at that price. I did this without knowing her previous history. I still think she ought to be discharged, unless, what is manifestly just and right to be done, she is seized by the Government and her owners allowed to get what they can upon the seizure. They are clearly not entitled to more than thirty or forty thousand dollars, possibly fifty, on the boat. Had I the power, I would settle the matter without much trouble, but as it is referred to you, please advise me at once what to do with her. I inclined very strongly to the seizure. She has paid for herself under the government almost twice. If the Government can do nothing, and the owners choose to take her away, I propose to order two other boats of them that are in charter by the Government to be discharged also. I think these men have made enough out of the Government, not to throw themselves in our faces this way. You will observe that this charter was renewed at New York. Would it not be well to inquire why the officer in New York left out of the charter the accruing clause. If a Quartermaster in this Department is interested in the sale of an old horse, by which the Government may not lose more than ten dollars, you discharge him summarily, and rightly; but if a Quartermaster at New York refuses to do what is ordered to be done for the Government, by which the Government loses some fifty thousand dollars, we hear nothing from it.

Dear Sir: I have information from a source that I deem reliable that Mrs. J. Tyler (widow of Ex. President Tyler) was let through our lines last summer at the time several hundred women and children were sent over by Flag of Truce from Baltimore and Fortress Monroe. She then took with her six or seven large travelling ""two-story"" trunks from this Island.
Although told by her brother-in-law, D. L. Gardener, she could not get them through, she said there would be no difficulty, as she was well acquainted with General Dix.
Her Secession Ladyship, having reached Dixie -- and no doubt disposed of her wares to good advantage, runs the blockade to Nassau and thence back to Staten Island, where she is now staying with her mother at the house of D. L. Gardener, her brother-in-law. Gardener is one of our secession sympathizing Supervisors, who with his sympathizing associates raised $75,000 on the credit of the people, and applied it to keep men from going to the war.
I apprise you of the course Mrs. T. has pursued, so you may be on the lookout should she again attempt to slide through by using or abusing the friendship of officials. I will keep a sharp lookout for her movements, and advise you if she again starts for Dixie.
Have written to Gen. Dix to know if he recollects of passing her over. If he answers you, I shall post him how she returned. If he did not allow her to go, some one else has, and I am

Norfolk, Virginia, January 23rd, 1864
Statement concerning Mrs. --, George W. Lane, and Major Morse, special Treasury Agent, District of Virginia
About June 1863, Mrs. -- came to Suffolk, Virginia, and was brought before Major Smith of the 112th New York S. V., who was the Provost Marshal of that place.
Mrs. -- represented that she was from the vicinity of Chowan River, North Carolina, that she came through the lines to make arrangements to dispose of 1200 bales of cotton that belonged to parties near Chowan River, North Carolina, who are loyal at heart to the United States Government, said cotton would be sold for ten dollars per 100 pounds, provided goods could be returned for one-half the cotton bought, and the remaining half in Federal notes.
Major Smith gave Mrs. -- permission to go to Norfolk, Virginia, as Suffolk, Virginia, was about being evacuated. About July, 1863, Brigadier General Naglee took command of the District of Virginia and about the same time Captain -- became acquainted with Mrs. -- and finding her without funds, he placed her at the National Hotel, and paid what bills she incurred until October 1863, when Brigadier Gen. Naglee went to Washington, D. C., and Captain -- accompanied him. About that time, Mrs. -- took quarters at Mrs. Brown's house at Bute street, Norfolk, Virginia, where she became acquainted with Major --, Paymaster District of Virginia, who took charge of Mrs. -- and he is still keeping her up to this date.
Captain George H. Johnston, being aware of the circumstances connected with Mrs. --, communicated the facts to Major Morse, Special Treasury Agent upon his arrival at this place. He called on Mrs. --, and after learning of the location of the cotton near Chowan River, North Carolina, Major Morse went to Baltimore, Maryland, and in company with George W. Lane, proceeded to Washington, D. C., with a letter to Secretary Chase, from Mr. Hoffman, collector of the port of Baltimore, Md., recommending that they be allowed to buy and bring inside the lines, said cotton near Chowan River, N. C.
Secretary Chase referred Major Morse and George W. Lane to Mr. David Heaton, Special Treasury Agent at Beaufort, N. C.
Major Morse and George W. Lane arrived at Norfolk, Virginia, on Jan. 15th 1864, sent for Mrs. --, and proposed to her that she should go through the lines and make arrangements to have the cotton for a certain price brought to a certain point, to the amt. of five hundred thousand ($500,000) dollars, promising to remunerate her for the trouble and comply with the terms of giving one-half in goods at the point the cotton was taken from, and the remaining half in Federal notes.
They promised to see her again January 16th, 1864. Major Morse and George W. Lane went to Beaufort, N. C., equipped with a letter from Mr. Hoffman to David Heaton, and a bond signed and witnessed for one hundred thousand dollars ($100,000), to insure the government of the 5 per cent duty, thereby endeavoring to make it a legal business.
January 20th, 1864, Major Morse and George W. Lane returned to Norfolk, Virginia, and said they were entirely successful in their arrangements about the cotton while at Beaufort, North Carolina.
George W. Lane has gone to Baltimore, Md. He will return in a few days to this department, and in order that he may be here on official business, he is making arrangements to raise the iron steamer ""Forbes,"" that is sunk near Cape Henry, Virginia. But his real business is to get some twelve hundred (1200) bales of cotton near Chowan River, North Carolina.
Mrs. -- is on Nebraska street, near Union street, Norfolk, Va., and is very anxious to go to her home in North Carolina, and it is probable she will soon make a move in that direction.

Please, Uncle, enquire for him, and see if he has been taken prisoner, and do what you can for him, for I hear how badly they treat prisoners in Tennessee. Please write at once and tell me if you can learn anything of him. He is your own nephew, and you ought to take an interest in him, and I know you do, not minding the difficulties you have had. He is very kind to me. Now, Uncle, you know that I am getting on very well, but I could not have things as I do if Joe had not given me his money before he went.

This I send you by direction of all your friends. No attempt should be made with less than thirty thousand cavalry, from ten to fifteen thousand infantry to support them, amounting in all to forty or fifty five thousand troops. Do not under-rate their strength and desperation. Forces could probably be called to action in from 5 to 10 days, twenty-five thousand, mostly artillery.

As I am informed, Stearns for several years prior to his enlistment had been a workman in the mills at Manchester, this state, that his relatives mostly reside there, and that he has a very respectable woman for a wife, and also one child, in whose behalf this application is made.
That he deserted in the fall of 1862, and afterwards came to see his wife and child, to whom he is represented as being much attached, and after that probably went to Canada, though that is supposition.
I wish to make no apologies for desertions occurring at the present time. Their iniquity and punishment are well understood, but at the time Stearns deserted they were not generally regarded in the light in which they now are, and very severe punishment had, I believe, been but rarely inflicted prior to that time.

I supposed that he supposed that they would be raised upon precisely the same terms as other new recruits, and entitled to precisely the same bounties, no more, no less.

Andrew, Commdg. the Corps d'Afrique, the contents of the letter, and added that it would be for my personal advancement to be under Gen'l. B. He asked me if Gen. Butler promised to give me a Brig.

The Gen'l did me the honor to state that my chances here for such a Commission were good, and that he did not see why he should lose a good officer for the sake of Gen'l. Butler's or any other Department, and that an officer's preferences in the matter he should not consult. He further informed me that I might put in my resignation, but that he should disapprove it. I shall immediately put in my resignation, and it will be disapproved. I shall then send it on to friends at Washington, and move ""Heaven and Earth"" to effect my cherished desire of being with the General. ""Where there is a will there is a way,"" and my ""will"" is strong enough in this matter. He, Gen.

David Creamer, Esq., Asst. Assessor, 4th Division, 4th District, Va.
Dear Sir: I acknowledge the receipt of your circular letter, directing me to make out and return a list of my income for taxation from Internal Revenue.
I have no desire to escape or evade that taxation, and therefore shall not refuse to furnish a list when called upon by the person to whom I am authorized by law to give it. I am a citizen of Middlesex County, Mass., away from thence for what I hope is a very temporary purpose, not liable, and perhaps not likely to be at Fortress Monroe when the tax would be collectable; with no property upon which it might be levied except my personal wearing apparel and the horses and arms which I use in the service of the Government, and the few dollars balance of my pay which is not yet expended. Therefore it would seem that I am not amenable to taxation here, but shall be obliged to answer the call from my assessor at my home. I have no income here except my pay, which is duly taxed before I get it. It would be impossible for me to make an approximate statement of the income derived from my property in Mass., as that has been for almost three years past wholly managed by Agents, and without returns from them and an examination of their books, as much of it consists of bonds, uncollected interest money, and dividends upon stocks, for which I have no returns, it would be impossible for me to make an approximate statement.
I trust that you will see that my declining to send the list you require is from no want of respect to your office, or yourself, or any desire to evade proper taxation. Allow me also to call your attention to the fact that if I had such intent, while I remain in this District where martial law is predominant, and I am the executor thereof, it would be exceedingly difficult for you to collect the tax in the Civil Courts. I merely mention this to show that I should be taxed in Mass., where I
have property which is amenable for any process to answer taxation. I have the honor to be,

Dear Sir: At the suggestion of Capt. Graham, Provost Marshal of this place, whose debtor I am, I furnish you with a brief statement of facts that you may see how heavily your 49th order, &c. bears upon me.
Unfortunately for me, when the war commenced my property was about equally divided -- one half here, consisting in a few servants and 164 acres of land, the other portion was in the south, and consisted in a few hundred dollars, one servant, one horse and carriage, house, property, library, &c., to the amount of three thousand dollars.
My family, consisting of a wife, two daughters, and servant, were in the south when hostilities commenced. On the 21st day of May, 1861, we obtained permission of Commodore Stringham (who treated me very kindly) to pass to this place, where we have been ever since, and our conduct has been observed by your officer above named.
I, Sir, in early life had the benefit of military instruetion, and since this unhappy struggle commenced I have had several positions offered me, both while south and since I arrived
home, but have not accepted, nor have I been in military service of any kind since 1848.
I have never been a politician -- have not cast but one vote, which was for Bell and Everett for the Presidency, for the last seven years. Now, Sir, if this excites your surprise, allow me to allay it by saying I am a Minister of the Gospel, and have enough else to attend to.
Finally, my servants are all gone, and consequently my few acres are comparatively valueless -- already I am poor, and my helpless family are upon me.
Now, Sir, if complying with your order is the means of losing my property in the south, I know not what will stay me and my family of females while I am in the evening of life, unless we can find shelter in that Being in whom we have exhorted others to trust.
This is submitted with the full intention of abiding your decision. I am dear, Sir,

(Confidential of course). Washington, January 30th, 1864
My dear General: You will be astonished and probably disgusted to find a chap as I making to you suggestions, and nevertheless I dare to beard such a lion as you.
The future of the country, nay of this whole continent, is deeply, nay fearfully, intertwined with the coming presidential election. Energy, brains, comprehensiveness, farsightedness, prompt and clearsighted decision, broad organizing and administrative capacity, are among the paramount requisites in a future president. But not an atom of those qualities can be discovered in Mr. Lincoln, not even by any most powerful microscope.
I know somebody who masters them all, and besides he masters great many other qualities.
Whatever be the dirty activity of the politicians, I nevertheless rely upon the sound sense of the masses, and hope that in the last hour the people will go for the ablest man, provided that man accomplishes some brilliant action, and accomplishes it in the nick of time.
The whole present administration will not help any one to carry out some thing bold, dazzling, and decisive.
The army of the Potomac is to begin operations early in the spring. It is to be supposed that Lee will draw to him all the available forces. Then a lightning-like blow dealt from Fortress Monroe on Richmond, putting you in possession of the nest of the rebellion, transforms you into an irresistible favorite, and a candidate for the Presidency.
Of course Lincoln and his advisors will never put you in possession of sufficient means for such a coup, and still less would they assent that you should deal it.
Therefore -- if possible -- and possible it ought to be for such fertile brains as are yours -- you ought continually, slowly, but uninterruptedly increase your forces and resources; do it daily and hourly, and justify it by reasons plausible and palatable to our rulers.
When the hour comes, strike the blow without letting out
your secret. Report to the rulers -- when half way before Richmond -- telling them that no minute was to be lost, that you took the responsibility, as any delay -- even the shortest -- would have been fatal; etc., etc., etc.
You know better than I, that if the administration would wince and smart to find Richmond in your hands, on its shoulders the people will carry you into the White House.
This people and this continent must be rescued from the curse to have Mr. Lincoln re-elected. A great action, a great bold action, and Lincoln chances vanish as a nightmare.

Sir: The grounds upon which I judged it my duty to prohibit your doing business in North Carolina were because:
First. Your brother and partner in business, so far as any public notice goes, was engaged on the Rebel side in like
business, and therefore you were under very great temptations to send goods across the lines, having peculiar facilities, he being very near you.
Second. That your vessel, loaded with goods, had been put ashore under very suspicious circumstances.
Third. I had many complaints of the fact that you were dealing with the Rebels, in relation to goods furnished by you to them.
Fourth. As you are reported to me, and as you are advertised by your Northern friends, to be a merchant prince who had made four hundred thousand dollars by your trade, an amount which would satisfy a reasonable man's avarice; and as the trade is a special and limited one in North Carolina, I concluded that you at least had had your share in that trade, and might give way possibly to a less fortunate man.
Putting all these reasons together, I was forced to the conclusion that as the trade could only be by special permit, it would be better to permit that trade to those who were not embarrassed by the relations and suspicions which are attached to yourself. If the trade were an open one, to which all would have a right, I freely admit that I did not proceed so far in the investigation as to convict you beyond a reasonable doubt so as to take away your permit as for a conviction of crime.
But being a limited one, I thought the evidence against you was sufficient to my discretion and judgment, and therefore I gave the direction in regard to your business which I did. The same reasons, therefore, you will see at once, would apply to your doing a commission business down there, because when sending your vessels with your goods on Commission to your correspondent, your Captain may run them ashore for the Rebels to capture them, as he did the last time; or your correspondents may transfer them to your brother within the Rebel lines, as you are supposed to have done; or your correspondent may carry on the business of smuggling goods through the lines, which you are accused of having the means and the knowledge how to do.
You will therefore see that it is best that you should conduct your business enterprises in another quarter, where you will not be supposed to be under the same temptations and suspicions as in North Carolina. And if your business success in North Carolina was due simply to your business capacity, capital, and energy, the fact that you can meet with the same success in other quarters will be the best answer to the accusations
made against the manner of your trade there. I have the honor to be

In the matter of Margaret Newton, and the further execution of the order of Brig. Gen. Wild to take possession of her property as a military necessity
Mrs. Newton having submitted her title to the property to the Major General Commanding, it appears that the house in which she resides, and the subject of the Order, is vested, one undivided half in Mrs. Newton, by several deeds of trust, and the other undivided moiety invested in her infant child, the daughter of Courtney A. Newton, her late husband, a private in the Confederate Army, who died in March last, of wounds received while fighting against his country, at the battle near Sharpsburg. It appears that Mrs. Margaret Newton has taken the Oath prescribed by the Proclamation of the President. Without discussing the question, whether by the Act of Congress in regard to confiscation, and the Proclamation of the President and the expiration of the sixty days after the 21st of June, 1862, there was any power of inheritance in that property by the heir of Courtney A. Newton, it is sufficient to observe that Margaret Newton has an undivided estate, which, if she were loyal, would entitle her to possession against all the world.
She having taken the Oath, it must be presumed under the Proclamation of the President that she is restored to her present rights of property. The question then presented itself, whether there is such a military necessity as would justify the taking of the house of a person of known loyalty for the the purpose indicated by the Order of Gen. Wild to wit: a residence for himself and military family.
A military convenience is to be carefully distinguished from a military necessity. While the Comd'g General would have no difficulty in taking the houses of persons of known disloyalty for the convenience of his Officers and his men, nothing but an urgent necessity would justify the taking of houses from loyal persons. For example, were his officers and men without shelter in an inclement season, the Commanding General would feel justified in taking the buildings of loyal persons for
that purpose, or if they needed hospitals; but that would be upon the belief that a just claim would accrue to the owner from the United States.
But the Comd'g General does not believe that Gen. Wild in this case would for himself take such a building for his personal use and that of his Staff, and subject the United States to a valid claim for the full rent thereof. Therefore, as it seems to the Comd'g General, if the property in this instance were so taken, such a valid claim would exist in favor of Mrs. Newton, so far as any facts have been presented.
The General has no hesitation in setting aside the Order of Gen. Wild in this behalf, who no doubt ordered the property taken upon the supposition that the sole title was in Courtney A. Newton, the husband, who had forfeited all rights to it by his rebellious acts. Of course this determination can have no effect upon the claims of the United States and of Mrs. Newton, to be settled under due process before the proper Courts. A copy of this determination and Order is furnished Mrs. Newton for her information."

"February 2, 1864","From General I. J. Wistar
Telegram. Yorktown, Feb. 2d, 1864, 11 P. M.
Major Gen. B. F. Butler.
General: Enough of Bottom's Bridge remains for one wagon to pass at a time. Market carts cross it daily. One-half (longitudinally) is interrupted by the removal of alternate planks.
There is a good ford about fifty (50) yards below the bridge at low stages of the stream. I cannot get direct information of its present condition, but think it must be practicable. I can get no late information of Long Bridge 7 miles below or should prefer it, as presenting less danger through the telegraphic communication by York River R. R. To cross at the ""James"" or ""Forge"" bridge would be a longer route, and would give sufficient alarm to Chapin's farm, via Charles City C. H. where they are now doubtless wide-awake.
I have a man who will undertake to cut the telegraph between Meadow Station and Richmond at one o'clk. A. M. on any given morning, with 36 hours' start. He belongs to 11th Pa. Cav., & is a Virginian enlisted in Gloucester Co. Col. Spear says ""trust him."" When I open the matter fully to him I will promise him $250 if successful., I shall send 200 Infantry, under Lt. Col. Perry, 139 N. Y., with 12 hours' start, to go through the woods and get in rear of the New Kent Picket, which I am in strong hopes of accomplishing. I shall then take twenty picked infantry of same party up, behind as many cavalry men, and endeavor to do the same at Baltimore roads, but have not much hope of success there.
If it fails, there is nothing for it but a rush on Bottom's Bridge, where there is a picket of about 20 men, occupying a log house at the further end of the bridge on the left hand side, and 200 or 300 more on the hill about a mile beyond, when we must either surprise or race with the telegraph, if the plan for cutting it fails.
From the moment of our appearance at the bridge (supposing we stop the picket at the Baltimore roads) I estimate it will require the enemy to get to Meadow station, wake up the operators at both ends of the line, communicate the message, signal it by lanterns to Battery No. 2, and get its garrisons in fighting condition, &c., &c., 1½ hours. We ought to be there by that time, distance eleven miles.
If we fail to do that, we must dash by or around the battery
in two or three columns. They only have (9) nine guns there in the three batteries, & I think the shooting of the Richmond Battalion at 6 A. M. will be bad if they try to fire on all at once.
If the only additional cavalry you can send will be the 5th Pa., they might as well come by water to Yorktown as not, provided they can all come at once, & I have timely notice. I now have 400 Cavalry at Gloucester C. H., after two rebel companies near there.
The exercise will benefit their horses which are good, but I should have timely notice in order to concentrate, in readiness to go right on upon the arrival of the 5th Pa. If I succeed in a timely concentration & start I am not much afraid of anything except the York River telegraph. Only one thing is absolutely certain, & that is that we can't accomplish anything worth while without some risk, and that we can't do it if we don't try.

General: Your note of this morning by Major Haggerty is received.
In saying Friday in my telegram I mean to concentrate on that evening at the lines -- to march there on Saturday at 10 A. M., and strike the blow at R. on Sunday morning at 6 A. M.
If Gen. Meade coöperates he should be moving at this moment. If he has no accumulation of supplies at his front, and he probably has not, it will take him some time to make an earnest movement, and a detected & understood feint is worse than nothing.
I have, however, made my calculations without expecting anything from him, and whatever he may do will be a gain. About 6,000 men went South through Richmond at the end of week before last, and on last Monday week 2,000 others, coming from the South, passed through R. to replace them. Those 6,000 men, with what have been drawn from the Appomattox line and the Blackwater, & possibly a few previously in observation in front of Newbern, are, I suspect, about what is in front of Gen'l Palmer.
One Brigade at least of Pickett's is at Chapin's farm, & part or the whole of another is at Richmond & Hanover Junction. His artillery is at Chapin's & Richmond, & perhaps Petersburg. I know of some at both the two first-named places.
It is a great risk to send men to cut the telegraph, lest if taken they should confess in their ignorance, under the supposition that it would exonerate them from the character of ""spies."" If they did, the enemy could draw but one inference.
I think, however, I could find two to send unknown to each other. They will start to-morrow night.
How are we to know whether they cut it properly or not? Of course they will say so. I mean in reference to the payment of reward, for I shall act as though I knew the telegraph to be unharmed.
My Surgeon-in-Chief has telegraphed for (20) twenty new stretchers, which I hope will come on tomorrow's boat (Thursday). I am,

Despatches from Brigadier-General Palmer, at Newbern, dated 2d February, at 5.15 P. M. The post of Newport, between Newbern and Beaufort, is expected to fall. Colonel Jourdan still holds Morehead City, but may have to evacuate and go to Fort Macon. The naval gunboat ""Underwriter"" has been surprised by the enemy and blown up near Newbern. The railroad is probably cut off between Newbern and Beaufort. The river is still open. Palmer has 3,500 men under his command. They have provisions for 6,000 for ninety days. I will endeavor to reënforce Newbern by a company of heavy artillery, which is the arm they will need. I telegraphed Major-General Sedgwick as you desired, but have received no answer.

Your despatch of last evening is received. The only troops sent from Lee's army on the Rapidan to North Carolina are two brigades of infantry and one or two regiments of cavalry,
numbering in all between 3,000 and 4,000 men. No portion of Lee's troops in Richmond, unless some of the troops mentioned above have been stopped there. The information upon this head is exact and positive. Two brigades of Pickett's division have been sent recently from James River or the vicinity of Richmond to North Carolina. Lee's army is in my front, on the Rapidan, the advance corps of the two armies being from three to four hours' march apart. The condition of the roads and the present state of the weather render an attempt at a flank movement impossible. The Rapidan in my front is so strongly intrenched that a demonstration upon it would not disturb Lee's army.

Sir: Your letter in regard to the report of Gen. Graham's expedition, in which it was said that five Jews were captured, trying to run the blockade, inquiring of me why I have specified the religion of these contraband traders, and commenting upon the act as if I wished to make invidious religious distinctions, is received.
The manner in which the phrase got itself into the telegraph reports was very simple. The report of the return of the expedition was made to me, and as it was made I dictated portions of it to the telegraph, using the words of the Report, so that it was in fact done without thought on my part, and only in the course of business, as I should have mentioned any other fact reported to me by my subordinate when reporting to my superior.
But since my attention has been drawn to it by your comments, and others of the press, I really do not see any reason for changing the phrase. It was meant when used to designate nationality, although not religion, -- as one would say five Irishmen, five Germans, or five Italians. I have always considered the Jews a nationality, although possessing no country. The closeness with which they cling together, the aid which they afford each other on all proper and sometimes improper occasions, the fact that nearly all of them pursue substantially the same employment so far as I have known them -- that of traders, merchants, and bankers, the very general obedience to the prohibition against marriage with Gentiles, their faith which looks forward to the time when they are to be gathered together in the former land of their nation, all serve to show a closeness of kindred and nation among the Hebrews, and a greater homogeneity than belongs to any other nation, although its people live in closer proximity. So that while I' disclaim all intention of any reflection upon their national religion, which was the foundation and typical of that of the Christian world, and holding to the doctrines of Christianity with reverence for the Savior, no one can stigmatize all Jews, yet one may be reasonably permitted, in speaking of that nation, to suppose there may be in all the Jews of the South, two of whom certainly are in the Confederate Cabinet, at least five who might attempt to carry on a contraband trade.
Because it may be reverently remembered that when the Savior aided by omniscience undertook to choose twelve confidential friends from among that nation, he got one that was a ""thief and had a devil."" I have the honor to be,

I see a report in the newspapers that you are about to declare Newbern a free port. That can only be done by allowing free entrance into Hatteras Inlet, and when a vessel is once inside it has two hundred miles of inland navigation, bordered by the enemy's shores, from which to choose a point to land its goods for smuggling purposes.
To blockade that inland navigation effectually would take more vessels than the blockade at Wilmington.
Newbern is now besieged by the enemy. Having charge of its military defence, I must respectfully protest against such a declaration. As no vessels drawing more than eight feet of water can go over the swash at Hatteras, such declaration would be mocking so far as foreign trade is concerned.

Brig. Genl. Wistar, Commdg. Expeditionary Division,
Yorktown, Va.
My Dear Wistar: So far as I can see, everything is done that can be done within our means for the move on Richmond. Therefore we are to go forward to endeavor to do the services proposed; 1st, to relieve our prisoners who must otherwise, it seems to me, of necessity be starved. Lee is already asking his soldiers to live on half rations, can he give more to our soldier prisoners?
2nd. To destroy the public buildings, arsenals, Tredegar Iron works, depots, railroad equipage and commissary stocks of the Rebels, and thus cripple their resources.
3rd. To capture some of the leaders of the rebellion, so that at least we can have means to meet their constant threats of retaliation and hanging of our men white and black. If any of the more prominent can be brought off, I believe a blow will be given to the rebellion from which it will never recover.
There is one point and one only upon which I have not
consulted with you fully as I could wish, and that is why I have marked this private, because of its delicacy. If you live, I have every confidence that all will be done that can be done for the success of your expedition, all that courage, coolness, comprehension, and skill can do, but if misfortune meet you, what then? Have you subordinates that can fully take your place? Have they been so fully instructed in our plans as to escape confusion? Should not at least three officers of every separate detachment be instructed in the objects and aims of that force, with orders to carry them out in the event of one falling or two?
Do you desire me to send you anybody as second in command -- in case you are disabled by shell explosion or accident? If so, name him. To you shall be the honor of the execution of the enterprise in any event. Trust me with the utmost confidence in the matter, and I will give you whatever I can that you desire.
Finally, may God preserve you in an undertaking which promises so much for the cause of the country if successful.
We can have no aid or coöperation. I have telegraphed to General Halleck to order Meade's Army to make at least a feint, and have rec'd in reply a request that I would ""telegraph myself to General Sedgwick for coöperation,"" but I am not commanding General of the Army, and Sedgwick will not obey me. I have telegraphed to Sedgwick, however, asking him, as Newbern is besieged, if he can give me aid and relief by a threatening demonstration on Richmond, and if that can be done Saturday, but have received no reply. ""Another man from England"" might diminish the daring of the achievement, and therefore our plan may not be indispensable to success.
Your idea to march on Saturday is the correct one. If this weather holds, we must not lose it; you will be in time exactly. The barometer now promises fair, dry weather, the colder the better. Success attend you is the earnest prayer of yours
Very truly,
Benj. F. Butler, Maj. Gen. Comdg."
"February 4, 1864","From General I. J. Wistar to General Butler
Yorktown, Virginia, Feby. 4th, 1864
General: Accept my grateful and sincere thanks for your letter of today, just received by despatch boat, and for all your manifold kindness and consideration ever since I happily
came a second time under your command. A thousand false impressions have been removed from my mind, and it shall be a business of my life to assist friends in doing what you will not -- except by the slow testimony of actions and services -- do for yourself, viz. remove similar ones from the minds of others.
Respecting a suitable second in command, the matter is too important to be left to me. You should and will decide. I will only remark in that connection that Col. West and Col. Duncan command my two infantry brigades, and I have every confidence in both. To-morrow night I shall go with them, map in hand at Williamsburg, over every detail and every contingency.
Col. Spear is thoroughly instructed and cross examined by me already. On Saturday morning I shall call the Cavalry Colonels and Cavalry Officers of the striking detachment, and go over everything. I have some guides, and have despatched two men unknown to each other tonight to cut the wire between Meadow Station and Richmond on Saturday night, between dark and midnight. Lt. Col. Perry, of 139th N. Y., with 200 Infantry, starts at 10 P. M. Friday evening, with a good guide to get in rear of the New Kent picket at (9) P. M. Saturday evening. At 2 same night we make the attempt to surprise Bottom's Bridge, with the hope of striking Richmond at 5 A. M. following. If the principal cavalry officers are brave, the thing must succeed.
I believe I dare not leave the supporting force in position at Bottom's Bridge unless the circumstances of the moment justify my accompanying the Cavalry from there. Such is not my present intention.
I have weighed it well. In the confusion of the moment, even if I were present, we should have to depend on previously instructed detachment commanders, while if an accident happens to the infantry and I not there to remedy it, Fortress Monroe and its dependencies are left entirely uncovered and without troops.
I ought now to inform you of the provision left to local defence.
1st. 150 effectives of 16 N. Y. 26 Arty. and one battery of field Artillery (two-thirds manned) and five heavy guns in the new citadel (unfinished) at Gloucester Point, a strong place.
2nd. 100 of same with 50 provost guard and one-half of a
four gun light battery (half manned) at Yorktown, with say 200 convalescents and sick, besides teamsters, &c., Capt. Brooks, Provost Marshal, a good officer in command.
3rd. 550 effective of N. Y. Arty., with one section of first-rate light Artillery and eight guns in position at Fort Magruder (a strong place) and its line of redoubts, besides some sick and dismounted Cavalry, and one or two good officers acquainted with the field and sweep of the guns. Fort Magruder contains good water and some accumulation of rations and ammunition, not much of the latter -- enough I think.
They should hold out for some days against any moderate force with light guns, and it will take a good while for them to bring down any other kind.
If I and my troops meet with an accident, there should be a good officer sent there until you can reinforce. I really have no misgivings whatever, but regard such as a most remote possibility.
I hope and verily believe that I have forgotten nothing, and that every possible contingency has received consideration. Accidents may mar anything. We may stumble in Richmond on 10,000 men going to or returning from Newbern, but we have a fair right to expect as many accidents for us as against us.
One last request. If you hear favorably from me, will you quiet the anxiety of my wife by a telegraphic line to care of Robert Toland, 1213 Spruce Street, Philadelphia.
With renewed and heartfelt thanks for your uniform kindness, and not the least of them, -- this opportunity given me, -- permit me to call myself your

Dear Sir: You will pardon the liberty I take in addressing you, being a total stranger; but I consider it my duty to draw your attention to the dangerous consequences which may attend your brother, Col. Butler's, exposure to this changeable climate. His health is not improving, and I fear that if he remains here it may cost him his life.
When I arrived from California, and found him failing, I tried to persuade him to leave at once for a milder climate, -- Cuba, or some other island. My persuasion was of no avail.
The Colonel, not thinking that he is so ill, believes that a few days will make it all right. I have no confidence in his physician, -- he pretends to cure him with homeopathy. I believe the Colonel's life can only be saved, for some time at least, by his immediately going into a milder climate. I intended to see his physician, but was told by Mr. Richardson and Capt. Allen that he will not give an answer to any of them, even insults them, asking them what right they have to question, they not being relatives. None of the above named gentlemen could induce the Colonel to leave for a milder climate, -- so I believe the only remedy is to write to you. He will listen to you, and take your advice. Mrs. Butler is too distant to arrive in time to influence him, even if we telegraphed her at once. I take a sincere interest in Col. Butler's welfare; he is an old friend, a neighbor, and it was at my suggestion that he settled in Sonoma. Our families are on the most intimate footing. I would consider it a neglect of duty as a friend not to do all in my power to serve him, and his family. Being a stranger to you, I may here state that I can have no object but pure friendship to inform you of the situation of your brother. I am a Californian, and am sent here as a delegate to Congress from the Vine Growers of California, to see that the internal revenue tax on wine is modified by Congress, that this enterprise be not crushed in its commencement. Holding the largest vineyard in California, I readily undertook this long voyage. Finding the Colonel worse on my return from Washington, I have determined to write to you. Of course, the Colonel is unaware of this. I would suggest to you to write to his physician, demanding a straight answer. As his brother, you have a right to know what is his opinion.

I SEND enclosed for your perusal the information I have acquired of the enemies' forces and dispositions about Richmond. The letter commencing ""dear Sir"" on the first page is a cypher letter to me from a lady in Richmond with whom I
am in correspondence. The bearer of the letter brought me a private token showing that he was to be trusted.
There are not now in Lee's army or about Richmond thirty thousand men. I can get no co-operation from Sedgwick.
Forty thousand men on the South side of the James would be sufficient for the object of taking and permanently holding of Richmond. The roads have been good up to to-day. You will see that the prisoners are to be sent away to Georgia. Now is the time to strike. On Sunday I shall make a dash with six thousand men, all I have that can possibly be spared. If we win, I will pay the cost; if we fail, it will be at least an attempt to do our duty and rescue our friends.
Newbern is relieved, and I believe permanently. I have marked this ""private and immediate"" so that it shall at once come into your hands.

1 knows this
is true. Are building batteries on the Danville Road. This from Quaker.
Beware of new and rash council. Beware! This I send you by direction of all your friends.
No attempt should be made with less than thirty thousand Cavalry -- from ten to fifteen thousand infantry to support them, amounting in all to forty or forty-five thousand troops.
Do not underrate their strength and desperation. Forces could probably be called into action in from five to ten days, twenty-five thousand, mostly artillery. Hoke's and Kemper's Brigade gone to North Carolina. Pickett's in or about Petersburg.
Three regiments of Cavalry disbanded by Gen. Lee for want of horses. Morgan is applying for a thousand choice men for a raid.
Feb. 4th, 1864
Gen. Well my boy, where did you get that letter from?
Miss Van Lieu gave it to me. I stayed with Miss Van Lieu for a week before I came away. Miss Lizzie said she wanted to send you a letter, and I said I would bring it. Miss Lizzie said you would take care of me. I left there last Saturday night. Miss Lizzie told me what to tell you.
Gen. Well, what did she tell you to say? You need have no fear here.
She told me to tell you of the situation of the Army. Mr. Palmer got all the information he could for you. Lee has got about twenty-five thousand men, there are about fifteen thousand men at Petersburg. The City Battalion and two companies, Maryland companies, are at Richmond -- and about eighteen hundred or two thousand at Chapin's and Drury's Bluff.
Mr. Palmer said there were two Brigades gone to North Carolina about a week before I left. He found out though, just before I came away, that one of them had stopped at Petersburg. The two Brigades that went were Hoke's and Kemper's. He thought that what available force could be got into Richmond in four or five days was from twenty-five to thirty thousand men. He said to say to you that Richmond could be taken easier now than at any time since the war began. He thought that it would take about ten thousand infantry.
Gen. Miss Van Lieu says something in her letter about Quaker?
There is a man there goes by the name of Quaker. That is not his name, but he says he does not wish anyone to know his name -- he does not wish to be known by any other name.
They are sending off the Federal prisoners to Georgia. Mr. Palmer said he had understood that Lee was there in Richmond, in secret session there but he said that was not reliable.
Lee has about twenty-five thousand available men. Miss Van Lieu said not to undervalue Lee's force. Quaker said his plan to take Richmond would be to make a feint on Petersburg. Let Meade engage Lee on the Rappahannock -- send two or three hundred men -- and land them at the White House on the other side of Richmond, so as to attract attention -- then have ten thousand Cavalry to go up in the evening and then rush into Richmond the next morning.
Gen. -- How did you get through?
Mr. Holmes got a man to bring me -- to guide me -- he paid him one thousand dollars in Confederate money -- and he brought me to the Chickahominy and left me there. He fooled me -- I came across the river -- I got a boat.
I don't think there are any men on the Chickahominy -- or only a few Cavalry. There are none nearer than Lee's Army. At Chapin's Farm there is about a Regiment. He told me to tell you that Drury's Bluff is the strongest point -- he said you must come around Richmond on the other side.
Morgan is applying for a thousand men. The papers say he is going to make a raid into Kentucky. I don't believe that, though, for if he was the papers would not say so.
Miss Van Lieu said that all the women ought to be kept from passing from Baltimore to Richmond. She said they did a great deal of harm. She also said that there was a Mrs. Graves who carried a mail through to Portsmouth. She hoped you would catch her. The last time she brought a mail into Portsmouth she came in a wagon selling corn.

My Dear Captain: I have taken an early opportunity to answer your inquiries. My grandfather's name was Zephaniah Butler. He was born in Woodbury, Conn. He had brothers, Benjamin and Silas. His father's name was Malachi. I do not know what the names of any of his sisters were, but my
oldest aunt, father's sister, who died at the age of 82, some twenty years ago, was named Susannah. It is quite probable that my grandfather might have had a sister Susannah, from whom the name came.
As my grandfather left Connecticut somewhere about 1759, more than a century ago, and his brother Benjamin with him, and settled in Nottingham, and had no communication with the Connecticut part of the family since, I am not able to give further information. I should be much pleased however, to have you trace the connection.

I AM sorry that my message was not delivered as I gave it. I was informed that you were sick, and had been sick for several months at home. A large number of the sick and wounded have been transferred to Point Lookout. I therefore said to Mr. Cross that if you were likely to be sick for any length of time it would be better for you to resign your position, because there was a necessity for a chaplain there, and that if you were a true servant of your Master, finding yourself in the way of the spiritual interest of your parish, you would resign, and that I wished him to say to you that if you resigned for ill-health, and that afterwards you recovered your health, I would endeavor to have you appointed there or somewhere else.
This action on your part of course involved no neglect but simply a misfortune. I said I wished him to tell you this kindly and informally, not officially, as he seemed to be a friend of yours, because I did not wish there should be any official communications, that if you, with a reasonable prospect of not being able to do your duty in the service because of ill-health, still continue to hold on to your position, and thus deprive your charge of sick and wounded of all spiritual
assistance, such course would be sufficient evidence to me that you were not a true servant of your Master, and therefore it would become my duty to displace you. Now, I submit to you whether this action of mine was not following out the rule laid down by your great teacher ""Do as you would be done by""?

Dear Sir: I enclose you a commission as local Special Agent of the Treasury. I want you to consult with the Provost Marshal and see that the business is done in your counties as it is done here. All the machinery of Special Agents must be done away with. They are only applicable, as you will see, in parts of the country between the military lines of the United States and the military lines of the enemy, a sort of neutral ground, called supply districts. They are to protect the Government, special agents to examine the loyalty of persons. All the persons in your counties are loyal, or if they are not, if you will let me know, they shall be so or leave. Therefore, it is a portion of the state coming within Section 8 and 32 of the Regulations. All goods that come into those Districts must have permits from these Head Quarters, in exactly the fashion that they come into Norfolk, for I see no reason why the eastern shore of Virginia should be upon one ground, and the District of Norfolk upon another ground.

Hon. E. M. Stanton, Secretary of War
In obedience to your order I report in regard to Isaiah Respies, ex-Mayor of Washington, North Carolina.
A simple statement of the facts will settle all necessity of examination into his sanity.
When on an official tour of inspection in Nov. in Washington, it came to my knowledge that a raid had been made by the 3rd New York Cavalry, in which the contents of the vaults of the Tarboro Bank were captured, to the amount of a number of hundreds of thousands of dollars, and that certain of the citizens of Washington had been buying the money of the soldiers, and it was alleged that certain of the officers had been embezzling it. Among the citizens was indicated Isaiah Respies. I sent for him, took him on board the boat, and while going down the river examined him personally as to these facts and circumstances. He admitted that he had bought about twenty thousand dollars of the money of soldiers. He denied knowing who they were, said they went into a private room at the hotel, and there made the bargain. I asked him if he had not heard that this money was stolen on a raid. He said he had. I asked him if he did not know that the very money that he was buying was not stolen on this raid by the soldiers; after some hesitation he admitted he did know it. I then asked him to account where the money was, as it was not likely that Confederate money was passed within our lines.
He undertook to account for it. He said that he paid four thousand dollars of it to his Counsel in Richmond. I told him then I wanted the whereabouts of the remainder. He said that he had invested a portion of it in some tobacco. I asked him where the tobacco was. He said it was in his store. I asked him where he had invested it in tobacco. He said in Richmond, through a friend. I asked him how he got the tobacco through our lines. He said it came by the ""underground railroad."" I then sent and ordered the tobacco seized as part of the proceeds of the stolen money.
I asked him how he came to buy the tobacco. He said that he had a permit to trade. I asked him to show me the permit to trade, and afterwards he did so. I asked him if he did not know that he had not a permit to trade in the Rebel lines.
He said he supposed it would be all right if he could get
the tobacco through. I then asked him more particularly how he got the tobacco through. He said it was brought to a friend house near our lines, and brought across the river at night. I told him I thought he ought to be punished: First, for buying stolen property knowing it to be stolen, and Secondly, for trading with the enemy outside of the lines in violation of the Treasury Regulations.
He then claimed that he was a very good Union man, and had been tried for his life for his love for the Union in Richmond, first being sent to Raleigh and afterwards to Richmond, where he was tried. That he took part of this money to pay his Counsel, and that he had been acquitted: and he claimed great consideration from me because he was so tried. I told him if he had been convicted it would have been some evidence that he was a good Union man, but as he had made a Confederate Judge believe that he was a good Confederate, it was a case in point against him.
This examination was reduced to writing shortly after by Col. Olcott, and made the foundation of subsequent proceedings against Respies.
Respies is no more insane than I am, except insanus fame auri. I think he would sell his master for thirty pieces of silver.
I have tried too many cases and set up too many defences of insanity in criminal cases not to have some judgment in the matter. He deserves his punishment, but I will discharge him from further imprisonment if for no other reason than that for which the unjust judge granted the widow's suit, because Respies' friends ""by continual coming weary me.""

My dear Sir: I enclose a copy of the National Republican, which contains an article, entitled ""Suggestions concerning the further prosecution of the War,"" written by me, and, of course, in the line of my thoughts. The article was not officially inspired as some of the northern journals have suggested. I do not write upon terms with anybody. The leading idea, that we should abandon all thoughts of going to Richmond over the country and take possession of James River, is an old view which I tried to impress upon the President more than a year ago. His answer was that the line of the railroad from Richmond to Petersburg was fortified, very strong, etc. My answer to that is that the line is too long to admit of its defence without the use of twice the force necessary to menace it from one terminal to the other, if a lodgement were made above the mouth of the Appomattox.

Our expedition, organized as stated in my despatch, left Williamsburg at 10 o'clock on Saturday.
Arrived at Bottom's Bridge, within 12 miles of Richmond, at the time indicated, at 2½ o'clock Sunday morning, but found the enemy posted there in a strong force, continually receiving accessions from Richmond by rail. Waited till daylight, then found they had -- Regts. of Infantry, 1 of Cavalry, & 4 Batteries of Artillery, the bridge taken up, and all the fords effectually obstructed.
An attempt was made gallantly to charge over one of them by a detachment of 1st New York Mounted Rifles, under Major Whelan, with a loss of 9 killed & wounded. At 12, the Infantry supports arrived within 7 miles, having made a march of 40 miles in 27 hours. Gen'l Wistar says that with the Infantry he could have forced the position, but as the enemy had received some intimation of the approach of the expedition, the delay had defeated the main object, which was a dash at Richmond.
Our forces then returned to New Kent C. H. Were followed by the enemy, who made an attack, but were handsomely repulsed with loss on their side. 3rd New York were under Col. Lewis, assisted by one piece of Belger's Battery.
Our forces are returning at their leisure unmolested. The Cavalry have arrived at Williamsburg to-day about 3 o'clock. Thus it will be seen that the Cavalry in less than 50 hours have marched more than 140 miles. Flag of Truce boat is
just in from Richmond, bringing the Examiner of Monday morning, which contains this sentence, ""Some days ago a report was obtained by the authorities here from a Yankee deserter, that the enemy was contemplating a raid, in considerable force, on Richmond. The report obtained consistency from a number of circumstances, & impressed the authorities to such a degree that a disposition of forces was made to anticipate the supposed designs of the enemy.""

Headquarters Army of the Potomac, February 12, 1864
Major Gen. H. W. Halleck, General-in-Chief
In reply to your telegram of last evening, I have to state the best chance for a successful attack on the Rapidan lay in the fact that not more that a brigade or a brigade and a half was holding the works at Morton's Ford; that the nearest re-enforcements (not counting the brigade or brigade and a half holding the works at Raccoon Ford, which could not be removed without abandoning that part of the line) were from 5 to 6 miles off (two brigades back of Somerville and Robertson's Ford); that the other posts of Ewell's corps were from 10 to 12 miles off, and Hill's corps as far off, if not farther; that the appearance of our troops at Morton's Ford, on the
Rapidan, was a complete surprise, and if 1,000 or 1,200 men had rushed to the enemy's works at that point they could have been carried, and if the whole army could have been on the river, with the artillery and ammunition and other fighting trains ready to follow up the taking of the works at Morton's Ford, Lee's army would have had to fight without the advantage of the strong position of the Rapidan, rendered vastly stronger by intrenchments. In other words, gaining the intrenchments at Morton's Ford, with the whole army to follow it up, would have turned his intrenched position of the Rapidan and its appendages. Second, the condition of the roads, country, and weather during the time that co-operation with General Butler was proposed and executed was such as to render the secret and rapid movement of this army impracticable. Third, the despatch from General Butler received Friday night requested that the demonstration by this army should be made the next day (Saturday), and without regard to the weather; it stated that he hoped to strike his point Sunday morning at 6 o'clock. The demonstration, to be in time for General Butler's purpose (and it was made for no other object), could only be effected by using the two corps nearest the Rapidan -- the First and Second, -- without bringing in their detached brigades, picket guards, &c., and by leaving their camps standing, with guards, &c., and sending parts of two divisions of cavalry to make demonstrations on the Rapidan above and below, by which the operations would be prolonged through Saturday. Fourth, the requirements of General Butler, just stated, rendered it impossible to take advantage of a surprise at Morton's Ford if one should be made, since the army could not be got to the river in time, if, indeed, it was practicable to get it there at all. Fifth, the co-operation with General Butler spoiled the chance for a successful attack by giving the enemy proof that we could surprise them at Morton's Ford, and by indicating to them what they should do, by a new arrangement of troops and new defensive works, to prevent a repetition of it. They have already thrown up a new rifle-pit close to the ford. A mere cavalry reconnaissance last fall caused them to extend the intrenchments on the Rapidan up Mine Run several miles. A similar reconnaissance at an earlier day toward their left caused them to intrench the crossing of Blue River, and make other defensive dispositions. Sixth, in my telegram to you of the 5th instant I stated, ""Demonstrations in our front at the present time may, however,
spoil the chances for the future."" The conditions of a successful attack, so far as they relate to the condition, position, and sense of security of Lee's army, existed already. The conditions relating to the state of the roads and the weather, which rendered it practicable to move this army secretly and rapidly to the Rapidan, did not exist, and until they did no plan of attack could be prepared with any view to its execution, nor could any time be proposed for its execution. It was believed, however, that the opportunity would occur.

Sir: During the recent attack upon Newbern about forty men of Co. ""F."" 2d. N. C. U. Vols., were captured by the enemy near Bachelor's Creek. Two or three of them subsequently escaped, and report that a massacre of the entire number of our men (2nd. N. C.) taken, was contemplated.
I am advised to write you requesting that immediate measures may be adopted, if not already too late, to prevent the execution of these soldiers. But very few of them, if any, are amenable to the rebels as deserters, under the most liberal concession of belligerent rights; not one instance having occurred within my knowledge of the enlistment into this Regiment of any man who had taken upon himself the obligation
of an oath of military service under the so-called ""Confederate"" government. I found in my recruiting conscript deserters and other refugees, fleeing from the rebel army, that no man whom I received, had ever formally and strictly become a Confederate soldier. Some, it is true, had been pressed in, and had actually though not voluntarily been in that service.
I fear that these fearful rumors of bloody punishment may be in some part if not wholly true. To save delay I write thus directly to your Head Quarters, in the hope that prompt action may be taken by Gen. Butler.
The captives were all regularly enlisted in the Regiment, and properly mustered into the United States service. The protection of the Government has been solemnly pledged to them. I did not move one step in recruiting until I had the recognition and approval of Maj. General Peck, who explicitly permitted the enlistment by me and my agents of conscript deserters. This permission was given in writing, and is now in my possession.

Headquarters, Dept. Va., & N. C., Fort Monroe, Feb. 10th, 1864
W. E. Bond, J. I. Carmen, Jos. F. Waff
Gentlemen: In answer to the inquiry proposed by you as a committee from the citizens of Chowan County, N. C., I respectfully answer to the first, viz: First. ""What will be the policy pursued towards the citizens of Chowan if they continue peaceable and quiet, abstaining from all acts of hostility?""
Answer. That if the inhabitants of that county remain peaceable and quiet, abstaining from all acts of hostility, aiding blockade runners, or concealing guerillas, they will not be interfered with by the troops of the United States, as we have no occasion to go into any parts of the county where no acts of hostility are committed against the Government.
Second. To the second question, viz: ""Will expeditions be projected into our county, and if found necessary to make them, will peaceable citizens and private property be protected and respected?""
 -- 403  -- Answer. That unless some portion of Chowan Co. is occupied by some forces or signal parties of the Confederates, or some parties hostile to the United States take refuge in that county, no expedition will be sent therein, and if it becomes necessary to send expeditions there the private persons and property of peaceable citizens will be protected, and the expeditions be conducted on the principles laid down in General Order No. 10. current series, a copy of which is hereby enclosed.
Third. To the third question, viz: ""Was not the order requiring and enforcing the oath of allegiance designed to apply only to persons embraced within your pickets lines?""
Answer. That as the Government of the United States cannot throw in fact its protection around the citizens of Chowan, they are excused from the corresponding obligation of actively expressing their allegiance to the Government which might endanger their safety from the enemies of the United States, and therefore the oath of allegiance will not be required of the citizens of Chowan Co. unless they are brought within our lines.
Fourth. To the fourth question: ""Cannot trade with Norfolk be opened and allowed to the people of Chowan; and on what terms and under what restrictions?""
Answer. That trade may be carried on with Norfolk under the same provisions as those given to the citizens of Pasquotank Co., as expressed in a letter given to them, a duplicate of which is addressed to this Committee.
Fifth. In answer to the fifth question: ""Cannot servants who have left us be prevented from returning; or at least be restrained from unnecessary offensiveness and actual outrage to feelings or property of their former owners?""
Answer. I have the honor to say that the negroes who have left the Co. will not be allowed to return unless by stealth, and if upon returning in such manner they outrage the property or persons of their former owners, it is hoped that they will be arrested and held by the citizens of the Co., and information sent to these Headquarters in order that they may be sent for and punished.
Sixth. The sixth question is a more difficult one, viz: ""Can our citizens be permitted to fish with seines and nets on Albermarle Sound and on the Eastern side of Chowan River, and on what terms and under what restrictions?""
Answer. It is understood by the Commanding General that
fishing with seines and nets in the sounds and rivers affords a large quantity of provision for the inhabitants of that part of N. C. The difficulty is therefore that that provision thus obtained may be stored in large amounts, and tempt raids there by the Confederates to the destruction of the peace of the county, requiring an armed force to be sent there to meet those raids on our part unless we quietly permit supplies for the rebels' army to be drawn from that source. Now, this is entirely irrespective of the good faith of the inhabitants of that county, for if they accumulate provisions with the intent to use them in their families, they may be taken from them justifiably under the laws of the war to support the rebel armies.
These circumstances surround the use of the waters adjoining Chowan Co., with difficulties, and by means of our gunboats any use of the waters may be very easily prevented, but the Commanding General desires, as is the policy of his Government, to extend every facility to the peaceable and quiet citizens of every part of the county to support themselves, and these facilities, so far as it can be done without injury to the success of his troops in the field, will permit fish to be taken by seines and nets in the waters adjoining the Co. of Chowan on the East Side of the Chowan River and the Albemarle, so long as no Confederate or N. C. State troops shall come into that county, and provided further that no one citizen shall salt or cure more than ten barrels of fish for his own use, and there shall be no greater accumulation at any point within 7 miles of each other than 100 barrels of fish so cured, and at no point any such accumulation be made more than 1 mile from navigable waters of at least 4 feet draft. As this permission is given wholly in deference to the wishes of the citizens of Chowan County, and for their use and benefit, and without any possible good to the United States except in taking care of its citizens and with very possible harm if it is abused, the utmost good faith will be required of the citizens to carry out in the same spirit of fairness as it is permitted, -- this business of fishing, -- and any abuse of this privilege or infraction of its terms will be most severely dealt with as a breach of trust of confidence.
Seventh. The seventh and last question: ""We would farther represent to Major General Butler, in behalf of our fellow citizens, that during the progress of this dreadful conflict we have been exempted to a great extent from the presence of
troops in our midst, and as we conceive the locality to be devoid of military importance, we sincerely hope and trust that Maj. Gen. Butler may not order its occupation by any of the troops under his command,"" is answered in the answer to the first question and in the general spirit of the answers of this note.
The Commanding General desires to call the attention of the Committee and others of the citizens of the Co. to the fact that if their action is characterized with good faith and true desire to preserve the peace of the Co., there will be no possible difficulty, and trouble can only result from the acts of bad men who either from hostility to the United States, or from love of gain, will hazard the interests of their fellow citizens, and such men must be watched and restrained by the organized action of the citizens of the county, who have their own peace and quiet in their own hands. I have the honor to be,
Very respectfully, Yr. Obdt. Servt.,
B. F. Butler, Maj. Gen. Commanding"

My dear Sir: I have read the article in the Republican with pleasure.
I have been since June 1863 an advocate of the south side of the James route to Richmond. I have never yet been able to understand why, if supplies and men can be landed with greater facility than at Acquia Creek, without opposition on the James within 20 miles of Richmond, with a water carriage which allows them to be brought from New York without transshipment to a high, dry, cultivated land (as) that lying between me and Richmond, I therefore ought to land at Acquia
Creek and march over a land route intersected by five rivers -- 150 miles, -- necessitating a land carriage of supplies that distance for the purpose of getting within twenty miles of the swamp side of Richmond. Until I am instructed on this point by the forthcoming work on military science by the General-in-Chief of the Army, I shall remain unconvinced of the superior feasibility of the present route to Richmond.

Colonel Butler was already far advanced in a hopeless
consumption when he first came under my care, in September last, but I entertained some little hope from his great natural strength of constitution and from his temperate habits, that we might by diligent application of remedies procure a truce and save him for a year or two. As you know, the effort was a failure in all aspects.
The only service I have been able to render him, of any value, is of a moral kind; sympathy, earnest attention to his symptoms, and the consolation of friendship. He is worthy of the best hearts of earth and Heaven.

But when the brandy was taken it was claimed to be the property of Wm. E. Leverick, a resident of N. O., an enemy of the Govt. The present claimants were never heard of until after I left N. O., and I don't believe would be now if I were there in command.

General: I have the honor to forward to you with commendation the report of Brigadier-General Wistar of his brilliantly and ably executed movement upon Richmond, which failed only from one of those fortuitous circumstances against which no foresight can provide, and no execution can overcome.
By the corruption and faithlessness of a sentinel, who is now being tried for the offense, a man condemned to death but reprieved by the President was allowed to escape within the enemy's lines, and there gave them such information as enabled them to meet our advance. This fact is acknowledged in two of the Richmond papers, the Examiner and the Sentinel, published the day after the attack, and is fully confirmed by the testimony before the court-martial, before which is being tried the man who permitted the escape. I beg leave to call your attention to the suggestion of General Wistar in his report, that the effect of the raid will be to hereafter keep as many troops around Richmond for its defense from any future movement of the Army of the Potomac as we have in this neighborhood. I have the honor to be,

"February 9, 1864","From General I. J. Wistar
Yorktown, Feb. 9, 1864 Maj. R. S. Davis, Assistant Adjutant-General
Major: I have the honor to report the following operations of the forces under my command, undertaken with a
view to the surprise and capture of Richmond, and incidental results.
All the infantry and cavalry placed at my disposal by the General Commanding, being about four thousand of the former and two thousand two hundred of the latter, were suddenly concentrated behind my lines at Williamsburg after dark on the evening of the 5th instant, together with Hunt's and Belger's light batteries.
The infantry, consisting of three white regiments, brigaded under Col. R. M. West, First Pennsylvania Light Artillery, and three colored regiments under Colonel Duncan, Fourth U. S. Colored Troops, moved thence at -- A. M. on the 6th, carrying on the person six days' rations in the knapsack, and seventy rounds of cartridges, -- forty in the boxes and thirty in the knapsack.
The cavalry, being detachments of five regiments under Col. S. P. Spear, Eleventh Pennsylvania Cavalry, moved two hours later. Colonel Spear was directed to arrive at Bottom's Bridge, twelve miles this side of Richmond, by 3 A. M. of the 7th, surprise it, and move on rapidly to Richmond. A picked company under Captain Hill, First New York Mounted Rifles, with selected horses, was placed in advance to ride down the three pickets -- at New Kent, Baltimore Cross-Roads, and at the Bridge. Arrangements had been previously made to have the telegraph wire between Meadow Station and Richmond cut between dark and midnight of the 6th. By these means it was hoped to surprise the enemy's Battery No. 2, on the Bottom's Bridge road near Richmond, and occupy Capitol Square in that city for at least two or three hours; detachments previously detailed and carefully instructed breaking successively from the main column, on entering, for various specific purposes. Of course, the success of the enterprise was based upon the sudden and noiseless surprise of the strong picket at Bottom's Bridge, without which it would be impossible for cavalry alone to pass Battery No. 2. Colonel Spear reached Bottom's bridge, a distance of fifty-one miles, ten minutes before the time designated, but found the enemy there in strong force, with infantry, cavalry, and artillery. They received notice some sixteen hours previously, and had during that time been vigorously making preparations. The bridge planks had been taken up, the fords both above and below effectually obstructed, extensive earthworks and riflepits constructed, and a strong force of troops brought down
by the York River Railroad, by which large accessions were still arriving.
The darkness prevented an attack till morning, when a detachment of the New York Mounted Rifles, under Major Whelan, made a gallant but unsuccessful charge on the bridge by the only approach -- a long causeway flanked on either hand by an impassable marsh. The enemy opened with canister, first checking and then repulsing the charge, with a loss to us of nine killed and wounded and ten horses killed. All our men were subsequently brought off, as well as the saddles and equipments. The river was reconnoitred both above and below for some miles, but at every possible crossing the enemy was found in force with newly placed obstructions.
Our infantry had marched, on the 6th, thirty-three miles, arriving at New Kent Court-House at 2 A. M. on the 7th.
It is the obvious fact that a small force in this vicinity, actively handled, can and should hold a much superior force of the enemy in the immediate vicinity of Richmond inactive except for its defence. I have the honor to be, Major, with great respect,

P. S. Allow me to call your attention to an article in the Richmond Examiner sent herewith.
Enclosure referred to in Foregoing Letter
(From the Daily Examiner, Friday morning, February 12, 1864)
Some extremes of abasement there are to which our Government will not degrade this Confederacy. For example, we shall be slow to believe that it would ever ask an officer bearing a Confederate commission -- let us say Judge Ould -- to meet on terms of equality and to treat about exchange of prisoners with a negro colonel of a Massachusetts regiment. If President Lincoln should signify that he is ready to permit a new negotiation to be entered upon with a view to exchange, provided we send our commissioner to settle the terms with Frederick Douglass or with Colonel Pompey, on the part of the other belligerent, we presume that our Executive would decline. At any rate, our soldiers now in Northern prisons would feel bitterly humiliated by the thought of their freedom or captivity depending on such a negotiation. No; we do not believe that the Government of our country will ever bring us down to this.
But the Legislature of Virginia is not of our opinion. There is no depth of degradation, it is said, that they are not willing and eager to plunge us into in ""secret session."" No wonder it was in ""secret session"" that some person or persons, to us unknown, have moved and advocated, and carried through both houses of the Legislature, a resolution in the nature of
a petition to the President, requesting him to accept as Federal agent of exchange, not even the mulatto Frederick, or the wretched runaway slave Pompey, but a person whom the President has officially proclaimed ""a felon deserving of capital punishment,"" ""an outlaw or common enemy of mankind,"" ""a criminal who, wherever he shall be caught, is to be executed by hanging."" Such is the language of the proclamation of Mr. Davis, dated 23rd of December, 1862.
And still another odious calumny hovers over and darkens this bad affair. It is given out that the President has almost invited the strange action of the Virginia Legislature. We hope that this is incredible. Here is a wretch not only denounced as a felon by our own Government, but blasted by the unanimous execration of the whole world, and even by all decent persons of his own nation, and the enemy's Government, for that very reason, and with no other object than to bully us and humiliate us and compel us to eat dirt, demands that he and no other is the person we shall treat with in such a momentous affair. The Confederates themselves are to rehabilitate his character and be his vouchers and security as an honorable man. It is the most audacious and insolent attempt yet made to force us to acknowledge ourselves criminals and rebels, who have not even the rights of belligerents. And now we are to be told that the President has even signified his wish to be requested to belie himself and contradict himself and acknowledge that he had committed an act of empty presumption, in denouncing so illustrious a ""major-general"" as a felon and enemy of the human race!

Hon. E. M. Stanton, Secretary of War
Sir: On the Flag of Truce boat which came in on the 27th of January I received the enclosed proposition from Commissioner Ould, in relation to the attendance by their own surgeons
of the prisoners who were sick on either side. That communication was addressed to General Hitchcock, and of course. ignored my appointment in the matter of exchange. As there has never been any complaint on the part of the Confederate prisoners of war in our hands that they have not received proper surgical and hospital treatment, and as no pretence has been raised by the Confederate authorities to that effect, and as on our side we have received less complaint of the treatment by the rebels of our prisoners in hospitals than elsewhere, and so, as I have occasion to know the treatment in the hospitals by the rebels of our soldiers; prisoners in their hands having been reasonably proper and sufficient, I was induced to look with some care for the motive which should require at this time, this proposition from Commissioner Ould.
Acting under what I believe to be your instructions, whatever proposition looking to more than the ordinary routine of matters carried on by Flag of Truce would not have been received or acted upon. Of course, therefore, I did not forward it; but supposed that it had been properly addressed. It seemed to me that it was a proposition intended to put us in the condition of admitting that our treatment of their prisoners was similar, and required like remedies to meet the case as their own, or, in other words, that we were to admit to the world that there was a necessity for them to send their surgeons to take care of their sick soldiers in our hands, an admission I would be very slow to make.
The second part of the proposition, that these surgeons might act as Commissaries in delivering food, money, clothing, and medicines forwarded for the relief of the prisoners, not being accompanied by any offer to retract the order of rejection of all supplies furnished either by corporate bodies, Sanitary Commission, States, or the Government, and as Commissioner Ould has over and over again assured the Assistant Agent of Exchange that all private relief was duly forwarded for distribution, and as our own men and officers are now acting as Commissaries of distribution in the rebel camps for such supplies as are in fact forwarded, there was another motive for this paper than that which appears upon its face.
Again, this paper came to me at the same time with the information that the Virginia Legislature were discussing, and about passing, and as I am now informed, have passed, a Resolution requesting the Confederate authorities to recognize the Agent of Exchange appointed by the Government,
and knowing as I do that this action was taken by the Virginia Legislature because of the pressure brought to bear upon them from the supposed ill-treatment which their prisoners would receive and were receiving at my hands, and taking also in connection with the fact that to relieve that pressure every newspaper in the Confederacy was publishing reports of how well the Confederate prisoners in our hands were treated, it seemed quite certain that this proposition was made:
First. For the purpose of having this Government weaken its position in regard to sustaining the present Agent of Exchange by adopting what on the first blush appeared to be a humane measure sent through other channels than through me, precisely as the Confederate authorities weakened their own position by refusing to negotiate with me, by having treated with me in regard to vaccine matter, while they repudiate me as an Agent of Exchange.
Secondly. For the purpose of getting an acknowledgment of the country and for use abroad, that because of my neglect of their soldiers in our hands there was some need that their own surgeons should be sent to them.
Thirdly. To be able to answer the pressure which is now bearing upon them to have the exchange go on, by suggesting to their frightened brothers, sisters, fathers, and mothers, that the sick in our hands would now have the treatment of their own Confederate surgeons, and thereby relieve the Confederate Government from the pressure to have the Exchange go on, and to recede from the position taken by them.
Some further action should be had by Commissioner Ould on behalf of this Government in regard to the exchange, that this proposition shall not be even considered, because I know that its consideration will weaken the position of the Government, and that if we can hold to the position taken by us, which is justified by the prisoners themselves in Richmond, and which justified itself to the world, that the infallible result will be that we shall get such terms as are honorable to us in this matter of exchange, as against the Confederates.
If no action is based upon newspaper reports, and if newspaper men can be kept from interfering with the exchange for purpose of their own self-glorification, I believe that within the week I shall have personal conference with the Confederate Commissioner upon all these subjects, and arrange most of them satisfactorily, provided nothing is done which shall
weaken the belief that unless exchange is effected the sternest and severest retaliation will be marked out. For I have no doubt that if that measure of retaliation which I suggested was now being carried out, instead of the first three hundred and fifty prisoners having just arrived at Point Lookout after months delay, that the exchange would go forward in such manner as to give us every soldier, black and white, that they have in their hands.
Upon the proposition as to surgeons, however, I will confer with Commissioner Ould, and report further, and in the mean-time, I beg that no further action will be had by the Government.
I wish further to add that I understand that Mr. Fulton's statement in regard to his communication with Commissioner Ould must be taken with some grains of allowance. I have the honor to be

"February 16, 1864","From John Wilson to General Butler
Confidential. Chicago, Feby. 10th, 1864
General: I pray you, excuse me, a stranger, in thus addressing you; my motive is my apology.
As preliminary, permit me to state that more than two
years ago I addressed a letter to a young friend in Orleans, suggesting that the admirable manner in which you managed affairs in Louisiana was conclusive that you were the man specially fitted to guide the Ship of State, after Mr. Lincoln's term closed; and all subsequent experience has deepened that conviction. The next five years will be the most important era in the history of our country. To reorganize the Govt., effectually crush out this infamous rebellion, root and branch, the pacification of discordant and conflicting elements consequent upon it, will require consummate wisdom, pure patriotism, and unyielding firmness; in fact, all the elements that were found necessary to the formation of it at the close of our Revolutionary struggle, and perhaps in a higher degree.
It is very apparent that Mr. Lincoln has not these elements, and that his rule will have been played out at the end of his present term, and therefore his re-election would be prejudicial to the best interests of our country, if not destructive to its liberty.
With many of my fellow-citizens, and without prejudice to other prominent statesmen, I believe you have the necessary qualifications to guide the National affairs in any crisis, and therefore desire you as our Standard Bearer, in the approaching Presidential Campaign. The preferences of some gentlemen are for other distinguished men, and we have agreed to strive harmoniously for our respective candidate, leaving the determination of ""the man"" to a National Convention, if such a body can be obtained, uninfluenced by Executive obligations or dictations. Of course my hope is, and efforts are, and will be, that you will be the candidate.
These remarks are merely prefatory to the real object and intent of this letter.
You have seen the movements of the Germans in New Jersey in your favor, and very little effort, I believe, will induce perfect union and concert of action among them, throughout the country; and this, of course, will have a powerful influence, if not a conclusive effect on the nomination and election.
Genl. Siegel is the idol of his countrymen; and his banishment has embittered vast masses of them against Mr. Lincoln. Those of them who are friendly to Mr. L's re-election find this a serious objection, and will leave no measure untried to have him placed in active service. Thus far, every effort made to that end has proved unsuccessful; and I believe that it is a foregone conclusion, by the existing powers, that he shall
remain in retiracy. A movement, however, by you, to effect this object, will bind the Germans to you by adamantine chains; and if it be perfectly proper on your part, and the best interests of our country will be secured, -- or will not be prejudiced thereby, -- I earnestly request that in the most public manner possible you ask the proper authorities to detail Genl. Siegel for active service, under your command, in your Department.
If there is anything improper in this request, anything in any manner discourteous, I apologize most fully for it, and assure you such is not my intention. My only object is, at present, to secure to our country the services of a brave and accomplished officer, who is certainly competent to do more than organize the gallant yeomanry of Pennsylvania; and, if possible, through this means, in the future, to elevate to the Presidency one who will be an honor to his country.
Please acknowledge the receipt of this letter; and if you apply for Siegel's transfer to your Department, advise me of it by telegraph, that it may at once be published. If you apply, simply please say ""Your request complied with,"" giving the date. If the application is refused, say ""Request complied with, -- refused,"" or ""granted,"" -- as the case may be. My residence is No. 5, Park Row, Chicago, -- my post-office box No. 3858.

Hon. E. M. Stanton, Secretary of War
Sir: Upon the matter of the Declaration of Exchange of prisoners, I have the honor to report that following what I believed to be the ordinary routine of the business of exchange, and in order that the equivalent of our men might be put into the field to meet those received from us by the Confederates, I made the Declaration of Exchange. It is in ""ipsissimis verbis"" so far as applicable, with the other Declarations of Exchange heretofore made, copies of some of which I here-unto annex in proof of this assertion. This Declaration, it will be observed, only affects those men actually delivered at City Point.
The Confederate Commissioner, acting as I believe under the exact provisions of the cartel, has declared exchanged those who have been delivered to him up to the first of January, as will appear by the paper hereto annexed.
I could, and can see no reason why we should not declare those so delivered, exchanged. I am unable to see any hidden secret or malign influence that it can have upon any pending question. I am unable to find a single good reason against it. I find it exceedingly difficult to argue a question where there seems to be but one side. When in my former note to the Honorable Secretary of War I spoke of seven hundred and fifty men, I spoke of the number of individuals and not of the number reduced to privates, and the letter of Maj. Gen. Hitchcock, which would seem to contravene that number, is not too ingenuous. The objection made in that letter that ""the Declaration would have admitted defence if you had extended it to a number precisely corresponding to the number delivered by yourself, according to the 5th article of the cartel,
supposing that instrument operative,"" is exactly met by the case in hand, because since the last Declaration of Exchange only Special Exchanges have been made by delivery at City Point, of man for man, equivalent for equivalent, so that when the Declaration of Exchange states that all who have been delivered at City Point up to a given time, since the last Declaration of Exchange, it is saying the precise number which have been exchanged.
To the statement in the letter of General Hitchcock, that ""the Declaration should have set out the grounds of it."" I answer the universal practice of the office has been not to do so, and this would seem to be a hyper criticism on his part, because I made the Declaration, and not himself, as it is made precisely as he makes such declarations.
Again, it is said that ""a proper list should have been furnished of those declared to be exchanged, for announcement from the Adjt. Genl.'s Office for the information of all concerned, and Mr. Ould should have been furnished a list of those delivered to him."" To that, I answer that such lists have not been announced heretofore, and such has not been the practice (See Gen. Orders No. 134, Series 1862, and Nos. 10, 117 and 167, Series 1863). And as to the delivery of a list to Mr. Ould, I answer that it has been done, and no man has been delivered to him without a list, and he knows who has been delivered to him without any telling him a second time, and he makes no objection on that account.
As to making the ""announcement by a list, for the information of all concerned,"" if that means the officers and men who would be returned to duty because of the Declaration of Exchange, each one of those will be likely to remember what time he escaped from Libby Prison, and Belle Isle, and each one of those will know whether he was delivered at City Point, and when. Therefore the announcement of the day, prior to which all who have been delivered were exchanged, is sufficient.
I pray the Secretary to examine, as covering this whole matter, my Declaration of Exchange, and the copies of the General Orders heretofore annexed. I have the honor to be,

Sir: I had the honor to inform you yesterday of the seizure of the schooner ""Ann Hamilton,"" at Point Lookout -- that vessel being then on the way from Baltimore to the Great Wicomisco, under a permit from General Butler, for purposes of traffic.
Genl. Butler has, it seems, given similar permits for similar
purposes of trade in other parts of the insurrectionary region under blockade and unopened by Proclamation. One of these was given to the steamer ""Princeton"" on the 11th inst., to proceed through the canals and the waters of Albemarle Sound and Chowan and Roanoke rivers, for the purpose of getting in exchange for family supplies the products of the adjacent country. I herewith enclose a copy of the permit, in which it is stated it is given in accordance with certain additional Regulations for Commerical Intercourse with and in States declared in insurrection.
Acting Rear Admiral Lee very properly declined to pass the steamer through the blockade lines, or at least suspended action until the Navy Department could be communicated with. I approved his course in the matter, and instructed him that vessels could not pass beyond the lines of blockade for traffic, or to interchange commodities, as the additional Regulations referred to were not understood to authorize permits to be given for that purpose.
The rules of blockade cannot be set aside or disregarded in the desire to promote trade and intercourse. We cannot extend privileges to our own citizens to traffic within the lines of blockade, and deny them to citizens of other countries.
The ""Princeton"" seems to be a similar case to that of the ""Ann Hamilton,"" excepting that there appears to have been a disposition to abuse by the latter vessel, the privilege proposed to be extended to the owners, by carrying cargo not enumerated in the manifest, also upwards of $15,000, in Southern funds.

from the War Department. If the Sec'y will do me the favor to read the report to Mr. Dana, a copy of which with the papers is annexed, he will observe that every safeguard possible was thrown around the permit, that a bond of $20,000 was taken that nothing should be done that could by any possibility injure the United States, and that the cargo was limited to those things which could not benefit the armies of the Confederate States, and that no money was found on board except Southern money, the keeping of which in circulation in Northern States I have yet to learn is not a benefit to the Confederate States. Indeed, if I could I would send every dollar of it, Confederate and Bank note, into the Confederate States without any return. Much more if I could get corn and pork for it. In my report to the Asst. Secy. I have asked for directions as to the policy to be pursued hereafter, and I need not say that it has only to be indicated to be strictly followed. But it is to be remarked that unless either family supplies or Southern money is sent into the Confederate States, it will be impossible to get cotton or any other product out of the Confederate States within the meaning of the Treasury Regulations Sec. 51-54. That to get such products out is desirable seems to be determined by the Treasury Regulations, and if it were not, the law just passed by the Confederate Congress prohibiting all exporting of cotton, tobacco, turpentine, and other products, under the severest penalties, would show that they regard such exporting as injurious in the highest degree, and that they mean to hold these products as a basis for their currency, and as a means of supplying munitions of war, and not have them dissipated in supplying the needs of their citizens. The last clause of Gen. Canby's letter is ""that complaints have reached this Dept. of other vessels under permits granted by you which have been engaged in contraband trade."" I desire to answer that I have given but a single other permit to any vessel, and that to the steam propeller ""Princeton,"" which now lies in Norfolk harbor awaiting the action of the Sec'y of the Navy and Treasury upon the question whether she shall sail; so that no vessel under my permit, except the ""Hamilton"" whose case I have just discussed, and the ""Princeton"" which never has left Norfolk or sold a dollar's worth of goods, have received any permit from me. That complaints will be made is most true, and I have only to request the Dept. that when any such complaints are made they will be forwarded for a report, with the assurance that all action
can be justified in intention however erroneous it may be in judgment.

Hd. Qrs. Dept. of Va. and N. C., Fort Monroe, Feb. 19th, 1864
Hon. G. V. Fox, Asst. Secretary of the Navy
Sir: I have had the honor to make a report to the Assistant Secretary of War, C. A. Dana, which I duplicate for your information, in relation to the schooner ""Ann Hamilton"" and her permit to trade in the Counties of Lancaster and Northumberland and the Little Wicomisco River. A brief history of the transaction is this. A gentleman of undoubted loyalty and of high character for probity stated to me that there was a quantity of corn and other products of the country in the Counties of Northumberland and Lancaster between the Potomac River and the Rappahannock and near the first, that some of it was already the property of loyal men, who had been driven from there. Others the property of peaceable citizens there; that there was considerable distress in that part of Virginia for want of ordinary family supplies, that it was substantially neutral ground, although at that time it might be considered within our lines, but not occupied by either party permanently, save as raids were made into it, and such things carried off [as] were supposed to benefit the raiders on either side; that as the Rebels were depending upon this portion of Virginia for supplies, it might benefit the Government to have the provisions which would supply their army taken away, even by substituting such things as could not facilitate Army supplies.
He presented me satisfactory permits for this purpose and endorsements from the Treasury Department. Yielding to the views thus expressed, and believing it would be best to get out such provisions in every way, and determined to ascertain if that Peninsula was occupied by the enemy, I sent an expedition there under the command of General Marston, who destroyed or brought away all the stores that seemed to belong to the Government. But that expedition found no force there, and of course allowed a large amount of provisions to remain in the hands of private citizens. I then granted the permit, a copy of which is hereto annexed, to Mr. Hopkins, permitting him to take not exceeding ten thousand dollars' worth of such goods as might be of use to families, and could
be of no substantial benefit to an Army, upon his giving bonds in the sum of twenty thousand dollars, that not more than fifty dollars worth of those should be sold to any one person within any thirty days, so that this should be a mere matter of family supply, and that he might bring out corn and other products of the country, paying for them with Southern money only, supposing that the more the Rebels had of that currency, the worse they would be off. I guarded the permits, as you will see, in every way possible. I made it for the interest of all parties that the business should be properly conducted. Whether this transaction would have any effect upon the blockade did not escape my attention, but supposed and still suppose [the blockade] could and would apply only to such parts as would, could, or should be or ever had been entered by foreign vessel, and I felt quite clear in my mind that Little Wicomisco River and the branches of those counties were not such ports of foreign entry. I supposed the Potomac Flotilla was only to prevent the smuggling of goods into the Confederacy to aid them, and not with any reference to a foreign blockade, indeed that portion of the Potomac River [is not] within the President's Proclamation of Blockade as I understand it.
I believe Mr. Hopkins employed one Miles as his Agent to go there, because of his knowledge of that country, and, I suppose, independently of the question of his supposed loyalty. A very proper selection if he knew the country well, and was not supposed to be too loyal, because I doubt if either you or I went there to trade, and announced ourselves, we should meet with the greatest courtesy or highest success. Indeed, if I had occasion to make a negotiation in the infernal regions, I should not employ a saint as an ambassador. But I believed and still believe that it was so for Hopkins' and Miles' interest not to defraud the Government, that they were so far hedged in by bonds and penalty, and that it was so much to their interest to behave well, that there was no danger that the Government would come to harm in the transaction, but rather would be benefitted, and the Rebels injured. The matter was being carried out in the utmost good faith, as I believe, when a certain Stephen B. Taylor of Baltimore, who knew nothing of the safeguards or checks thrown around the transaction or its purposes or objects, put a publication in the newspapers, concerning it, being urged thereto, as I am informed and believe by personal hostility to Hopkins, to whom he is a large debtor, and takes this manner of cancelling his obligations. Thereupon
one McPhail, who I believe signs himself as Provost Marshal of Maryland, made certain allegations against Miles, all of which may or may not be true. They do not affect the transaction, as Miles is but the Agent, and since objection has been made to him, all parties interested have offered to withdraw him now, upon the vessel going to the mouth of the Wicomisco. Having due clearance from Baltimore, she was seized by Commodore Parker and sent up to Washington for confiscation. If anything can be found on her not on her mainfes any evidence of ill-faith or wrong intentions or acts other than is stated in the permit. I should be very glad that she would be confiscated, and would have every party connected with her punished. But if nothing can be found except what is in her permit, in good faith and according to the enterprize she is on, I think it quite unjust that she should be detained and her owners put to expense. In such case it is certain that the vessel should be discharged and turned over again to her owners. Whether the enterprize shall be permitted to go on depends upon what is the policy of the Government in this behalf.
Upon this subject I desire specific instructions. If the Government desires the Rebels to retain all their resources, I will carry out that policy. If it is desired that according to my best judgment their resources should be got away from them, I will try and do that. But if every meddling puppy who chooses to write newspaper articles is allowed to interfere with my acts in my Department, I can do nothing. I find that New Treasury Regulations from 51 to 54 have just been published, in which it is claimed that it is desirable that all the products and stores in the Rebel States which can be got out into the loyal States under certain restrictions shall be, and various provisions are therein made for such action, and Commanders of Military Departments are requested to aid the Treasury owners of such property in that behalf. I have tried so to do. Is that desirable? Are the means, modes, and methods of this to be put to my discretion? Are the Agents that I employ to be subject not to any scrutiny of their acts, for that is expected, but to the interference of those without authority. I wish to profess the most thorough willingness to take any course with these matters that is desired, only, when a course is taken, I desire to be let alone. There is another question to which I wish to call attention, and that is whether the blockade applies, so far as foreign Governments are concerned, to the inland
waters of Albermarle, Pamlico, Croaten, Roanoke, and Cumtuck Sounds, to the river running into them, no foreign trade ever having been carried on within these Sounds; or whether they are to be considered as inland waters to be guarded for revenue purposes, and to prevent smuggling to the enemy, but not in reference to the international rights arising out of the blockade. It is difficult for me to see what right any foreign nation has to interfere with the trade which might spring up between the loyal inhabitants on Roanoke Island and the loyal inhabitants in Tyrell County, North Carolina, or how any international questions of a blockade can arise because of that trade. I have further to say that I shall allow no more permits for any body to do anything in the way of trade outside of my picket lines without they bring me an order from the Secretary of War, the Secretary of the Navy, and the Secretary of the Treasury, so that I may be certain that all three of these Departments have agreed as touching that thing, and that neither will interfere to stop the enterprize before it is concluded.

Dear Sir: Can there be any doubt that in an exclusively military district, where there is no pretence of any civil authority within a garrison, that cases of civil rights necessarily arising must be heard and determined by the Commanding General, acting usually of course through his Staff Officers, who hold Provost Court? I wish you would give me your opinion upon this subject, as it seems I ought not to sit quietly by and see one man in Fort Monroe swindle another out of large amounts of money without in some way interfering, because the wrong is done by device instead of force.

Headquarters, Dept. Va. and N. C., Fort Monroe, Feb. 20th, 1864
Col. W. Hoffman, Commissary General of Prisoners
Colonel: Your letter of the 15th inst., in regard to furnishing boxes of eatables and clothing to prisoners is received. In the course of the negotiations for the supplying of comforts to our prisoners this state of facts has obtained.
First. That the Rebel Authorities receive all provisions from whatever source sent to the prisoners. Then, because of accusations of the late Commr. of Exchange, Gen. Meredith published in the newspapers that these provisions were embezzled for sustenance for Gen. Lee's Army, they refused to receive any boxes, either from our Government or from State Governments.
Then, because the Sanitary Commission and various benevolent individuals indulged their patriotism by labelling their boxes, ""To our starving Soldiers in Richmond,"" ""To our brave defenders in Libby Prison,"" the Rebel Authorities refused to receive all boxes sent to our prisoners. At my intercession, however, Mr. Ould, the Confederate Commissioner, then agreed to receive boxes from private sources, i. e., from the friends and families of our prisoners. But after the five hundred prisoners were exchanged from Point Lookout, and reported that by your order boxes of provisions and clothing were not delivered to Confederate Prisoners there, Mr. Ould refused, owing to a cry arising in the newspapers at Richmond, that he was furnishing our prisoners with their boxes, while the Confederate prisoners were deprived of their boxes, to permit any boxes to be sent to our men under his charge, unless I would assure him that the Confederate prisoners under my charge received their boxes. As I had long since been taught the rule, ""Do as you would be done by,"" this seemed to me eminently just, and I therefore gave an Order to General Marston that the boxes containing nothing contraband or hurtful, sent from private sources, might be delivered to the prisoners, and informed Mr. Ould by the last Flag of Truce boat of that fact, and received his assurance, through the Asst. Agent of Exchange, that the boxes sent by the friends of our prisoners should be delivered to them.
I agree fully that the delivery of packages to prisoners causes the commander of camps a great deal of trouble. The question certainly gives me a great deal of trouble, but I undergo that
trouble cheerfully, and would if it were twice as much, in order that our prisoners may get even smaller alleviations for their sufferings than those which they receive from their friends.
I have conversed with many of our prisoners on this subject, and they say that many of the boxes received from their friends have been almost a source of support to them, and they were complaining loudly of the Confederate Government because that source of supply had of late been substantially cut off.
The last number of prisoners that escaped left on Monday, and the assurance that Mr. Ould sent me was given on the same day, and they had not heard of the resumption of the delivery of packages; but they have no doubt it has been resumed. I agree with you fully that the Rebel prisoners in our hands are abundantly fed, but I suppose that when you and I were at school we were abundantly fed, and our stewards at that time hardly thought it an imputation upon their feeding because we received boxes of sweetmeats and cakes from home. Pardon me, but I look upon this matter, so far as the Rebel Prisoners are concerned, pretty much in the same light. But with our soldiers in their hands, it is a matter, as I am instructed, of almost entire subsistence.
In the meantime, therefore, I desire to have, and shall have the delivery of packages made in accordance with the views herein contained, unless specially directed to the contrary by the Secretary of War, for I cannot ask the Confederate Commissioners to deliver boxes to prisoners from their friends while I refuse to deliver the boxes from their friends to their prisoners. Whenever the time comes for our Government to retaliate upon these men for the wrongs done to our prisoners, I assure you it shall be done in a much more explicit and telling manner than by withholding boxes and provisions from their prisoners sent them by their friends. In the meantime, I do not permit anything to come from the Confederate Government, or from State Governments of the Confederacy, for the support of their prisoners, for that would be an implicit admission that we were not supporting them sufficiently.
And, therefore, when Governor Vance, of North Carolina, forwarded through Commissioner Ould a draft for nine thousand dollars, in favor of the Governor of New York, to be by the Governor of New York expended for the benefit of North Carolina prisoners in our hands, I obtained such draft, and still do retain it, and have notified Mr. Ould, unofficially, and shall
hereafter inform him officially if such relations ever exist between us, that the United States does not select the Governor of any State to take care of its prisoners of war, or allow anyone else to so select any one of them, however much they may respect such officers, in their appropriate sphere, and that if Governor Vance, or the Governor of any other State, desires to have money expended for the benefit of prisoners, that if the same privilege is given ours we shall have no objection to such expenditure, provided it is done through the Agents of the United States Government, and not through any correspondence between the Governors of States.
I would also call your attention to what I think will be necessary to be done further in this direction, to wit: that the Confederate prisoners be allowed to purchase such things as they may desire to wear, eat, or drink, intoxicating liquors alone excepted, with their own money or that furnished them by their friends. And I would like to have your views upon this subject.
I also desire to ask your attention to these views, because if they influence your judgment as they have mine, I trust we shall make a uniform order to all the prisoners held by me, that they shall be allowed to receive boxes from their friends, and buy with their own money a reasonable amount of things which they may need. Awaiting an interchange of views, I am,

Hon. G. V. Fox, Assistant Sec. of the Navy
I suppose it would be etiquette for me to address the Secretary of War, and thence have him address you upon the subject of this communication, and did I not know that you have the good of the service at heart, and would see the matter the same as myself, I should do so. I sent the steamer ""Express,"" an armed Government transport under charge of Capt. Clapp, a very judicious officer, whom I propose to make a Field Officer, to recruit for my Colored Regiments. He landed at Piney Point, where his steamer was seized and detained for some days until the negroes could all be hidden by the acting master of the steamer ""Sophronia,"" one of the Potomac Flotilla and his recruiting officers, insulted by a Mr. Massett, one of the officers
of the ""Sophronia"" and also by one Provost who was an acting master in the ""Anacosta."" This last man attempted to discourage enlistments, and the ""Express"" was delayed until a large portion of the object of the expedition was frustrated, and from the conduct of the officers the object is apparent. I do not understand why the officers of the Navy should be allowed, upon any pretense whatever, and especially inferior officers of the Navy, for none of the superior officers do it, to interfere with the United States transport commanded by a United States Army officer, the superior of the officer interfering. Were it not that I have endeavored to cultivate, with every officer of the Navy, the same kindly relations that I should hold towards yourself, and perhaps partly because of those relations, I should be inclined to try strength between one of my armed transports and these Commanders, and let the responsibility come where it would.
I pray you examine carefully these reports, and then have these officers disciplined.
The recruits that I was endeavoring to get were for the Colored Cavalry, whose efficiency and usefulness you yourself saw.
I shall not trouble you with those citizens of St. Mary's County that interfered with my recruiting officer. I will give them a lesson which shall be quite sufficient, but while I punish the citizens, I pray you to see to it the Navy officers who encouraged them to interfere shall be also punished, and I wish further that you would give orders to the Naval Commanders never to interfere with any Army boat that has one of my commissioned officers aboard of it. I am responsible for him and his acts, and I cannot allow any inferior officer to judge over my head, and allow my expeditions wherever they may be sent to be interfered with by Naval officers. It is these interferences of petty officers, without sense and a little authority, which created the animosity which I have found existing between the Army and Navy in this Department, and which I have endeavored to correct, and in doing which, I desire your aid.
Between myself and Admiral Lee those difficulties cannot exist. He knows his rights and duties and I know mine, and we have no trouble; but it is the under officers, particularly of the Potomac Flotilla, that need discipline. They have lain dormant so long in the River near the Maryland shore that they have caught the tone of the Maryland Secessionist, if
they were ever loyal, which these specimens were not. I should be very glad to be informed what course has been pursued towards these officers of whom I complain. I have the honor to be,

D. E. Clapp, Captain and Recruiting Officer
Sir: I have the honor to report that on Monday, Feb. 15th, 1864, I came on board the U. States steamer ""Express,"" then lying at the wharf at Piney Point, St. Mary's County, Maryland, with a number of colored recruits. There were then on board several citizens for the purpose of getting certificates for the colored men, and while I was in conversation with them several Naval officers came on board, and one of them, Mr. Massett, Master's Mate on board the U. S. Schooner ""Sophronia,"" of the Potomac Flotilla, turned to a colored man standing near and asked him if he had enlisted (or was going to be a soldier). He said, ""Yes, sir."" He then asked him about these others, calling them by name, to know if they were going also. I did not hear the answer. He, Massett, then said, ""What in hell did you leave your master for, as good a one as you had? If I was in battle I would like to have all four of you in a row for breastwork. You are not worth a damn for soldiers, but would make a good breastwork to stop bullets. My advice for you is to go back, as you have a firstrate master. What do you say?"" The colored man replied, ""No, sir, I guess not.""
He, Massett, then said, ""If I were in your master's place, if any of you ever came back I would shoot you."" He also made remarks unbecoming an officer or a gentleman in reference to those engaged in recruiting, and used other insulting language towards the colored recruits as he passed off the steamer. I am, Captain,

Of course, if you desire to sink the light boats for obstructions in the river, sink them, because I do (not) mean to cripple you or to interfere with your judgment as to means of defense; but I believe Plymouth is as safe as Fortress Monroe, provided you keep from being surprised. I don't believe in the ironclad arrangement, and if you cannot deal with her from the point we visited together with your 200-pounder Parrott I shall be very much surprised. I do not think your danger, if any, lies there. The possibility of capture lies in this, or at least this is the way I should undertake to capture Plymouth if I had that iron-clad and was at Halifax: I should get plenty of barges and launches and come floating silently down in the night, land just above your obstructions, and seize your fort, with the 200-pounder Parrott, before your sleepy sentinel woke up, and then bring down my iron-clad, keeping your navy below by means of your fort and Parrott.
At Halifax, the rebels are preparing a sort of naval flotilla of barges, and I (have) no doubt for this purpose. ""Fore-warned, fore-armed.""

Framingham, Feb. 21st, 1864
My dear Sir: I owe you an apology for the abrupt manner in which I took my departure from your military family. Compelled to return from the South by way of New York, I was intending to return to Fortress Monroe, and explain to you why I could not remain, but your own arrival in New York, and the state of my health, determined me to return home, as I did not at that time wish to intrude upon you. My declination was based upon reasons purely domestic, but which could not be overcome. For your kindness in extending me the invitation, and while with you at Fortress Monroe, I shall ever be profoundly grateful. I did not find affairs in Gen. Gilmore's Department as prosperous as I had anticipated. The siege of Charleston will be productive of no useful results, while one and fifty millions of dollars and many lives have been expended, a costly mode of enforcing a blockade. The quarrels between him and his officers are interminable, and may continue, for aught I see, until every volunteer officer is driven out of his department.
Brigadier General Gordon would, I think, be very glad to exchange his position there to a command in your department. I believe him to be a most faithful and efficient officer.
The community here are much annoyed as you were chagrined at the failure of the Richmond expedition. It is conceded to have been the best timed and planned of any expedition yet started, and as it seems to have failed, everyone is disappointed. The remark continually made is, if that had succeeded, Butler would have been the next President, and nothing could have prevented. I hope at no distant day to have the whole history of the expedition, private and public.
I have forwarded by Adams Express the papers concerning the Tarboro raid. I visited the camp of the 3rd New York Cavalry, but could find no evidence that was not already taken by the Special Commissioners in the affidavits furnished me. Colonel Mix was absent on sick leave. The affidavits are very wide apart in their statements of facts, much of the statement is hearsay, and I do not believe the public service would be promoted by a trial before a Court Martial, or Military Commission.
I have not made a formal report, as I did not know that
under the circumstances it would be proper. If you desire it, and will return the papers, I will do so.
If I can be of any use to you whether here or at Washington in any matter, please command me at any time. With the kindest regards for yourself, Mrs. Butler, and family, I remain

"February 22, 1864","From Joseph A. Buck to General Butler
Norfolk, February 22nd, 1864
Dear Sir: I wish to make a statement of facts. For several years I have been more or less concerned with Mr. P. H. White-hurst, and on the breaking out of the rebellion we had considerable unsettled business, but were always friends, as a proof of which I will relate a circumstance to show how we both stood. At that time he had a contract with the Government in the name of Mr. R. P. Lovell, his son-in-law, for dried apples, in which I had no interest. The Navy Department sent an order for a lot to be delivered at the Brooklyn Navy Yard, New York. He could not ship them from Norfolk to New York, because the Rebels would not allow anything to be shipped there -- he shipped the apples to me in Baltimore to be forwarded to New York.
I shipped them on a schooner, and before the vessel sailed General Trimble's celebrated order came out -- and some one told him I was shipping apples to New York. He sent a guard and arrested me, and told me if the apples were sent he would hang me to the first lamp-post, though he did not know the apples were for the Government. The vessel did not sail until you arrived at Baltimore. Though I had no interest in the apples, I paid the freight and expenses to New York, and waited until I could see Mr. Whitehurst for the settlement of same. As soon as this place was evacuated, or nearly so, say on the 20 May, 1862, I shipped to Mr. Whitehurst some goods, and ever since that time have been interested with him in business in Norfolk, sometimes myself in Norfolk, and sometimes in Baltimore. On my last visit, I left Baltimore on the 2nd of January, 1864, to go to the sea beach to attend the wreck sale of the schooner ""E. C. Knight,"" for the purpose of purchasing the lumber and bring same to Norfolk, but the Government sent an Agent to the sale who bought it. Some days after the sale I called on the Quartermaster (Capt. Goodwin) to try to charter two vessels we had then in
Norfolk, that were suitable for the purpose, when the Quarter-master told me he wished to contract with some party to get the lumber to Norfolk or at least to the water on this side of the beach, and asked me if I knew Capt. S. A. Caffee (I told him I had seen him), and said he had been told he was the best man he could get. He asked me how he could get word to him. I told him he was in town, as I had just seen him. He requested me to go and tell Caffee that he wished to see him. I went and saw Capt. Caffee, and went with him to the Quartermaster, who made an arrangement with him to have the lumber hauled over the beach, and to furnish a pilot for the barges; after which I applied to the Quartermaster for the privilege to take on each vessel 100 sacks of salt, 10 bbls. flour, 5 bbls. molasses, 2 barrels sugar, 2 bags coffee and 1 box tobacco. This application was on the 13th January. The Quartermaster referred the application to the Provost Marshal, whose clerk endorsed it, oath taken and license obtained, the Provo signed it, and handed it to the clerk, who handed it to me. I asked him who I should take it to, so as to take the goods down and sell them, he said that was all, that every officer in the Department would respect it, that all I had to do was to get down as soon as I could and sell the goods, get the lumber and come back, this being repeated in hearing of the Provost Marshal. I went and loaded the vessel as per application and started. When the vessels arrived at the Rail Road Bridge, the guard took the papers and told them to proceed to the Locks, where if it was all right, the Captains would receive the papers again. It being a calm time the vessels did not reach the Locks that evening, and the tide being contrary, they both anchored where during the night they were taken possession of by a guard ordered by Provost Marshal and brought to Norfolk, where they arrived about the 20th January and were detained, waiting trial until the 30th, making seventeen days at the expense of twenty dollars per day for the two vessels lost to us, when Judge Stackpole gave a verdict releasing vessels and goods. I left to show the clerk where the vessels were to remove the guard, but before I got to them I was met by a clerk who handed me an order to appear at the Provost Marshal's office forthwith. I immediately went and waited near two hours, when the Lieut. came -- the Colonel ordered him to send the case immediately to the Provost Court, where I and several witnesses appeared from time to time on the charge of having in my possession goods that were suspected of being
Government property. Having shown the bills and the lots of each party who were suspected, and having the parties themselves in Court several times, and urging the Judge to give us a hearing, he sent a note to General Wild saying that there was no criminality resting on me, as I had purchased the goods without seeing these articles and had shown the parties of whom I had bought them.
Yet on the 18th of February General Wild hands back to me, or rather instructs his clerk to do so, all our applications to ship from Norfolk, and on the 20 Judge Stackpole held Court and the parties all appeared that had sold the goods to me that was suspected of being Government Goods, and all showed satisfactorily, save one, where or how they came by the goods. He says he thinks he could have found the party if he had had notice at the time, but as it has been a month, he does not know that he can find who his man bought it of. After this I asked the Judge if that cleared me. He said it did, and that he had given me a certificate to that effect some days since. I then made inquiry of a friend what was the reason I could not get a permit, who told me that there was a cloud hanging over me. I immediately addressed a note to General Wild, saying that as our applications had been returned disapproved, and I had been informed that there was a cloud over me, and as I was conscious that I could prove as good a character for loyalty, honesty and truth as any man in the Department, Civil or Military, would he in justice inform me what was necessary to remove the cloud, at his earliest convenience. Up to this time I have not received any answer.
I respectfully refer the above to your favorable consideration and beg to be placed on equal footing with others.

Respectfully returned -- with reference to Page 2, line 11. These goods were ostensibly sent for the use only of a gang of workmen and their families!! engaged on the ocean shore, where there ought to be salt enough for their limited purposes. In effect, they were to go beyond our lines, to a neighborhood noted for disloyalty of the worst form (guerillas); between which point and Richmond there would be no obstacle to the transportation of every pound. And these invoices would pay richly for the trouble. Also with a reference to Page 2, line 3 et seq. Buck knew well enough the character of Caffee, a guerilla himself, and brother, brother-in-law, uncle, and cousin, to several other guerillas. Buck could easily surmise what sort of a gang of workmen Caffee would get together. Yet he was ready to place in their hands such invoices of goods as these.
Also with a reference to Page 2, line 19, etc., etc. Buck has done business enough here to know that he could not travel all over the Department on the word of a Provost Marshal's clerk; nor on a mere certificate that he had taken the Oath: that the permission from the commanding officer, which he had to get for every one of his imports and exports, was vastly more necessary for trading over the lines.
Also with reference to Page 2, line 31. Judge Stackpole's verdict released vessels and goods from confiscation, but did not allow them to resume the voyage. Buck then for the first time came in to ask for that permit. It was disapproved at once.
Also in reference to Page 3, line 3: This relates to large quantities of old junk that Buck tried to export, containing brass, copper, etc., etc., stolen from Navy Yard, etc. Also with a reference to Page 1, line 24, Buck here admits a fact, which Whitehurst denied and confessed again -- half a dozen times in as many minutes, when questioned by me. Buck had a large quantity of old junk, rags, cotton, and staves to export. Finding all his permits retained until the question of theft should be settled, he brought in Peter Whitehurst to his aid, who in three different applications tried to export Buck's goods. These were identified by the harbor police in spite of Whitehurst's repeated assertions and angry protestations, Shifting of permits and invoices from one party to
another is inadmissible in these troublous times; and should subject both parties to a stoppage of all further privileges. Thus Buck's case grew worse with Whitehurst's help. I made up my mind that Buck's acquisitiveness was much larger than his loyalty or his rectitude. Moreover, I learned that his partner in Baltimore, Denison, has been from the first a known secessionist, active in word, if not in deed. This I gathered from the confessions of Peter Whitehurst himself.
I therefore enclosed all the papers in the case, Feb. 12th, and forwarded them to Major Robert S. Davis, A. A. G. They returned with this letter of transmittal:

My dear General: A copy of the book has gone to M. Goncet; also one to Gen. E. T. Thompson, at your request.
I have a little information for you. Mr. Hamilton, who has been for the last year correspondent in New Orleans for the N. Y. Daily Times, has just returned. Before leaving New Orleans, he wrote a private letter to the Editor of the paper, of 20 pages, giving a true statement of the state of things in that
city -- which he could publish or not, as he thought best. The substance of it was that the people of New Orleans, both Unionists and secessionists, were utterly dissatisfied with the rule of Gen. Banks, whom he represented to be a petty despot and totally unequal to the situation, vacillating, weak, and without ideas. He also said that the universal wish of the people was for your return, and that no class desired it more than the incurable secesh. They say that from you they always could get an answer, and knew what they had to expect, and could make permanent arrangements for the future, as they could rely on your word. From him they get smiles, politeness, and palaver, but nothing that really helps them out of their difficulties.
From the same source I learn why no such letter as this can get into the Times. Raymond is busy, night and day, in writing a history of Lincoln's administration. His object is France. He wants the French mission, which, says my informant, he is to have if Lincoln is re-elected.
All this comes direct from the lips of the correspondent mentioned above. He adds that Raymond, in his haste to get into his book, neglects the paper entirely.
Those Germans will be the death of us. The copy is not all in the printer's hands even yet, though it is nearly. Everything possible has been and is done to hurry them. The printer, however, is close upon their heels, so that the book is mostly stereotyped.
The large edition has now sold 11,000, and still goes well. It is decidedly the most successful book of the season.
With our regards to Mrs. Butler, we both remain,

He came from Wilmington, and 25,000 pounds of iron was on the same train for this identical gun-boat. The general writes that other parties from near Garysburg, who have not seen the boat, confirm the reports of the shipment of iron. He adds the following: ""In view of the possibility of such a monster coming down, it would be well, I think, to procure the hulks, if practicable, and cause them to be sunk in suitable places.""
Admiral Lee gives no authority for the light boats, but I will send a copy of your letter to General Wells for his guidance, and as his authority to sink said boat when the necessities of the defense require it. I will send an officer of the quartermaster's department to your headquarters for any old hulks that can be spared.

"February 23, 1864","From General Butler
Hd. Qrs. Dept. of Va. and N. C., Fortress Monroe, Feb. 23rd, 1864
The President of the United States
Sir: I have to apologize to you for the long delay in reporting my action in relation to the complaint of Gov. Pierpont of E. Virginia. It took so long to get the proper returns from the various officers in the cities of Norfolk and Portsmouth, and they were so imperfect, and it took so much time to collect and put them in order so as to give results, and it was so difficult also to find time to give personal examination thereto, that I have failed till today to get opportunity to report as fully as I wish in regard to the action of the civil and military Government in this Department.
With your leave, I will first discuss the specific complaints
of Gov. Pierpont, and then will call your attention to some of the consideration of policy for future action.
The first complaint is Order No. 40, which requires the payment of one per cent upon merchandise brought into the Department, a copy of which order is appended. I found it necessary to employ large numbers of officers, soldiers, clerks, and messengers, at great expense to the United States, for the purpose of watching, guarding, and regulating trade in their insurrectionary districts, and to prevent smuggling. I found a large portion of my time and that of one member of my staff employed in investigations regarding it. Now, it seemed to me but just that, as this trade was carried on, emolument of parties engaging in it was usually very profitable, that its expense should be paid by them and not by the Government and therefore issued the order that one per cent should be paid upon it to defray its expense. As an ordinary rule of political economy, it is true that a tax upon trade is a tax upon the consumer, but it is only the rule where trade in course of time and with full competition has found its strict level, but it is not true as applicable to the limited and special trade carried on in this insurrectionary district of a speculative character, with a percentage not founded upon any exact ratio between the supply and the demand. Therefore this tax is borne by the trader and not by the consumer, and thus falls where it should; but as a large share of the expense of the trade to the Government must be borne by the United States, from the fact that its officers and soldiers must necessarily be employed in taking care of it, a fund must accumulate, although I have endeavored to employ civilians in the Provost Marshals' office, and other offices, and pay them from it as much as possible.
In regard to the permits it was important that some restrictions should be had upon persons going into and coming out of the Department for their own pleasure, otherwise my officers would be overrun by applications for permits and passports by the pleasure-seeking, idle, and curious. Indeed, I have had an application while in Command of this Department to allow excursion steamers, bringing thousands of that class, to come here on pleasure trips, as a matter of speculation on the part of the party getting up the enterprize. But when informed of the necessary outlay for permits to come in and go out, the speculation was abandoned as a non-paying project.
Governor Pierpont was misinformed when he said there was a passport fee required for going to or from any place in the
Department. Such was never required, but only a fee when the applicant was coming in or going out of the Department. This required the administration of the Oath of Allegiance, a record of the parties named and description, and a pass, and the fee was little enough; but that permit fee has since been abandoned because it was sometimes found to act erroneously on those coming into the Department, to see their friends and relations in the army. But Governor Pierpont says that this import of one per cent is a ""tax which cannot be collected."" It is not obligatory upon anybody. Nineteen-twentieths of all the trade is in the hands of non-residents of the Department. If these non-residents do not wish to pay the tax, they need not ask for permits to trade. They ask facilities of the United States, and they are simply told that they can have them for what it cost the United States to furnish them. They ask the United States to guard and protect their trade in the special manner, and we ask them to pay for that special guard and protection. Precisely as if they should ask that their goods should be carried on a Government transport, we should ask them to pay for the transportation. Governor Pierpont says that the money thus received goes to the fund to support the Provost Marshal's Office.
That unfortunately is not true in its full extent, because the Provost Marshals and most of their assistants are United States Officers, and soldiers, and must be paid in another form. What then is to be done with the money? It will be paid into the Treasury of the United States in form as well as in fact, if the President so directs. But there are special expenses to which the United States is put in occupying large towns, and the feeding and care of citizens for which no appropriations have been made and which must be paid by the Quarter Master's Department by Special Order from the Commanding General, so that in fact the expenditure is entirely under his direction.
Now, I found the streets, wharves, and squares of Norfolk in a most filthy, ruinous, and disordered state, so much so that life and limb are not safe upon them to the wayfarer, and in the coming summer, pestilence must ensue like the yellow fever of '53 unless large expenditures are made in cleansing and purifying them.
I found the fire department entirely disorganized and its material out of repairs and useless.
The city was unlighted for months, and the Gas Company
being largely disloyal had refused to put their works in operation, so that it was impossible to properly guard or police it. Without discussing at present the rights and duties of the City Government in this behalf, but finding them utterly powerless to remedy this state of things, it seemed to me both necessary and just that as these streets, wharves and squares were used by traders who have no interest in the town, who are here only for temporary and speculative purposes, and are contributing nothing in the way of taxation for its support, that the fund should be used as far as it would go for the cleansing and repairs of the streets and furnishing the city with fire engines. I am therefore using that portion of the fund which comes from the trade of Norfolk and Portsmouth for that purpose. I have already lighted the city, after having made large outlays for the repair of the gas-works, which will be returned to me from the proceeds of the gas, and am employing my convicts who are sentenced to hard labor in cleansing the streets and repairing them, furnishing tools and supplies for that purpose from this fund. Why do I not leave this appropriate work to the city authority? I beg leave to answer that in another portion of my report, and content myself now with saying that I will prove hereafter that the City Government is powerless for these purposes. Now, will Governor Pierpont or anybody else say that the one per cent tax collected in the manner and from the persons I have mentioned and expended judicially as I have indicated, is wrong or oppressive on the part of the United States or its Officers towards the Citizens of Norfolk? The next subject of complaint on the part of Governor Pierpont is in regard to the action of my Provost Court and Provost Marshal, who, he says ""are taking cognizance of all civil and military causes from ejectment to getting drunk in the city.""
I am sorry that Governor Pierpont is not more accurate in his statements or in his information. It is quite true that I received a letter from him making inquiries upon the subject of civil jurisdiction of the courts, and I replied to him, as he admits, ""that my instructions were, that no debts should be collected save against those who are in rebellion against the United States, in favor of loyal citizens, and where the property might escape from the honest creditor by reason of confiscation."" I could further have told him that no other civil suits would be entertained by the Provost Court except in cases wherein the Military authorities of the Department are
in some way called upon to protect loyal citizens from wrong, or being thrown upon the United States for support generally through persecution of some semi-rebel creditor who has taken the Oath of Allegiance, or as he phrases, it, has ""taken out a protection"" for his property, and then brings suit in the corporation court against some true Union man, who has been struggling on aiding the Government, while the plaintiff was in rebellion.
Besides, as it is necessary to keep a military guard in Norfolk, as it was until a very recent period, and perhaps is now, to prevent rebel sympathizers from murdering Union Officers in the streets, so it is necessary in my judgment that there should be a wholesome fear of the Provost Court to prevent the same rebel sympathizers from oppressing true Union men under the form of not too well-established law. Until very lately I doubt if a jury could have been found in Norfolk whom it would have been safe to trust upon a question in dispute between the ""hated Yankee"" and that boastful but now rather crest-fallen individual who begins every statement by, ""I was born in Virginia, Sir.""
To the remark of Governor Pierpont that whenever debts are collected a commission is taken by the Provost Court, the readiest and most just reply is that it is untrue. To the further statement that all fines imposed in that Court go to support the Provost Marshal's Office, I can only say that that is an equally wide departure from the truth which can only be accounted for in Governor Pierpont, it would seem to me, by the proverb ""that out of the abundance of the heart the mouth speaketh,"" because on the only occasion upon which the Commander of this Department has had the honor of receiving a call from Governor Pierpont, His Excellency made an application to him to buy the supply of coal necessary for making gas for Norfolk from His Excellency's coal mine, which he recommends in the highest terms. But as I had already made a coutract for a supply from Pickton, I looked too coolly on the proposition, and therefore, perhaps, ""hinc illae lacrimae,"" and this, may I be allowed to say in passing, is the only coöperation I have received from His Excellency in aid of crushing the Rebellion. To the specific accusation of Governor Pierpont against the Provost Court, I have appended the report of the Judge, who is abundantly able to take care of himself. Another complaint of His Excellency Governor Pierpont is in these words, ""Another act of General Butler's I will mention,
which is a gross assumption of power in my estimation. He has issued orders for enrolling and conscripting all the white men in his district able to bear arms."" The answer to this charge is, First, that the order for enrolling was given by direct authority of the President of the United States, through the Secretary of War, and to the War Department. I leave the adjustment with Governor Pierpont of the assumption of power.
But there is one statement of Governor Pierpont, as a reason why no enrollment of white men should be permitted in Virginia, too remarkable to be allowed to pass without observation. He says the people in General Butler's District have furnished more troops, according to population, than any other people in the United States, but they have been mostly black. ""They (the people not the blacks) claim to be placed on the same footing as Maryland and Kentucky as to conscription."" There has been a recruiting force of several men for six months in that portion of Virginia in Gen'l, Butler's District, comprising most of Governor Pierpont's dominions, and they have not yet been able to recruit of loyal white Virginians a single company, and I desire to bear testimony to the zeal and efficiency of the recruiting officers. And further, in regard to the black troops of which more than four thousand (4000) have been recruited in this Department, thus speaking well for their patriotism, the only aid in that behalf received from the white men of Virginia has been that every master that could make decent pretence of loyalty has been besieging my recruiting officers for three hundred (300) dollar certificates as payment from the United States for the black men they had recruited. And the only assistance in the recruitment received from the State Government by the Commanding General was a polite offer by the Governor to furnish commissions to the officers of the black troops which the United States Government raised in Virginia, a proposition which I respectfully referred to the War Department, for myself declining to take either coal or commissions from the Governor.
Governor Pierpont further asks that General Butler be not allowed to interfere with his banks of the State. True it is that the Generals who preceded me in command of this Department, acting in accordance with Governor Pierpont's notions, did not deem it their duty to interfere with the banks of the State, and the consequence has been that months after the possession of Norfolk and Portsmouth by the Federal troops the banks of those cities sent away to Richmond many hundred
thousands [of] dollars of their assets to support the rebellion. My only interference with the banks thus far has been to order a Commission to examine into the condition of the savings banks, and endeavor to rescue something from the remainder thereof to relieve the white poor of Norfolk and Portsmouth, for whose support the Government has expended sixty thousand ($60,000) dollars annually, and I succeeded so far so well in that regard that my Commission have found about thirty thousand ($30,000) of funds belonging to the poor which had been hidden with the purpose of forwarding to the Confederacy. If the President could yield to the request of Governor Pierpont, however, I will not interfere with the banks of Norfolk and Portsmouth, and will allow the remainder of their assets to be forwarded to the Confederacy, if such shall be the policy.
Another, and perhaps the gravest charge made upon the military authorities of this Department, because Governor Pierpont twice recurs to it in his communication to the War Department, is ""that I have interfered with the Government of the cities of Norfolk and Portsmouth by ordering the officials of those cities to make returns to me of their receipts and expenditures."" In that regard, the head and front of my offending hath this extent, no more: and it is the waiting for these reports which have so long delayed the answer to the complaints of Governor Pierpont, perhaps the best justification of the circumstances which led to it, and a short detail of the result as seen in the condition of the reports of the official of that city. The City Government of Norfolk and Portsmouth have been in operation since June, 1863, with a full corps of officers, and, as I have said, the streets were uncleaned and unrepaired, the city was unwatched to such extent that incendiary fires were of frequent occurrence and indeletable, the fire engines were out of repair and useless, the wharves and bridges ruinous, the schools unopened, and the poor, whether black or white, unfed and uncared for, save that they were clamorous at the Commissaries and Quarter Masters of the United States for fuel, provisions, and clothing, which appeals we were obliged to answer. At the same time, I observed that every occupation was taxed, and excise put upon every business so that a poor woman could not keep a few boarders for her support without paying twenty dollars for a license, a negro could not drive a hack without paying ten dollars, a farmer could not sell a bushel of potatoes without paying ten
cents, and every stall in the market was rented for one dollar per year, all of which burdens seemed to come directly upon the very poorest class, and were brought to my notice because a widow woman complained to me that she was fined twenty dollars before the Mayor's Court for boarding five Union officers without a license. This led to an inquiry into the sources of revenue of these cities, and I found that they received substantially no revenue except from imposts for licenses. As I could see no evidence of any expenditure by the City Government, as care of the city came upon the United States, I thought it my duty to ask for returns of how much money was received, and what was done with it.
You will see that I did not take the course which Governor Pierpont has done with my officers, and charge upon the city officials without knowledge that its revenues must be imperfectly expended, but ask for report and information. These returns have exhibited some remarkable statistics, to which I beg leave to call your attention. The entire receipts of the City of Norfolk for the six months ending January 1st, 1864, were $13,241.20 of which was received,
From licenses to traders$7,536.99
From hacks and drays$900.36
From rent of stalls in market$1,750.30
From clerk of market for hucksters$1,344.60
From fines and cost of petty offences tried by mayor$852.45
From fees from harbor masters from oyster boats$110.25
SubTotal$12,494.95
From sales of offal from streets$135.00
From taxation of real and personal property$611.25
Total$13,241.20
Thus it will be seen that out of the total receipts of $13,241.20, $12,494.95 was a tax upon the actual necessaries of life, in the sliape of licenses to do business and fines upon the poor, and $611.25 only of taxation upon the properly, while the United States was called upon to expend over $20,000 in the same time to support the white poor of that city.
But the expenditure of this sum is quite remarkable:
Expended in streets$2,821.35
of which
For labor, mostly to master of hired negroes$2,751.05
For watch pay roll$3,696.06
For incidental expenses of City Government$563.70
For expenses of committee to Washington$300.00
For salaries of officials besides fees$4,934.40
Total$12,245.21
Thus it will be seen that of the $13,000 expenditures, $12,000 has been paid for the salaries of the City officials and laborers of high and low degree, and their incidental expenses, and that $1,346.06 has been expended for the poor, and $30 for all other city purposes.
The returns from the City of Portsmouth exhibit a still more remarkable state of finances.
It appears that the total receipts, exclusive of fees received and appropriated by the City officials in the City of Portsmouth, for the six months ending Jany. 1st 1864 is $2,635.02, of which
Received from licenses of traders, hucksters and markets, $2,170.21
Received from fines by Mayor, $318.38
Received from taxes on real and personal property, 
While the total expenditures for all city purposes other than salaries and office expenses of the City Government, including $135.69½ for the support of the poor is, $1285.59; while the amount of salaries of City officials necessary to make these expenditures is $2500.00, making it necessary to pay more than two dollars to expend one, although it is but fair to say that owing to the want of revenue more than one-half of the salaries are still due.
It will be seen by examination of the condensed returns annexed hereto that the largest item of expenditures in both cities was for the watch, which now the military patrol renders utterly useless, but the watch is still kept up upon the theory of having been elected for one year they have a vested right and cannot be discharged. It will also be observed that it requires a salary of four hundred dollars per year for an almshouse keeper to expend one hundred and thirty dollars and sixty-nine and one-half cents.
It is but just, however, to many of the good and true men who hold the offices in these cities, that this extraordinary state of things is not to be attributed to them but to the powerlessness of a Civil Government in a disturbed state of society to enforce an observance of its ordinances, and to administer the Government except where the burden falls on the poor and helpless, whom at the same time it is powerless to protect.
The large portion of the property owners are either in rebellion, and their property in the hands of the United States for confiscation, or they are absentees, or they are property holders of real estate only, and the taxes have been so irregularly
assessed and the Civil Government so uncertain in its powers that the attempt to lay any considerable tax is futile and unproductive, as no one fears a lien on his property which is thus created; and it is therefore because of the fact that the United States holds so large a portion of the property in Virginia, not subject to taxation, that I have thought it but just that the Government should bear a portion of the burden of the care of the city, the means to do which have been supplied by the one per cent taxation upon the trade I have herein discussed.
The question, therefore, which addresses itself strongly to my judgment, and to which I wish to call the attention of the President is whether the United States should permit thirty thousand ($30,000) dollars to be taken from the poorer classes of Norfolk and Portsmouth in the shape of licenses, fines, and fees for the purpose of paying for the working of City Governments which have no power to do anything except to draw their salaries of its officials, and in Portsmouth not enough to do even that, while the United States Government is at the same time expending more than double that sum for the poor of the cities from which it is taken, and in taking care of the Fire and Police Departments, and school for the black children, the white going without, would it not be well for the Commanding General to submit to the citizens of these two cities the question whether, so long as it is found necessary to maintain military occupation of their cities, they will set up and maintain any Civil Government. In Elizabeth City Co., and in Princess Anne Co., outside of Norfolk and Portsmouth, there is none other than military government, and it is difficult to perceive why the loyal citizens of those counties are not as well taken care of and protected as the citizens of Norfolk and Portsmouth.
It will be observed that I have not touched upon the taxation for the support of the State Government, which is also mainly derived from licenses. That is a subject upon which I will not extend observations unless Governor Pierpont desires me so to do, in which case some results may be obtained which may render the benefit of the State Government of Virginia to its loyal citizens as questionable as are these of the City Government of Norfolk and Portsmouth.
In conclusion, permit me to say that I am glad that the complaint of Governor Pierpont has given me an opportunity to bring to the notice of the President these details of administration,
which necessarily intrude themselves upon and must be dealt with by the Department Commander, but with which I should not otherwise have thought proper to trouble the Chief Executive. I have the honor to be,

Sir: The despatch of the Secretary of War was received in regard to a Mr. T. H. Vanderhoof, and his removal from North Carolina by my order, some days since. It would have been at once answered had it not been for the raid of the enemy, which had prevented up to this time my getting a formal report from the officers from whom I received the information on which my action was based.
This will excuse the delay, which the Secretary will do me the favor to admit rarely happens in answering orders, and I am not now able to furnish the particulars but from memory, the causes of my order.
Mr. Vanderhoof made accusations against one of the officers of the Army of the Department of North Carolina, which were carefully investigated and turned out to be malicious and apparently groundless and without foundation; that this act had been more than once repeated; and that Mr. Vanderhoof had been stirring up strife and difficulty among the officers and citizens in that District. The last complaint, however, was made by Vanderhoof anonymously, through a member of Congress, so as apparently to shield him from the consequence of this information. I had sent for Vanderhoof as a witness, but the report and the investigation established so overwhelmingly the entire loyalty and propriety of action of the accused, and were accompanied with such statements in regard to Mr. Vanderhoof, that I concluded that his presence in the Department was not of advantage to the armies of the United States. Of course, this was the only question that I could determine in regard to him, because, not being a citizen of North Carolina, he had no right there if his business was in the slightest degree detrimental, and therefore I directed that he should no longer remain in the Department. If the Secretary desires, I will continue the investigation, and cause a report to be made of the other facts and evidence to him, but I suppose this was a case where what was done to Mr. Vanderhoof would be damnum absque injuria, of which he would have no right to complain. As I do not know Mr. Vanderhoof, and have acted only on the information of others without minute personal investigation, I have no pride of opinion in the case, and shall not take if to heart if the Secretary should see fit to send him back, though I think such action would not aid us.

66 Park Ave., Brooklyn, March 6, 1864 Major Gen. B. F. Butler, Comd'g Dept. of Va. & N. C.
Dr. Sir: I have just received word from you through the Secretary of War. I did not go to him out of any disrespect to you, but as I was denied the privilege of seeing you, and was hurried off that afternoon from your place, I went to Washington and there got a member of Congress to introduce me to the Secretary of War, and I laid my case before him and asked him to write to you to find out what I had been sent out of the Dept. for.
In April last I was appointed Superintendent of Contrabands at Washington, N. C. by Col. H. C. Biggs, Chief Quartermaster, and while there in the discharge of my duty the information came to me through the teamsters and others that carted the stuff out, that the Quartermaster was sending it out to the lines and receiving sealed letters. I went and saw the man that brought the letters, and he gave them to Mr. Houghton, Chief Clerk of the Quartermaster. After getting this information, I went to Newbern and laid the whole subject before Col. Biggs, and he said that I must prefer the charges over my own signature, and I done as he ordered me to do, and it seems hard that I should be punished for doing what my officer said was my duty as a Government officer.
I have a copy of the charges and what the men was willing to swear to, and if you would like to see them I will send them to you, and I think that when you read them you will say that what I done was right.

Sir: On my return from Point Lookout, I found your note of inquiry through Col. Hardie as to Mrs. Morris having obtained a pass from these Headquarters to cross our lines, and to take with her some baggage. It is quite true that I gave Mrs. Morris the pass to cross our lines. It is also true that she is the wife of Capt. Morris, a signal officer of the Confederate Army, and that she had availed herself of the pass with her children, and their personal baggage, all of which was duly examined before she left. The Secretary will do me the favor to remember that when in Washington, for purposes which I then stated to him, and which it would not be best to repeat here, I asked and received his permission to allow Mrs. Morris to go across the lines, and I believe the service of the United States has been, and will be helped by the permission.

To the President of the United States
Jared D. Thompson, who had made application for a commission in a negro regiment, lately went to Washington as an advocate for Col. Nelson, who is now under examination upon charges. On his return, Thompson was retailing a supposed conversation alleged to be had between the President and himself, which tended to weaken the authority and undermine the discipline of the Commander of this Department. One of the versions of this story was that the President had determined to remove the present Commanding General in a few days, another version is the one contained in the annexed papers. Believing that I possessed the confidence of the President, and conscious that I had done nothing which could justly cause the loss of it, I did not and do not believe the story told by Thompson.
I therefore sent for him and after hearing the story as he detailed it, I informed him that I could not believe that the President had made to any stranger such remarks about one of his Department Commanders, that the reason given for putting me in command because of public meetings, when the President did not believe me suitable to a command, so totally beneath the dignity of a great Ruler and Statesman
was so improper as wholly to challenge this belief -- and that I should be obliged to deal with him as a person who was at once slandering the Commander-in-Chief and undermining my authority. Thompson then desired to be put under Oath, and made the annexed statement which I forward for the President's information. My only desire is that the President will say that this supposed conversation did not take place, so that I may properly punish this retailer of slander, and I hold him awaiting the answer, although the probability is so strong as to amount to moral certainty, yet acting judicially I think that I ought to make the matter more than morally certain before final action. I have the honor to be,

2. The privilege of selecting such assistants and laborers, and securing such tools and seeds as are necessary, also the use and control of a wagon train, and the use of a hundred condemned horses.
3. The privilege of buying of the Government or elsewhere -- at cost or appraisal -- all the forage, seeds, and subsistence stores that are needful; also of purchasing such old wagons, carts, ambulances, and harness and tools, as have become unserviceable; to loan or sell to those who work the farms.

4. The privilege of locating the surplus contrabands where they can be most advantageously used and cared for.

Col. West, Comdg. at Yorktown, Va.
Colonel: I send you by Mr. Frazer, a refugee from Virginia, an order for a small force to be sent on board a gunboat. If Capt. Babcock will assist Mr. Frazer in procuring some tobacco of his near West Point I think the cause will be benefitted by so doing.
It occurring to me that while doing this we might also accomplish one or two other matters of importance, I would call your attention to the following suggestions and statements:
There is, residing just opposite the White House at Indian-town, a Mr. Evan Bradbury, who is the chief man of the place, an Indian by descent, who has befriended several of the escaped officers from Richmond on their way to our lines. The five who reached me yesterday were hid by him for three or four days. Mr. Bradbury acted as guide for General Keys up the Peninsula, but was never paid for his services. He was afterwards taken by the Rebels and imprisoned in Castle Thunder for seven weeks, but for want of real proof against him was released by the Rebel authorities. Of course he and his fellow-townsmen, many of whom are Unionists, are obliged to keep on good terms with the authorities of Virginia and of the Confederacy, and we should do nothing to compromise them. Mr. Bradbury, however, I desire to see, and wish you would send there and have him arrested. This should of course be done so as not to excite suspicion among the Rebels, but I desire that the officer whom you send in charge of the party making the arrest should say privately to Mr. Bradbury that. I wish to see him upon a little business, and that the arrest is made only to lull all suspicion.
There is also residing near Elthan a gentleman whom I believe to be a true Unionist, and one willing to serve us, named Hill. I desire also that he should be arrested and sent to me. The same instructions apply to his case as in that of Mr. Bradbury. Mr. Frazier will act as guide for you, or direct you to Hill house.
There is, still further, a negro named John Caffey residing at Perkins Bay, six miles above Bigelow's, on the other side of the river (near Gloucester), who also acted as a guide to some of our escaped officers. This man lives almost directly in the pathway of the gunboats, and has lost some of his property, such as his oyster boats, etc., by reason of them.
I desire you to send him or rather to give him the enclosed safeguard from me, and give him the sum of fifty dollars from the secret service fund. Let him understand that I send it to him to redeem the pledge made to him by two of our officers (those who came in last), and as a reward for his services, which we hope will be extended in future to any of our men whom he may meet with who need aid.
I desire for reasons which you will at once understand that the names of all these parties, and the facts given above, should be kept secret, save such as you may be obliged to mention to the officer in charge of the men making the arrest, etc. Let him be an active, shrewd, and energetic man, and one in whom you place confidence. Mr. Bradbury and Mr. Hill when arrested will be at once sent to me under guard.
I am informed that there is at present time in Gloucester County a regiment of cavalry, home there recruiting. They scout and are picketed through the County, merely for their own safety. Many of them are not armed save with revolvers, and rather poorly mounted. Can they not be captured or driven out of the County? In order to do it, it may be necessary to capture or drive out every white man in the county, as they are or would be, should we go there, mixed up so with the inhabitants that it would be difficult to distinguish them from the inhabitants. I desire that you would attend to these matters at once. I have the honor to be,

Sir: I have just returned from City Point and bring the accompanying communication. Major Mulford assures me
upon his own personal knowledge that General Butler is in favor of a general exchange and release of prisoners, and further that he is entirely satisfied of his ability to consummate the same. He distinctly declares that he is authorized to say so. Major Mulford never yet has deceived me, and I am very much inclined to believe what he says. Butler has evidently set his heart, for some reason or other, on securing the release of the Yankee prisoners. He would hate a failure in that direction after recognition more than a refusal to recognize him. In his estimation the former would damage him more than the latter. If Butler's recognition is an impossibility in the present condition of affairs, I think that upon an interview with him as Commanding General at Fort Monroe I could get a distinct written agreement from him for a general exchange. The difficulty occurring to my mind about that arrangement is that he might require some pledge as to slaves. If he is now recognized as an agent I am quite sure I can avoid that difficulty. The flag-of-truce boat remains at City Point to await your decision. The subject is environed with so many difficulties that I hesitate to pronounce any judgment in the premises.

Sir: I have the honor to report in the case of Henry M. Day, 2nd Lieut. Company ""E,"" 1st United States Colored, in answer to an order endorsed upon the back of his letter, the following reasons for his dismissal. Henry M. Day was reported to me under arrest, as having been repeatedly drunk in the public streets of Portsmouth, disgracing the service, and as having gone into camp drunk, and grossly insulting the Commanding Officer of his Regiment. Upon this report being made, I sent for Lieut. Day, and personally examined his case. He confessed to the habit of intoxication, and it appearing to me that the habit was a confirmed one, and that he disgraced the service, I ordered his dismissal, stating the reason thereof. It is my universal course, without exceptions, never to dismiss an officer without hearing his own statement in his own defence, and forwarding immediately to the Adjutant General's Office a copy of the order of dismissal, which always contains the reasons for my action.
Finding after this order of dismissal that Day was attempting to exercise some command, I directed him to leave the Department.
Some time in January, being in Washington, Lt. Day's father called upon me and desired his restoration. I informed him that if I could be sure that Lieut. Day had reformed, and would not return to his vicious habits, I should be glad that he be reinstated, and if he would send his son down to Fortress
Monroe, there to do duty as a private in a regiment stationed at that Fortress, immediately under my eye, so that I could be sure that for three months he did not indulge in drinks, that such exhibition of penitence and self-control would so far recommend him that I myself would ask the President to reverse my own Order. To this I understood his father, who is a lawyer in Washington, to consent, but I heard nothing of young Day until I received instructions to make this report. I cannot believe it possible that the War Department, or the President, can desire that a man who is repeatedly drunk in the public streets, disgracing the uniform he wears, and who exhibits himself in that condition as an officer, to his command, and there insults his commanding officer and all the facts are found to be true upon his own confession, which I have in writing, to be returned to the service, to demoralize other men, and to the entire breaking down of all discipline, until he has at least shown some signs of penitence, and acts in conformity therewith.

While under arrest I wrote him a letter saying that I felt much grieved at what had occurred, and hoped that he would overlook the matter, if not for my sake, for the sake of those who expected better things of me. I also stated that I had insulted him, for which I begged his pardon. After keeping me in arrest five days, he forwarded my communication to Genl. Butler.

I am the man who, meditating on the bed, rose in the night, struck a light, and wrote you a long letter at the time you relieved suffering humanity at Old Point C., and honored God, who, according to the Book, says ""that them that honor Me, I will honor."" Hence not only your valuable life is continued, but the whole Nation has you in reverence and deserved honor. Your kind and noble heart responded at once, and then again 3 months after, many who saw it eulogized the sentiments contained.
In letting it pass under the eye of friends, it got lost or mislaid. It was appreciated by all, both Saints and Sinners. I felt the loss as I desired your autograph. Can I presume on your patience for a short letter?
My old neighbor ""Honest Abe"" knows all about me, for I am 65 past, 42 of which in this place (Springfield). A frail, erring man, raised a farmer, yet I love and fear God, and love His precious word, from which I always take my platform.
The 7th Chapter of Joshua will explain the long ""Spell"" on the army of the Potomac. We have the Achan at Washington, with all the men and means desired now 3 years, they cannot get a victory. Why are there not wise men enough to search the cause? A concise point.
""There is an accursed thing in the midst of Israel. Thou canst not stand before thine enemies until ye take away the accursed thing from among you.""
Joshua feared God and obeyed Him. If Mr. Lincoln would do likewise, the smiles of Heaven would rest upon us within a month, and success attend all our movements. Did you know, General, that a certain head man at Washington sympathies were so strong towards the Rebels, that when in St. Louis he gave an old rebel a pass to take his ""truck and plunder"" through his lines down into Arkansas, together with 15 slaves; was this aiding Lincoln or Jeff Davis? This Nation is bleeding, and it is just, and ought to bleed, and will bleed until we put away the accursed thing. With my knowledge of the Will of God and His Holy Word, I would quickly cast overboard
Halleck, Blair, Bates, and Seward, any or all who has sympathies with slavery.
The whole system is of the D--1. It certainly is antagonistic to the Spirit of Christ. The magnitude of the crime is indicated by the penalty. What is the penalty in America? Let the graves of half a million, the widows and orphans answer.
Dear General, did you know the secret of your late failure towards Richmond? Who inclined a spy to go ahead; who was slow to give any aid; who gave a cold apparently indifferent answer to your solicitations? General, a wise man searches out causes for all events. The whole system is opposed to the will of the Almighty, ""Who is no respecter of persons,"" how can He consistently bless or approve? The case is clearly an issue with the Great God, our maker. Oh what presumption for puny man! Another abomination is the paying for slaves, to the man who has robbed him of 10 or 20 years wage already.
God's will is clearly expressed in the case of Pharaoh, a case in point. Take from the slave dealer or oppressor and give to the oppressed; see Exodus 12; 32, 35, 36, and 37 verses. This is God's will and this is justice. Paying a robber is Judas-like, a wicked precedent, an impeachment of the Divine Law, an abomination not found in the Bible of the most Godless Nation known.
Again, the Doctrine of ""State Rights,"" is another ""Humbug."" As if a Corporation Law could over ride the State Law, the Constitution of the U. S., which Constitution was ordained to establish justice, and carries out the principal of the Dec. of Ind. It is consistent with itself if fairly interpreted and Legal construction given it. It is all right now.
The foundations of our Government are laid no firmer than the foundations of Justice and Humanity. And the Doctrine of ""State Rights,"" to enslave its own citizens, is preposterous and one to be ignored by every American Citizen. The loyalty of Border State men that make Slavery paramount to the Government is a loyalty this Nation can better spare than keep. No peace until the magic word ""Universal Emancipation"" is uttered. So may be it. Amen.
Dear General, be so kind as to drop me a line to keep with my old friend Abraham's.
Yours truly, Erastus Wright
N. B. When this war is over, General, please take a trip out ""to the Great West,"" to this richest part of the world, and come to my house and stay a week at least; see old Abe's stamping

I write this in the Treasury Department with the letter of Genl. Butler to the Secretary before me; it is dated July 2nd, 1862. It was supposed by the Secretary that as the letter of Genl.

Sir: You will remember when in Washington I spoke to you of sending Howard to Richmond for information, with
means of communicating with me, and also with special directions to ascertain if possible by what means the Rebels got intelligence from Washington. As a means of correspondence I gave him a sympathetic ink, and by the last flag-of-truce received the enclosed letter. The cross-writing thereof you will understand at once. If you have such clerks as Judge Ould's brother-in-law and Harrison in your Department, I think you will be safe in arresting them. Howard is not likely to be mistaken. I have marked this confidential because it concerns a man's life, and it would seem that the clerks are not always to be trusted, and I will take measures to place this letter in your own hands. I have the honor to be, Very Respectfully,
Your obt. serv., B. F. Butler"

It has been the practise of this Department to permit troops not required for service to go home on a short furlough to exercise the election franchise. Several states have provided for taking the votes of volunteers in the field. In others, constitutional restrictions require the actual presence of the voter within the state, and this is said to be the case in New Hampshire.
The General Commanding must determine whether the troops can be spared without prejudice to the service. If they can be spared, you are authorized to give them a short furlough sufficient to go home, vote, and return.
Edwin M. Stanton, Secy. of War."
"March 3, 1864","From General Butler
Headquarters, Dept. Va., and N. C., Fort Monroe, March 3rd, 1864
Hon. Robert Ould, Commdr. of Exchange, Richmond, Va.
Sir: I enclose you copies of a correspondence, so far as received, between Gen. Peck and Gen. Pickett, and instructions to Gen. Peck from myself in regard to the execution of certain men in North Carolina enlisted in the United States Service.
I desire to ask your especial attention to the threat of Gen. Pickett, that he will hang ten men for any retaliation that may be made by Gen. Peck for the murder of men in the
United States Army. If that threat has been made in answer to a claim that deserters from an Army, situated as is yours, were not liable to be executed upon capture if found in arms in our ranks, it might have been possibly justified under the laws of war. But even then the question of the right of executing such persons is still worthy of careful consideration and discussion.
True, Gen. Pickett, having deserted his own flag and the Army of the United States on the 25th June, 1861, would probably know what should be the fate of a deserter found in arms against his Government, but the question will be whether he shall be permitted to allow his own personal feelings to prevail in a matter now in our hands.
I beg you, however, to observe, that this threat was in answer to a claim that a negro soldier enlisted in the army of the United States, and under the protection of its Government, should not be wantonly murdered simply because that while in the field and in the course of military operations he, in pursuance of his duties as a soldier shot a Colonel of the Confederate Army while he was building a Pontoon bridge. A meritorious act on the part of the soldier, and one because of which under no rule of civilized warfare should a hair of his head be injured.
Now, therefore, as I cannot hang any sufficient number of Gen. Pickett's friends or relations, which would be in the nature of a personal retaliation and which ought not to be thought of by the Generals of two Armies in the field, if I proceed to retaliation it must be upon the soldiers and officers of the Confederate Army that I have in my hands, as I shall most assuredly feel it my duty to do unless some period is put to such acts and such threats.
It therefore becomes my duty as Comdg. General of this Department to call upon the Confederate authorities to know of such acts, and that threats are sometimes sanctioned and authorized by them.
I will patiently wait for a sufficient time to elapse in which I can be made acquainted with the course which the Confederate authorities choose to take upon this subject, and then will proceed to such action as I may be advised is proper, to sustain the dignity, power, and justice of the Government I represent.
To avoid all misconception upon that, until full explanation is had with the Confederate authorities, I should not deem it
my duty to execute prisoners of war in retaliation for the execution of deserters from the Confederate Army, should they be found with arms in their hands, because the question should be made the subject of discussion between the two belligerents.
But the question which I desire to submit for authoritative decision on the part of those you represent is whether a soldier of the United States who is duly enlisted, and has not deserted from your Army, and who has committed no act which could be construed as crime, save acts of hostility in the field against the Confederate Armies, whatever may be the color or complexion of that soldier, is to be regarded and located by your authorities as a prisoner of war, and as such entitled to the rights and immunities of such condition.
The most obvious considerations of humanity and mercy will impress more strongly than anything I could say the immediate necessity of placing this matter before your authorities, and I take this method of communication through yourself as the most proper channel through which to discuss questions relating to prisoners of war. I have the honor to be, very respy.,

"March 3, 1864","From N. G. Upham to General Butler
Concord, March 3, 1864
My dear General: I have been long intending to write you, but knowing your engagements consumed every moment of your time, and that there was nothing of a public nature I could speak of where your information was not far greater than mine, I have deferred writing.
I write now impelled by the sudden death of our common friend Capt. George, whom we both fully appreciated. He was in all respects a most uncommon man, far-sighted, and
manifesting often wonderful power. A better friend I know you could not have. This loss, at the present time, I most deeply lament on the country's account, for our own sakes, and that of many mutual friends.
He exerted a power greater than that of almost any man I have ever known, not in position. He made himself felt by his bold, original thought, and strong power of presenting and illustrating it. He felt, as he often expressed it, that brains should rule, and brains clearly was the secret of his strength. He was also a man, as his friends well know, of most scrupulous honor. I mourn his loss most deeply. I hoped we all might go along together through the present crisis, and live to see a fair sky and bright prospects we might enjoy, and talk over hereafter. It was not so to be, and we must struggle on without him. After his return from his very gratifying visit to you at Fortress Monroe he spent a very interesting evening at my house, giving a full account of you all, his tour throughout, and his notes of the times. He seemed in very good health and spirits, and was critically watching the events of the day, in which he has now ceased to participate.
I wish I could see you and talk over this, and other matters. I sometimes fear you may be disheartened. It requires both indomitable faith and courage to keep on with blunderers to the right of us; blunderers to the left of us; blunderers in front of us and over us! But the cause will save us, and not its management.
I have been, with Mrs. U. and my son, most deeply interested in your Memoirs, which we have fully read. Your trying time in getting out to Ship Island with Mrs. Butler, and your troops in your sinking vessel, interested us all very much. I think, having passed through that trial, you can never see a darker hour. I am glad your family is with you. Without that sunlight of home, in which you are so much blessed, I believe you could not stand the excessive labors and annoyances of your position.
The progress of the coming political campaign is yet much in the dark. Lincoln's safety depends on the events of the next sixty days. Any Bull Run achievements would floor him absolutely. If he is down, the tug comes then whether place, or brains shall win. I have not given up hope that Providence may yet give us a President. I think McClellan is the competitor. You know all that can be known of these matters. New Hampshire will just win by excessive effort.
I hope to see Mr. Hildreth before he goes back, and some expect to be in Washington within the next fortnight. I have recently come out with an address here that gives my position on all prominent points in issue. You probably will see it in the Journal, and I hope will agree with me that the true issues of the crisis are presented. Please remember me very kindly to Mrs. Butler, and sister, and your daughter. My wife also desires particular remembrance to yourself, and family.
Very truly your friend, N. G. Upham"

I am somewhat surprised at the letter of the Rev. Henry Ward Beecher, in which he says that on Christmas evening Col. Martin was too convivial. Not a very clegymanlike way of expressing gross drunkenness at a public charitable fair. Upon all matters of religion I will take Mr. Beecher's opinion where I coincide with him, but I would rather he would not interfere with my officers if they are ""too convivial"" members of the Plymouth Church. If I did not think it was for the good of the service to remove Col. Martin I should have reinstated him. I made the dismissal after a full hearing of Col. Martin in person.

Sir: I have the honor to report that on the 4th inst. the commanding officer at the outpost (Barnards Mills) reported the enemy advancing from the village of Suffolk in force. Their line of skirmishers presenting a formidable front for my necessarily small force at that post, I immediately sent the 23d Mass., Col. Elwell, and one section of 3 inch guns to his support, and went to the front to ascertain fully the state of affairs.
I found that they had established a strong line of pickets just without rifle range.
Having placed to the best advantage the small force at hand, I asked for the 27th Mass., which was promptly sent me, and made use of. Information received from deserters and others deterred me from attacking, of which you were duly informed.
On receiving your telegram informing me that reinforcements were on the way, I immediately returned to head Qrs. (leaving the advance in command of Col. Elwell, 23d Mass.) to make the proper disposition of the troops as they arrived. Brig. Gen'l Birney was sent forward to the front with one of his regiments; the 7th. Col. Duncan was assigned to the command at Dower's Hill, one of his Regt's, the 5th, having reënforced that Post, a most important point in case of an attack on our main position.
On Sunday morning, Gen'l Kilpatrick arrived, and kindly offered the service of himself and command. Sunday afternoon
received intelligence that the enemy were retiring. I immediately proceeded to the front, and with the 2d U. S. Cold. Cav., Col. Cole, started in pursuit. From all the information that could be obtained from prisoners and others, I learned that the enemy commenced retiring about 12 o'clock Saturday night, evidently frightened away by the firing from the Admiral's gunboats. I followed them about eight miles beyond Suffolk toward the Blackwater, thoroughly scouring the roads for miles, and am satisfied they are beyond the Blackwater. General Ransom was below Sandy Cross at last accounts, making for the Blackwater. As soon as this demonstration was made in front, I ordered the 10th N. H. Vols. to reënforce Col. Roberts in the District of Currituck, who kept his cavalry constantly at work scouring the country, and reports the canal navigable, and that it has not been interfered with during the recent visit of the enemy.
Col. Roberts is untiring in his efforts to free his district from guerillas and the enemy, and has matters in much better condition than they have been heretofore. Col. Keese of the 118th N. Y. Vols., comd'g. outpost near Deep Creek, has also been vigilant and active with his command. The country is thoroughly patrolled, and reconnoissances are made frequently. Detachments are now out from both Robert's and Keese's commands. Their reports I will forward as soon as they arrive.
Immediately upon my arrival at the front yesterday, finding that the enemy had retired, I at once relieved General Birney and his regiment stationed there, and they have returned. The enemy have disappeared entirely, and all is quiet. I have the honor to be, Gen'l, Very respectfully,
Your ob't serv't, C. A. Heckman, Brig. Genl. Comd'g."

Washington City, March 7th, 1864
My dear General: I was happy to receive your communication of the 5th inst., and to be assured that the misrepresentations of Colonel Nelson had created no permanent misunderstanding.
The bearer of this letter is Mr. C. L. Dimon, who visited us in New Orleans for the purpose of purchasing cotton and sugar. He is now desirous of having access to the tar and turpentine and rosin region of your department. I do not
wish to ask anything for him that is in conflict with any of your regulations, or that is not consonant with the public interests. If, however, you are allowing traders to go to North Carolina for the purpose of purchasing these articles, it will be an obligation to me if you would extend to him the same privileges and facilities which you are extending to others.
I am glad to learn that you are pleased with my speech. I found nothing substantial upon which to place my foot until I imbibed the principles upon which it is based.
Mrs. Deming presents her compliments to Mrs. Butler, and when the weather becomes milder we both intend to accept your invitation and pay you a visit. I am,
Very truly yours, Henry C. Deming."

"March 7, 1864","From S. Wolf to Rev. Dr. McMurdy
Washington, D. C., March 7th, 1864
Dear Doctor: Since conversing with you, I have pondered over matters which were the burden of our conversation, and as a free interchange of opinion must certainly result in eventual good, -- however humble the person offering the same, -- I take this opportunity of expressing my belief in a policy, which for a moment dormant, must and will prevail finally, knowing you, and all of those who adhere to the Doctrine by you advocated, to be thoroughly loyal and National, -- not loyal in the hackneyed lip phraseology, -- I cannot hesitate to avow a corresponding degree of interest for and in behalf of those Eternal principles of Equity and Justice which underlie all good Governments.
Exchange is one of these principles, he who never changes his opinions about Men and Measures is an Emblem of stupidity and fanaticism. Nature constantly resounds with the Grand Requiem of ""passing away."" therefore it is but an indication of Progress, when Man arouses from his torpid slumber, casts off the chains and trammels of Party and faction, and stands resurrected from its fell influence, sublime
and immortal in his efforts for the amelioration of his Race and home.
This Principle being based upon Moral as well as philosophical Truths, it becomes necessary for all true Patriots, who love mankind with sincere devotion, who adore Governments for the good they confer upon the many, to rouse, in this hour of our Nation's greatest Peril. That danger no longer consists of the armed foe in Rebellion, but in the would-be defenders at Home, when the sword has done its duty, the Pen has to achieve a mightier task; it is the next Administration, which is to shape in its Civil policy the destiny of the Republic, and since History teaches by examples, it is not necessary to state that the present administration has most signally failed. Mr. Lincoln may mean well, but he has far greater faculty for perpetuating evil than good, he is a politician never a statesman, he lives, breathes, and has his being in the brief hour that fortune -- ever blind -- has allotted to him, he knows not history and its glorious teachings, he has no aspirations for immortality, is not imbued with those divine principles of progress which mark the era, and encircle the brow with the glorious wreath of genius. Vacillating in policy, undecided in action, weak in intellectual grasp, he writhes in contortions of dissimulation that would do Blondin honor. He has not the moral courage to evoke the genius of Universal Emancipation, and bid him to preside.
The American continent being so constituted as ever to remain one, single and united in purpose and thought, it is highly important that some combination among the friends of our country's future should exist in this hour of its greatest necessity. The War being waged by the friends of liberty, is not to destroy society, upheave the foundations of law, by issuing Ediets, Papal Bulls, or Ukases, but to preserve & unite, and by destroying root and branch of the Monster which has been the skeleton in our household affections, invite every one from the downtrodden shores of Europe to emigrate hither, and thus verify that the ""Star of Empire westward moves.""
The German element, the much unjustly despised Jew, is heart and soul for any movement, which will do away with Vacillation and Buffoonery, they desire some live man at the helm who can by the force of his indomitable will, by the inspiration of his genius, by the grasp of his intellect, steer clear from any base compromises, but win success by the
brilliancy of his actions, whether on the field or in the Cabinet. And I think I am not saying anything not warranted by observation and facts, that we look for such a man in Butler, Fremont, or Chase.
My personal choice would be Gen. Butler, although he has not become acquainted with an honest, intelligent Jew. I trust the day may not be far distant when he will find a host, his admirers and adherents. Hoping you will pardon haste, etc., I am, sir, with great esteem
Very truly your obdt. servt., S. Wolf"

I have received your despatches by the ""Saxon,"" and return her at once. I still think you are mistaken in regard to the designs of the Rebels in North Carolina. I am certain you are as to the disbanding of Lee's Army. I enclose to you a copy of the operations in front of Suffolk where Robinson has been on a foraging expedition.
He crossed the Pasquotank day before yesterday at Franklin. Communication on the Canal has not been interrupted a single day, except a stupid Captain got frightened because some one fired a gun in the woods and came back. With the forces you have we shall expect you to hold North Carolina against all comers. Don't let the Army get frightened at the Ram. She must at least have two feet of water to float in, and with proper vigilance you can take care of her.
If in your report you will send down and get the names of the Commanders of the various Brigades, and then reckon not more than 1800 men to a ""Brigade,"" you will at once test the immense exaggeration of the number of forces. Clingman and Elzey's Brigades have been brought back to Weldon. Furloughs have been granted to many of Lee's Army by companies to go home and recruit themselves, and their horses, until the 31st of March.
I send you some late Richmond papers containing accounts of Kilpatrick's Raid, by which you will see that the Rebels have no intention of interfering with you. But do not relax your vigilance. I have laid your previous despatches before General Halleck, and he tells me that he knows of no troops that can be spared for our Department, so we must work along as we are.

4th. He had a secret box made under his daughter's bedroom floor in which he concealed arms & the plate of another secessionist, & when called to account for it lied about it.

To him is given the highest meed of a soldier's life, a most glorious death; but how can his country supply his place?

I will have sad pleasure in doing everything I can to enable you to receive his remains. I would send a special flag of truce for this if I thought that mode the most effectual, which I do not in the present state of exasperation of the rebels at Richmond. My regular flag of truce will go up to-morrow morning with prisoners, and I will then make such an appeal to the Commissioner Judge as I can, to have your request complied with.
May I suggest the possibility that a personal letter from yourself either to him or some official you may know would aid the purpose?

There is hardly any sacrifice that I would not incur to obtain the remains of my beloved son; but what can I say to the Rebel authorities that might not rather interfere with my purpose, -- for my heart swells with indignation at the accounts given by the Richmond press, and their approval of the inhuman treatment which his dead body received.
My own official position also forbids the least concession that might be construed to lie in the path of duty.

My dear Sir: After ten days of negotiation, with the aid of several Senators, etc., we have reached a definite conclusion in regard to the propeller ""Princeton."" The first point made was that the Treasury Regulations 51, 52, 53, and 54, referred to in the permit, were not yet in force in your Deptmt., and consequently the permit was insufficient. Next, it was contended by the Secretary of the Navy that the ingress and egress of the vessel would be a breach of blockade. After numerous conferences with Mr. Chase and Mr. Welles (the former cordially commending the enterprise as proper and judicious), it was settled upon that the voyage could be made as a military necessity, of which the commandant of the Deptmt. is the sole judge. Letters have been written by Senators Harding, Nesmith, and Pomeroy to you, and by Fred P. Stanton to Admiral Lee. If in your judgment it is wise to send in the ""Princeton"" to obtain information, or to have large amounts of Southern products placed where it may be reached without cost of blood or treasure by the Government, all agree that you have the authority to do so and that Admiral Lee will co-operate heartily.

First. Do you desire to be sent South as a prisoner of war for exchange?
Second. Do you desire to take the oath of allegiance and parole, and enlist in the Army or Navy of the United States, and if so, in which?

General: I have delayed writing you my action in regard to Wingfield. He came here and was examined. He claimed that he was conscientious in what he did; and that he felt it his duty to do so, and so far as I could judge, he appeared to be so. I gave him some time to consider upon the matter, after reasoning with him upon several questions involved in his duties as a citizen; and he informed me that he should return to his allegiance and take the oath; and I have no doubt he will carefully keep it. The difficulty with him is that he is full of Virginia abstractions, and would do right if his logic would let him. He needs very much the rubric of common sense.
I understand that the house he lives in is the Rectory of the Church. I will have an investigation upon the subject, and will thank you for any information you have upon it. If it is the Rectory, and he fulfills his duties as Rector, and as loyal citizen, that is all we can desire, and we should not disturb him. If it is not, then it must take the usual fate of Rebel property.
I return enclosed the papers you sent me. I am glad to see we are sustained, that our clergymen are sustained by our Bishop, Mr. Eastburn. As to the attacks of the World, I will tell you a secret. A year ago I offered to pay them a little something provided they did not stop abusing me, and they have diligently kept it up ever since; but I trust you and I have got thick skins to their abuse.

General: I have the honor to acknowledge the receipt of your communication of the 9th instant.
Before leaving the Pankatank on Monday last, I directed Act. Vol. Lt. Hooker, senior officer of the Rappahannock, to make a reconnoissance of this river as far as Urbana, on the following day. This reconnoissance was accordingly made and the shore communicated with, within sight of the enemy's pickets, information being gained thereby that there was then but a small rebel force on the peninsula between the York and Rappahannock rivers.
I have now directed Lieut. Hooker to comply with your request ""to watch the Rappahannock from ten (10) miles below Urbana to its mouth,"" until Tuesday morning next. The Pankatank being within the limits of my command, I will have it also properly guarded.
I desire, General, at all times to co-operate with you heartily in your enterprises, and with this view would respectfully suggest that whenever my co-operation can be of service to you, you inform me fully, at the earliest possible moment of your designs, so that I may the more effectually aid you in carrying them out.

"March 13, 1864","From T. Wentworth to General Butler
Lowell, March (13) 1864. Dear General: The time for choosing delegates to the National Convention is approaching and we ought to have a full understanding upon our mode of procedure. I have agreed with Mr. Dunham for an interview the present week in order to come to a conclusion upon the best mode of appointing the district delegates. There are two modes, one to elect the whole in a general convention, the other to choose all but two in the districts. When Chase was in the field we inclined to the choice by districts, under the idea that the Governor would be for Chase, and would exercise a potent influence in a general convention. Within a few days some people have been busy in circulating among members and others the idea that Gov. Andrew must be Vice President. I do not learn that he is privy to this. There is reason, I think, that he may be. He openly aspires to Wilson's place. Bullock's friends insist that he shall be a candidate in the next convention. What more likely than that the three would combine to place Andrew in the Vice President's chair? Such a combination would weaken us here, as we are counting on the speaker, who can hardly be expected to renounce his claims for the office of Governor, the object of all his desires. Besides this, he is politically timid, and would rather negotiate than fight.
Notwithstanding Mr. Chase's withdrawal would seem to leave Mr. Lincoln apparently alone in the field, it is evident
that there is a strong sentiment in favor of a more efficient man. I am ignorant of the secret movements at Washington, and thus situated look upon Gen. Grant's promotion as not unfavorable to you. He will be considered as the head of the Army, and his success then will indispose people to desire his removal from the field. If this sentiment for a more efficient man at the head of affairs should continue to increase, why may we not hope that the public attention will be turned towards you? Looking to that, we must do what we can to counteract this movement (if it shall prove to be a real one) in favor of Andrew. Some man must be selected for that office strong enough to rival Andrew, who I apprehend would be regarded with favor by a large portion of his party. We may fight him here under the colors of a Massachusetts candidate for the Presidency with success, but not otherwise.
I should like to hear from you in the course of the week if there is anything here deserving an answer. I shall probably be in Washington for a week or more in April, but shall not be absent from the convention. You are doubtless overrun with applications for commissions in the colored regiment. I infer so from the fact that I wrote you sometime since in favor of Charles Poor and another person, neither of whom have been so fortunate as to get a call from you. Poor is said to be an efficient officer; should you need one he would serve you with fidelity.
Can you realize that Capt. George is dead? Although I saw him in his coffin, and stood by when all was lowered into the narrow grave, yet I cannot persuade myself I shall see him no more. Save a slight compression of the lips there was no change after death, the full features and fresh color of life remained, and but for the surroundings one could almost imagine him alive. Judge Perkins gave me this account of his last attack. He rode out on Sunday morning with his wife, and on returning he complained of not feeling very well drank about a half a glass of brandy, and fel at once. He remained a day or two speechless, was unable to express his wants or to speak accurately to assent or dissent what was proposed to him. Towards the latter part of the week his physicians were anxious he should take brandy, but he refused, and consented to be fed with gin in small quantities. Saturday evening Mrs. Perkins persuaded him to take a little brandy, he consented and died in a half an hour. His friends did not consider him fully conscious at any time after he was
attacked, and so died Paul R. George. Neither of us have many such friends to lose.
Please present my regards to Mrs. Butler and Mrs. Heard.

I think it would be a good time to write Halleck and ask for troops, and give most of your time to getting in hand the troops that are in the department. You will make more capital just now to run the military strong than you will to spend your time arranging the civil office of that country.

It has become necessary to delay some days to find out the number of recruits in the regiment attempted to be raised by Captain Foster. As near as I can learn he has from three hundred to three hundred and twelve men, which would make four companies, and entitle him to be appointed Lieutenant Colonel. I found him here recruiting. He claimed that he had the power of nominating his own officers.
I knew nothing of his previous history, and supposing that he was a proper person to receive the commission, having been recommended by the General preceding me in command, and entrusted with the recruitment of the War Department, I nominated Foster as such Lt. Col., and gave him a provisional commission. I have since made all the more extended and necessary inquiries about him because of the paper referred to me and returned herein. In relation to him, from all I can learn, I think the interests of the service will not be promoted by his longer remaining in it. His movements in 'Sixty-one, the method which he took to get back into the service, his seeming want of efficiency, and his fickleness of purpose, render it not desirable that he should be retained in the service.

To the Consul of France at New Orleans
Mr. Consul: On the 20th of December last I had the honor to write to you, transmitting to you for the purpose of deposit a literal copy of two letters dated the 17th and 20th of the same month, addressed by me, the former to General Butler and the latter to General Banks, for the purpose of obtaining the restitution from Col. Stafford of thirty eight pieces of silverware which were seized in the hands of third parties, and which are my personal property.
My applications to those two Generals having been ineffectual, I had recourse to General Shepley, Military Governor of Louisiana, in his benevolent justice directing Colonel Stafford to make explanation in regard to my claim.
Paying defence to this order of his superior, Colonel Stafford alleged that he delivered the silverware to Mr. Field, the financial clerk of General Butler. This answer of the Colonel is shown in writing, the document which I have the honor to transmit to you herewith.
However this may be, and admitting that the declaration of Col. Stafford is true, it is none the less true that on the records of the Quartermaster which have been examined with
care, there is no mention and no trace of this silverware: from which the natural inference is that if it was really delivered by Colonel Stafford to Mr. Field, the latter must have carried it away with him when he left this city in December last in the train of General Butler. In this state of affairs, I have no longer any other resource than that of claiming the support of the French Government, under the protection of which I have already placed all my furniture, effects, documents, and movable value generally; and therefore I have the honor to request you, Mr. Consul, to be pleased to draw upon an official certificate of my reclamation, and to add it to those of a similar character which are prosecuted at this time against the American Government at Washington, which is civilly responsible for the acts and doings of its agents. In my preceding letter of the 20th of December last is an enumeration of the 38 pieces of silverware, with an estimate of their intrinsic value made on as moderate a basis as possible. In case this silverware cannot be restored to me in kind, I ask that its estimated value, say two hundred dollars, be paid to me, not in paper money but in hard cash, either in gold or silver. For with the frightful depreciation which all kind of paper currency is undergoing in this country, it would be impossible for me to replace this silverware by paying for it in paper currency of a like amount. Herewith you will find: 1st, the copy of my letter to General Shepley, Military Governor of Louisiana: 2nd, the original letter addressed by Gen. Shepley to Col. Stafford, on the back of which the allegations of Col. Stafford are written and signed with his own hand, and the other written and signed by Capt. Shepley, Secretary to the General and Governor.
Making, moreover, all reparations for the costs, expenses, and damages to which my reclamation may give rise, in order to repeat them, and to make the most of them, whensoever there may be occasion and against whomsoever it may concern.

"December 17, 1862","Enclosure
Translation. 204 St. Charles Street, New Orleans, December 17th, 1862
To Major General Butler, in the City
General: On the 9th of August, 1862, Mrs. Ferguson, furnished with a regular pass from Head Quarters, set out to rejoin her husband and children in the interior of Louisiana, whereat landing at the Stock Ferry Landing she was arrested by police officers, stationed there by your orders, and brought back to the city under the charge of smuggling. After undergoing an investigation. Mrs. Ferguson had her person and baggage searched, and the result of these searches was to show that among the effects of this lady were two bundles of newspapers consisting of New Orleans and New York journals, all circulating freely in the city and in Louisiana with your approbation, and one bundle of silverware and spoons, which three bundles had been confided to her by Mr. Gillis. One of these bundles of newspapers was addressed to Mr. John Gillis, a French citizen and a perfect foreign neutral, residing at Woodside, La. The other bundle of newspapers and the bundle containing the silverware and spoons were addressed to Mrs. M. Gillis, residing at that time at Bayou Goula, La., 35 miles below the city of Baton Rouge, which then formed the extreme limit of your military lines.
The pass of Mrs. Ferguson, it is true, stated that this lady could carry with her, her own apparel only, and the fact of her having in charge those 3 bundles which Mr. Gillis had confided to her subjected her to reproach, as constituting on her part the offence of smuggling. The truth is, General, that Mrs. Ferguson, not knowing in her womanly simplicity the real meaning or indeed even the existence of the restriction stated on her pass, and not conceiving, moreover, that the innocent contents of those three bundles could even be considered as articles contraband of War, had not even an idea that she was thus contravening the provisions of the iron code which is here called Martial Law. Mrs. Ferguson in vain protested her good faith and her inexperience: she was nevertheless
cast into prison to wait until she could be banished to Ship Island.
On the day after the arrest of Mrs. Ferguson, Mr. M. Gillis was ordered before you, and after some brief explanations, in the course of which he pleaded in vain his loyalty and good faith, he was held a prisoner at the Custom House, and three days afterwards he was banished to Ship Island without any other form of procedure.
Mr. Gillis was detained at Ship Island for 75 days, thus expiating [by] 82 days of actual captivity his simplicity in believing that the evidence of his good and loyal intentions might in strictness excuse the slight imprudence of which he had been guilty.
Mrs. Ferguson was set at liberty 3 or 4 days after her incarceration, and she was authorized to claim the effects of her personal property which had been seized at the moment of her arrest. Those effects, as well as the bundle of silverware and spoons destined for Mrs. M. Gillis, had been transferred from the Custom House to the house occupied by Col. Stafford on Canal Street.
Thither Mrs. Ferguson went to get back her effects, and there saw the bundle of silverware and spoons destined for Mrs. Gillis. The personal effects of Mrs. Ferguson were restored to that lady, but the bundle of silverware and spoons remained in the hands of Col. Stafford.
This bundle of silverware and spoons is my personal property, as will appear from the bill of sale and of lease, dated the 31st of December, 1860, and an instrument of which I produced the original and delivered a literal copy to Provost Marshal Kilburn, No. 177 Canal Street, on the occasion of an attempt made by that officer, in the month of September last, to seize the house which I occupy in this city, No. 204 St. Charles Street, and to expel me from the place by main force. I will add by the way that after a ten or twelve days of faithful discussion, during which I had to undergo unjustifiable molestations, Provost Marshal Kilburn, on seeing my voucher and other proofs which I exhibited to him, deemed it prudent to give up his project of seizing my house by main force and of expelling me from my house. This being said by the way, and returning to what forms the subject of my letter, I must admit to you, General, that it was through regard only and consideration for Mrs. M. Gillis that I lent to her husband this silverware, which however, was useless to me, in order that he might
place it at the disposal of his wife who wanted it. This will explain to you why and how this silverware, which is my personal property, should be in the hands of Mrs. Ferguson at this time of her arrest. After the arrest of Mrs. M. Gillis, I was waiting for a regular process in due form to be instituted against Mrs. Ferguson and Mr. M. Gillis, in order that I might myself intervene in the dispute and claim my property: for Bayou Goula being situated, as I before observed, this side of and within your lines, the sending of this bundle of silverware and spoons to Mrs. Gillis at that place no more constituted the offence of smuggling, were it looked at through a magnifying glass, than would the sending of the same bundle from my house to that of my neighbor.
That bundle circulated in the interior of the country occupied by you and subject to your jurisdiction, within the enceinte of even your lines, and consequently it is impossible to find in the particular case the slightest character of smuggling.
Mr. Gillis, having been released quite recently, and all ideas of regular and legal prosecution against him and against Mrs. Ferguson appearing to have been abandoned, and moreover learning to-day from your own official organ, the Delta, that you have resigned the command of the Department of the Gulf, I have the honor to write to you, General, in order to claim of your justice that you will be pleased to direct that bundle of silverware and spoons to me by Col. Stafford, or by any other person who may have them in his possession at this time.
I am confident, General, that my claim will be received by you, and that justice will be rendered to it in a short time, and while the officers of your administration and Staff have not yet left the city, which will enable you to see the matter in a clear light. I venture even to believe that you will be pleased with me for thus furnishing you with an opportunity to repair an injustice, or at least to correct a serious irregularity, the responsibility for which will weigh fatally on the persons of whom your Head Quarters consist.
Deign to honor me with an answer. I have the honor to be with respect, General, your very humble and obedient servant,
A. Villeneuve, French Citizen

Translation. New Orleans, December 20th, 1862
To Major General Banks, Commander in Chief of the Department of the Gulf
General: I have the honor to transmit to you herewith a literal copy of a letter which I addressed on the 17th instant to Major General Butler, claiming the restoration of 38 pieces of silverware (silverware and spoons) which are my personal property, and which in consequence of seizure in third hands have been since the month of August last in possession of Col. Stafford of the (Native Guards). General Butler having declined to give effect to my request, I make application to you, General, soliciting from your justice the restitution to which I am entitled.
The high reputation for integrity and honor which has already preceded you in this city is to me a sure guaranty that you will deign to receive my reclamation, and give the necessary orders with a view that justice may be done to it.
My letter to General Butler, of which I transmit you a copy, contains a succinct and correct summary of the circumstances of the case, and the mere perusal thereof will certainly and entirely convince you in regard to the subject. In case, General, you should deem it proper to have an investigation made, it is desireable that such investigation should take place within a brief time, and especially before the officers of the administration of Gen. Butler put on trial shall have left New Orleans, their presence here being indispensable for the elucidation of the question.
Mrs. S. G. Ferguson, who was deprived of her buggy and horses at the same time that I was of my silverware, and to whom Col. Stafford has promised that they should be restored to her, but always in vain, proposes also in her distress to make appeal to your benevolent justice, in order to obtain the reparation which is due to her.
I have the honor to be, General, with the most profound respect your very humble and very obedient servant,

His Excellency General Shepley, Military Governor of Louisiana
General: On the 9th of August, 1863, Mrs. S. G. Ferguson provided with a regular pass from the Headquarters was leaving the city to meet her husband and children in the country, when she was arrested on her way up and brought back here under the charge of smuggling.
Mrs. Ferguson was searched as well as her baggage, and the result was that among her personal effects, were found two bundles of newspapers and another bundle of silverware, this last directed to Mrs. M. Gillis, of this city living then at Bayou Goula, Louisiana, thirty-five miles below Baton Rouge, which was the extreme limit of Gen. Butler's military lines. Those three bundles had been remitted to her by M. Gillis, Esq., of this city.
After three days of imprisonment Mrs. Ferguson was released, and allowed to claim the baggage which together with the bundle of silverware had been carried away from the Head Quarters to Col. Stafford's house on Canal Street.
On leaving that place, where she had been confined, Mrs. Ferguson took with her her personal apparel only.
But her buggy and horses and also the bundle of silverware were retained by Col. Stafford, and have not so far been accounted for. That bundle of silverware belongs to the undersigned, Adolph Villeneuve, French Subject, who lent it to M. Gillis to be put by the latter at the disposal of his wife who was in want of such things.
But Mrs. Ferguson having been released with no trial at all, and M. Gillis likewise some time since, moreover as any idea of a judicial prosecution against both of them seems to be given up, I have the honor to call to your Excellency and solicit of your justice, to order that said bundle of silverware be returned to me without any further delay by Colonel Stafford, or any other person who may be at present the holder of it. With this hope, General, I have the honor to be, of your Excellency, the most humble and obedient servant,

"March 12, 1864","Headquarters, Department of Va. and N. C., Fort Monroe, March 12th, 1864
Hon. E. M. Stanton, Secretary of War, Washington, D. C.
Sir: I have the honor to acknowledge the receipt of certain papers referred to me by your order the twenty-third of February last past, in regard to a lot of silverware said to belong to Mr. A. Villeneuve, an alleged French subject residing in New Orleans, which was seized in that city by order of Federal Officers, and have the honor to report thereon.
There are two classes of papers in this reference. One, a complaint by Mr. Villeneuve, through the French Minister, for the detention of his property as alleged; and the other the Report of the present Commanding General of the Gulf and his subordinate as to the whereabouts of that property.
The natural order of the consideration of these subjects will be to take the last first, because, if the property cannot be found, and if, as is alleged in the report of that officer, it still remained in the hands of my financial agent, I am responsible for it; and therefore should be under great inducement to make a case against M. Villeneuve in order not to be called to an account for the property. But if the property is still in the hands of the present Commander of the Dept. of the Gulf, then I shall stand as a disinterested witness on behalf of the United States, and the facts and circumstances that I report will be entitled to the credit due to such witness.
I have more than a common interest in the first branch of this inquiry, because this is not the first time I have been called upon, as well in public prints as by official papers, to account
for the articles of property of great value which were left by me for the benefit of the United States (with those) who were sent by the War Department of the United States to relieve me in the command of the Dept. of the Gulf. A notable instance of this sort of accusation was an attack made in the Senate of the United States by Senator Davis of Kentucky, alleging that I had retained for my own use, and embezzled for my own benefit, the silverplate of Alexander Brother, a rebel of La., who forfeited both plate and life to an injured Government, and both should have been taken away, when at the same time I held the receipt of the proper accounting officer of that Dept. under Gen. Banks for the property, which it was alleged I had taken away. And again in this case, this plate of M. Villeneuve, which John W. McClure, Capt. and Asst. Quartermaster, has endorsed upon the report was never in his possession, was in fact on or about the 21st of December, 1862 returned over to him by my Financial Agent, David C. G. Field, Esq., and McClure's receipt as Quartermaster taken therefor by order of Gen. Banks, which receipt I now have; so that if McClure has not accounted to the proper officer for that plate, it is because he has embezzled the same, and I desire and respectfully but earnestly demand that the matter may be investigated by the proper officers.
I beg leave upon this matter to enclose the sworn report of my Financial Agent, D. C. G. Field, as part of the evidence submitted. Having now ascertained where the silverplate in question is, or at least which of the officers of the United States is responsible therefor, either to the United States or to the claimant, I have the honor to report upon the second branch of the subject, whether the plate in question ought to be given up to M. Villeneuve.
When in New Orleans I had examined this question with care upon complaint made to me, and determined upon the evidence that the plate was liable to confiscation, and had then, and have now, no doubt of the propriety of the decision.
The facts are briefly these: A Mrs. Ferguson had called upon the proper officer of the Department for a pass to go through the lines of the Union Army. It was granted, upon the express condition appearing upon the face of the pass, and explained to her, that she should take with her nothing but the ordinary articles of wearing apparel for a woman.
M. Villeneuve, who, although probably born a Frenchman, has about the same claim to protection from the French
Government that Lafitte the pirate had, resided at this time within the rebel lines, and was acting with them. Some of his property when he fled from New Orleans was left there, among which was the silverplate in question, and probably left in this Mrs. Ferguson's care, for when she attempted to pass our picket this silverplate was found concealed in the bottom of her buggy in which she was traveling.
She was taken before the Provost Marshal, and after a full hearing she was convicted of the attempt to smuggle it, and the property was forfeited, and ought long since to have been sold and the proceeds appropriated to the use of the United States, which certainly would have been done under a proper administration in the Department of the Gulf.
To the allegation of M. Villeneuve that this woman was simple, and therefore undertook to carry away his plate, a single observation may be made. She was a strong-minded, high-cheek-boned, and rather brazen-faced Scotch woman, who had every other attribute that might belong to a woman rather than simplicity; and the only exhibition of weakness of intellect which she showed was in entertaining the idea that she could pass the pickets with her plunder without being caught.
These facts and circumstances are very fresh in my mind, because I had very considerable trouble with the woman, for this plate was not the only property which she had.
Trusting that such investigation will be made as will require this property either to be paid to the United States, where it ought to go, or be given to M. Villeneuve, where it ought not to go, and that it may not be kept by McClure, who has still less right to it, I have the honor to be, very respectfully.
Your obedient servant, B. F. Butler, Maj. Gen. Commdg."

Dear Parker: When I was in New Orleans, Stafford took from a Mrs. Ferguson thirty eight pieces of silver plate, forks, spoons, &c., which were by Field turned over to Mr. McClure, the Quartermaster.
McClure has reported to the War Department that he has not got them. I have his receipt for them. I believe that the same silver is doing duty on Banks' table to-day. I wish you would quietly have a careful examination made, and if that turns out to be true let me know. I suppose the plate is marked, but do not know what the mark is. Of course you will not say anything about this to anybody, but take such measures as to make sure that it is there. I think the plate is not marked in Villeneuve's name, but in some other person's name (say Gillis). Write me as soon as you can learn anything about it. I have the honor to be,

I have seen McClure, who now says the Villeneuve silverware ""has been in his possession,"" and that he sold it and accounted for it in his ""abstract."" He says that he made his endorsement owing to its having been marked ""Gillis"" instead of ""Villeneuve."" The Twiggs' plate, so he says, has been sold for ""pure silver.""
Many of your old officers here expressed a desire to be transferred to your Department.
It is stated here that Dudley, staff, and his command, ran at the first fire in the late action, Lee and Dudley have both been relieved, and are in town.
There is nothing from Red River for several days. At last accounts Banks was getting back to Alexandria. The whole thing seems to have fallen through.
You can hardly have an idea of the intense feeling for your return here, that is prevalent in New Orleans. Your reception would be such a one as must be highly gratifying to you.

My dear Madam: I am truly sorry that any Union officer of mine has attempted to fritter away the effect of the Oath of
Allegiance to the Government of the United States, and to inform you that it means nothing more than passive obedience to the same. That officer is surely mistaken. The Oath of Allegiance means fealty, pledge of faith of love, affection, and reverence for the Government, all comprised in the word Patriotism, in its highest and truest sense, which every true American feels for his or her Government.
You say, ""I cannot understand how a woman can support, protect, and defend the Union except by speaking or writing in favor of the present war, which I could never do because my sympathies are with the South.""
That last phrase, Madam, shows why you cannot understand how ""a woman can support, protect and defend the Union."" Were you loyal at heart, you would at once understand.
The Southern women, who are rebels, understand well ""how to support, protect, and defend the Confederacy, without either speaking or writing."" Some of them act as spies, some smuggle quinine in their underclothes, some smuggle information through their dresses, some tend sick soldiers for the Confederacy, some get up subscriptions for rebel gunboats. Perhaps it may all be comprised in the phrase, ""Where there is a will there is a way.""
Now then, you could support, protect, and defend the Union by teaching the scholars of your school the love and reverence of the Government, to be proud of their country, to glory in its flag, and to be true to its Constitution. But as you don't understand that yourself, you can't teach it to them, and therefore I am glad to learn from your letter that your school has been closed since Christmas, and with my consent, until you change your sentiments and are a loyal woman in heart, it never shall be opened.
I would advise you, madam, forthwith to go where your ""sympathies"" are. I am only doubtful whether it is not my duty to send you. I have the honor to be, very respectfully,

Moreover my men are to fight with ropes around their necks; and if my commission dates back, as I have requested, I shall have more opportunity to protect them from ignominy, since I shall run less risk of being brigaded under young officers who will neglect to take into consideration the exceptional position of my men. They will of course look upon me as a friend and protector, and it is right that I should stipulate for such rank as would give me a chance to do all that a Colonel could do for their welfare. I take the liberty to state furthermore that I was brigaded under Gen. King about the middle of August, 1861, at the time my regiment reported for duty at Washington; that I remained in his brigade for about ten days, when my regiment was transferred to the brigade of Gen. Richardson, where it remained for about three weeks; and that my regiment was assigned on the 14th day of September,
1861, to artillery duty under my own command, and was never, from that day forward, brigaded under any person other than myself until my resignation as Colonel of the Mass. 14th was accepted, which was at some time in the month of October, 1862, or a little more than a year subsequent to the date of the assignment of the regiment to artillery duty. I take the liberty to state further that I was twice placed in command of a brigade composed of several regiments (my own regiment was one of three battalions of 600 men each), and on neither of these occasions by mere accident or to fill a temporary vacancy, since on each occasion, the brigade was created by the order which placed me in command of it. I have reason to believe that the second of the brigades here mentioned is still in existence.
2nd That my men shall not be exposed, unnecessarily, in the performance of such outpost duty as would render them liable to be taken and hanged in squads of eight or ten, but that the regiment shall have the opportunity to so fight that the men may defend each other, and die, if they must die, of wounds made by projectiles and cutting implements mentioned in the ordinance Manual, and not by the rope, and at the hands of the rebel Provost Marshals, and I respectfully request that such guaranties may be given in this respect as may be consistent with the interests of the service and custom of armies, and such also as may be considered sufficient and satisfactory by Major General Butler. Of course I do not request that any contract of this nature should be made with the men; for soldiers who make terms in their enlistment papers are worse than useless, and fit only to be disbanded. I should also consider it indelicate on my part to ask that any terms should be made with me. I therefore respectfully request that this matter may be arranged in a manner satisfactory to Major General Butler.
3rd. That I shall have an opportunity to examine the officers of the regiment with the liberty to object to such of them as I deem inefficient or incompetent, Major General Butler to take such action on my report as he may deem just, proper, and for the interest of the service; also that I shall have such authority in disciplining my regiment as is guaranteed to me by the articles of war and by the acts of Congress.
I would respectfully recommend that the regiment should be organized as a regiment of two battalions, with authority to add a third -- and, if possible a fourth -- battalion, as soon
as transfugees to the requisite number have been obtained. After my old regiment was assigned to artillery duty, I was authorized to enlist two new companies, and to organize the whole into three battalions of four companies each -- each company to consist (if I remember rightly) of 151 enlisted men: all of which I accomplished without any difficulty. I suppose we can, if this plan pleases you, get good terms from the War Department, and obtain permission to organize battalions as fast as we can have the requisite number of companies, each company being filled to the minimum standard only. It would then be the duty of the Captains, and also their interest, to enlist up to the maximum standard as soon as circumstances might permit. I think the minimum standard is eighty-three enlisted men, and that eight companies must be organized before the Colonel can be mustered in, but am not sure of these figures as I have no present means of verifying them. A captain and two lieutenants suffice for a company of 83 enlisted men; but five company officers and several additional sergeants and corporals are none too many for a company of 150 enlisted men.
I take the liberty to suggest, also, that although military knowledge is always necessary to a military man, good business habits and familiarity with affairs are even more requisite to a Lieutenant Colonel of a regiment of several battalions than information strictly military. There is, I apprehend, no place in the line for the Lieut. Colonel of a regiment of several battalions; and his function is, if I am not mistaken, to replace the Colonel in the case of death or absence of the latter, or, in case of the Colonel's presence with the regiment, to render all possible assistance in attending to the accounts and to the incidental business of the regiment. The Lieut. Colonel has, usually, time to prepare himself by observation and experience, and by watching the movement of things, to replace the Colonel in command. The Majors, or battalion commanders ought to be competent military men, and either already conversant with the battalion and brigade drill, or capable of soon becoming so by study.
I would, respectfully suggest that the quarter-master and commissary officer of a regiment ought always to be possessed of considerable capacity, and especially so when the regiment is one of several battalions; also that in the case of this particular regiment the captains should be good judges of human nature, since we shall probably find, in each company, some
very bad men, of criminal intentions, who are insincere in their present allegiance, and some men also, who were forced into the rebel army, and are unfit by natural temperament to serve under any colors. It comes to my mind the more naturally to think there may be men in the regt. capable of firing on their officers as soon as the first battle shall have commenced, inasmuch as I once had a gun snapped on me (in Florida) by a man who had been a pirate, and had been convicted as such and pardoned. If there are any such men in the regt., the Captains ought to know how to weed them out, and get them put to work with ball and chain before we go into action.
I apologize to the General for the length of this letter, but I do not know how I could make it shorter. The General will please notice that I put no absolute conditions to my acceptance of the commission except those which are guaranteed to me by the laws of Congress, the invariable custom of armies, and the articles of war, and also the one, special to this particular case, that my commission shall date from the fifth of July, 1861.
You are aware, General, that I have no politics, that I was originally a democrat, that I became a radical anti-slavery man when the fugitive slave-law was passed, and that my democratic and anti-slavery principles have prevented me, for many years past, from voting, and that I shall probably refrain from principle from voting hereafter, so long as slavery is, in any way whatever, guaranteed by the Constitution of the United States. I think my political record is, if not wise and judicious, at least consistent. Nevertheless I am a subject of the United States, the United States is endeavoring to put down an inexcusable rebellion, the Government of the United States is (with all its faults) the best in the world, and my allegiance is due to that Government. I would not, on any consideration, at the present time, after the experience I have had, volunteer my services; but if my services as a soldier are asked for, I do not feel at liberty to decline serving my country in a military capacity. Nevertheless, General, if anything happens to prevent me from receiving the commission, it will be a matter of rejoicing to me, since I have little to gain and much to lose by re-entering the service. I have bought me a house, with several acres of land around it, am engaged in superintending the education of my children, am now favored by Providence beyond the ordinary lot of men, am happy and contented, and shall be grateful to the
country if it will leave me where I am. In the matter of accepting the commission, I will do my absolute duty, and nothing more. I had rather not have it than have it.
But, General, whatever may be the result, I shall always feel grateful for your kindness in remembering me, and in recognizing, as I have always recognized, our friendship of so many years standing. There are many reasons now existing why I should not have considered it my duty -- reasons which it is not necessary to state -- to accept a commission as Colonel, if that commission had been offered me by any person, now serving in the field, other than yourself. I have the honor to remain, General, Very respectfully,
Your obliged friend and servant,
Wm. B. Greene"

The following intelligence received from scouts just returned, is sent for your information:
The enemy are making large preparations for the capture of Norfolk; large details are made from Pickett's division to work on the gunboats now building at Richmond. The work is pushed night and day, and it is expected three (3) gunboats will be finished in three (3) or (4) weeks. They are also building floats or rafts to carry guns to move down the James River with their fleet. Longstreet is to have command on the Blackwater for the main attack on Norfolk. His whole command is expected at Petersburg. His force is estimated at fifteen thousand (15,000). Pontoons have been sent from Richmond to Petersburg. A feint will be made on Williamsburg with a force of three thousand (3,000) infantry, and some cavalry and artillery, and for this purpose, Ford's bridge over the Chickahominy is being rebuilt. The whole information is brought by a man named Lehman, whom our scouts brought back with them, and who represents himself as having been sent by Union men in Richmond to communicate the above, and other information to the War Department. He will be sent up to-morrow with an officer. Our scouts report that J. E. B. Stuart is collecting a cavalry force at Fredericksburg to make raid on our rear, and is only waiting for the Rappahannock to become fordable to cross at or near Fredericksburg. They also report the enemy sending supplies and ammunition in great quantities over both railroads, uniting at Hanover Junction to Lee's army.

Dear General: I cannot forget you, and verily I believe there are many more in the Gulf Department who have not forgotten you, and like unto myself would like to see you in the occupancy of a much higher position than the one you now occupy. I am in receipt of letters from friends in the West, from time to time, and am fully satisfied that the tone of public feeling is assuming a form that to me looks like a certainty for your nomination. There is much of the conservative element in the western states, that element may be regarded as in the majority; had it not been so, Mr. Lincoln could not have received the nomination in 1860. Now, Mr. Chase is too much of a Radical. Mr. Lincoln is not conservative enough, and neither is believed to understand the mode of dealing with the rebellious so well as yourself. This feeling has fired the entire West, and no man can get the nomination
for President who has not come up to your standard of judgment in this matter.
I am informed that it is believed that Mr. Chase is too smart to allow his name to be pressed in convention, but will advise his friends at just the right time to give their influence to you; this opinion is based upon the known intimacy between yourself and that distinguished gentleman. Now should this prove correct your nomination may be regarded as certain.

I am in receipt of your letter in regard to the money alleged to be of Samuel Smith & Co., bankers at New Orleans, up to the time of the capture of that city by the United States forces.
As you are aware, I am in the field and have therefore no books or papers with me relating to former transactions, and was obliged to wait until I had examined some memoranda before I could make as full an answer as I could wish. This must be my apology for the delay in replying to your letter.
I am now without dates and amounts, but the facts and the order of sequence I am quite sure will be without mistake. The case of Smith and Co. was as follows: Within a few days after my arrival in New Orleans, I received information that the Director of the U. S. Mint, upon the appearance of the U. S. Fleet, had fled up the Red River with Governor T. O. Moore and a portion of specie of mint and of some of New Orleans banks.
That he had deposited with Samuel Smith & Co., Bankers, whose place of business was next door to the Canal Bank and banking house $50,000 of the specie which belonged to the United States. Upon further examination, it appeared that the Mint Director, finding the silver too bulky to carry away, had placed a large sum to the Samuel Smith & Co., who had loaned it, or a portion of it, to the Canal Bank, which, during some days just before the taking of the city of New Orleans, had been redeeming its circulation in specie. That this silver had been paid out by the bank to its customers and bill-holders.
That Samuel Smith and Co. had received for this specie fifty thousand dollars in gold, in two sums from the director of the Bank, which, being simply the exchange of the money of the United States, was of course the property of the United States, Smith and Co., having this idea in concealing the stolen specie of the United States.
Whereupon I caused Samuel Smith to be brought before me for examination, and in the most solemn manner he denied as well the exchange of the silver as the possession of the gold or
silver: knew not where there was any concealed or conveyed away; averred that his books would show that he had no gold of any amount. I caused his books and papers to be seized and examined. Finding upon his books which had been altered and erased for the occasion that his firm had a quantity of gold, although by no means the amount of $50,000 dollars, and feeling sure of my information, I ordered Smith to be sent to Fort Jackson. Smith thereupon confessed that the whole story heretofore told me had been a lie, and that he had locked up in the air space between his safe and the brick wall of his counting house a large amount of gold and silver. Upon sending there, we found the two kegs of $25,000 each we were in search of, and some bags of gold and silver amounting to some 14 to $17,000 more, some of which corresponded with some of the entries on Smith and Co.'s books. I thereupon seized the specie and held it for the use of the Government.
Afterwards, Mr. Jacob Barker applied to me for a hearing upon the question of property, and whether there was a probable cause for holding this gold as the property of the United States, and I appointed a commission consisting of Gen. Shepley, Military Governor, Dr. Mercer, President of the Bank of Louisiana, and Thomas J. Durant (I believe), an eminent lawyer of New Orleans, to adjudicate and determine these questions. A full hearing was had, witnesses were examined, books produced and examined, and counsel heard in argument. I remember the President of the Canal Bank was examined and made a very lame explanation of how Mr. Smith got this money out of his bank, and of the way he borrowed the silver of the mint. Smith's brother was also examined, who gave a still more lame account of the alteration of the books, and why there appeared in the cash account about that time so many thousand dollars worth of ""Lead,"" and on the next page so many thousand dollars worth of ""Tin."" Suffice it to say, that after a laborious examination the Board reported that the 14 or 17000 dollars of specie was the property of Smith & Co., and should be given up to them, and that there was cause for holding the two kegs of $25,000 each.
This report with the accompanying documents was thereupon forwarded to the Treasury Department at Washington; all the smaller sums of $14000 or so and papers returned immediately to Smith & Co., with the exception of about 1300 dollars about which a dispute arose between Smith & Co. and my officers, they averring that they had never received the amount,
and Smith claimed that they had. Afterwards, before I left New Orleans, in order that there might be no just cause to suspect the integrity of my officers, I paid Mr. Baker, Smith's counsel, the sum in the dispute and took his receipt. In the meantime my troops had remained unpaid, some for more than six months, and although repeated requisitions had been made on the Treasury still the money had not been transmitted.
Believing that this money belonged to the United States, as I now believe, and there being no difference at that date between gold and silver and Treasury notes in New Orleans, and but little anywhere, for reasons stated in my reports to the Treasury I turned over this gold from time to time to my Pay Masters, to be paid out to the troops, and it was so done, and when afterwards they got funds they repaid me, and indeed I believe it was advanced to them and returned more than once.
The reasons why probably you cannot find that gold, ""eo nomine"" [in] the accounts of Major Hewitt and Usher, was that no difference was made in paying the troops between that and Treasury notes, and therefore receiving it and returning it when they had funds there would be no appearance of it. You will find therefor in my accounts settled at the War Office that I have charged myself with that amount of $50,000, and made myself responsible to the Government for it in a final settlement of my account, taking care that any supposed rights of Smith & Co. should be preserved by a written statement filed with the accounts in the War Office as well as my report to the Treasury. In the usual case of a disputed claim I should hardly have felt myself called upon to answer to the counsel of one party, to have given so full a statement of facts, but having taken this money as an executive officer of the Government, I have felt it my duty to make full expositions of all the facts so far as they have come to my knowledge and are now within my recollection.
I may, however, be permitted to add a single fact, which will perhaps be no information to their counsel, that the two brothers Smith & Co. were both bitter, active, and unrelenting Rebels, who refused to take the oath of allegiance so long as I remained in New Orleans, and one or both I believe went to Canada to evade it.
If you should desire any other questions answered in this regard, you have only to propose them, and if you will give me opportunity to go to books and papers, I have no doubt but I
can give you sums and dates. I have the honor to be, very respectfully,

"March 22, 1864","Enclosure referred to in Foregoing Letter
Fortress Monroe, Va., March 22nd, 1864
General: I was a passenger on board the U. S. transport ""Mississippi"" on her last voyage from New Orleans, La., to New York City. The 30th Mass. Vols., Major H. O. Whittimore Commanding, having re-enlisted as veterans, were coming home on 30 days furlough, and also on board.
I was astonished to hear Maj. W. say that he would not obey the command of an officer of a negro regiment who by date of Commission or otherwise might rank him; he would resign first. That no man who would accept the commission in a negro regiment was his superior, and therefore that any man who does accept such position was unfit to command him. He said that no man now commanding negro troops was his equal as a soldier, and I am not sure that he did not add ""or otherwise."" I asked him if he had ever seen the officers of the 54th Mass. Vols., especially the late Col. Shaw. He replied in a sneering manner that he knew Col. Shaw, that he was no soldier, and, when alive occupied an unenviable social position.
He said the law is and ought to be that officers commanding negro troops take rank next after officers of like grade commanding white troops, irrespective of date of commissions -- urging as a reason his former statement that only inferior men, ambitious for commands, and unable to procure white men, would command and lead only negro troops. These are specimens of very much that he said during an hour or two that we were discussing the subject. He said, however, that he was ""in favor of negro troops.""
At Key West, some colored troops came on board our vessel with transportation (steerage passage) furnished by the U. S. Quartermaster at that place. The purser said that by order of the Q. M. they were entitled to such berths between
decks as were provided for private soldiers. But Maj. W. being the ranking officer and so in command of the ship, compelled them to lie out on deck -- their arms, accoutrements, &c., exposed to the weather, when there were plenty of berths below and unoccupied, as the Major was informed by the Purser at the time; and this when the negroes, approaching a Northern climate in the winter, needed the best protection, and when the line officers of the Major's Regt. told me the negroes were then neater and more orderly soldiers than their own.
Major W. told me he expected to be made Lt. Col. of the Regt. before it returns to the field.
Now he is my personal friend for aught I know, I certainly am his -- but it has occurred to me that men of his opinions about negro troops ought not to be sent up higher just at this time. Such men certainly misrepresent Massachusetts. I am of the opinion that if these facts reach Gov. Andrew the promotion will not be made.
During my intercourse with them I learned that the line officer preferred that one Capt. Wells, whom I never saw and do not know, should be promoted over him. Capt. S. Kennedy, commanding steamship ""Mississippi,"" and Jno. Bogart, Esq., father of Major Bogart (162 N. Y. Vols.), who fell at Port Hudson, and some other officers heard the discussions alluded to.
You are at liberty to make any use you choose of this statement, and it can be verified by several gentlemen if necessary. I have the honor to be very respectfully,

Hon. John F. Dent, Annapolis, Md.
Sir: Your communication enclosing letters from your wife and daughter, as to the taking away of your slaves, was received, and an examination made into the matter, the papers of which I herewith forward to you.
From them it will appear, First, that no party, male or female, was taken away from your place against their will. Second, that negroes were enlisted in the United States service, and their families allowed to come with them. For one, I could not consent to take the husband and father to fight for the United States and leave his wife and child in slavery, and whenever the Government requires that of me, they will have to get some other gentleman to do that business. Besides, it would be manifestly unjust to you to take away the valuable servants for the benefit of the United States, and to leave you to support their women and children, and therefore I have ordered in every case where the wife and children choose to come with the husband and father when he enlists, that they should be received, and taken care of at the expense of the United States.
We pay no state aid, or bounties, for the enlistment of these
men, and it would seem to be just that the pittance which is required for the support of their families should be given them, and that while in our ranks the soldier should at least know where his family is, and that it is safe within the protection of that Government under whose flag he is enrolled.
Again, it will appear that my recruiting officer did not refuse to give his name. If he had done so, it would have been directly in disobedience to the most positive orders.
I can easily understand and sympathize with the trouble and discomfort the loss of servants occasions in a household, especially under such a system of labor as has been heretofore enforced in Maryland. But you, as a loyal man, will feel the necessity of submitting to that, as all of us have to submit to many discomforts, annoyances, grievances, and troubles, because of this unhappy War.

Dahlgren's body, for reasons which I believe are not within the control of the Confederate officers. I trust at least matters are so far arranged that if we do not go on with the exchange upon

Dear Butler: Capt. Barlow will probably be at Fortress Monroe with the ""Relief"" the last of this or first of next week. He will tell you exactly what she is, & I believe she will prove in every respect as good as any propeller of her size. I know she will unless she fails in speed, which I do not expect. I shall be disappointed if she does not prove a sure eight knot boat. She will go anywhere inside or outside where her draft of water will allow. She will tow, if necessary. She can carry five hundred troops, I think -- has an awning, & seems to me to be just the boat you want for universal use.
I suppose Sarah read to you my letter about George's will. Mrs. George claims an absolute title to all the property, real & personal, independent of all legacies, unless she dies within a year of his death. John H. claims that it is only a life estate (she) will hold. I think her claim is most in accordance with the language of the will, even as to the legacies, & it seems to me the will cannot be reconciled at all with the idea that she takes only a life estate.
Night before last, for the first time in my life, I saw & heard Wendell Phillips. He excoriated Banks, opposes Lincoln for his imbecility, for being an honest incompetent, goes for you & Fremont, but pretty much all for you. For instance, he illustrated Lincoln in contrast to you -- ""Lincoln drifts, Butler steers; pilots don't drift, they steer. Five years ago I thought Lincoln a better man than Butler, but when this war broke out, Butler's New England mind burst the trammels of party, & comprehended this whole great question. To meet it, Lincoln, born in the South & for thirty years living in the South, had his Southern prejudices & feelings, & wants to treat the Southerners kindly & tenderly, & issues his amnesty proclamations for the white oligarchists, & says to the negro, ‘Haven't I done a great deal for you?’ Oh, yes; & so he drifts along with amnesty & emancipation proclamations. Butler sees a man drowning, seizes him by the hair of the head & places him high and dry on land; Lincoln takes hold of him, carries him to low water mark, lays him down in the mud & surf, & says to him, ‘There, I have done a great deal for you, struggle for the next twenty years; I hope you will get ashore.’"" He is clearly for you against all competitors, but
would support Fremont -- is bitter against Banks, & considers Lincoln wholly unfit for want of capacity.

Dear Madam: I send you a slip from the Morning Chronicle of March 23, which you may not have seen. I explain it thus.
Gen. B. is more dreaded as a Presidential candidate than any one spoken of. I do not think that the President is on this account disposed to underrate or circumscribe the Gen. so much as portions of his Cabinet. The uneasy spirit is the
Sec. of War. He to my knowledge has been always depreciating where he might venture.
The Pres. to a very particular friend of mine a week or ten days ago spoke of Gen. B. in connection with the Presidency, showing his fears, and wishing that friend evidently to sound me. I told that Congressional friend that Gen. B. was no aspirant for the Presidency, that he was intent unselfishly on one great object, the utter suppression of the rebellion and its main cause, that he and his good lady were devoting themselves to this one work, that he was not in the President's way, that the President ought to be his friend, and that Gen. B. ought to have a larger command and field for his talents, etc., that he ought to seek Gen.

Major Genl. B. F. Butler, Hd. Qrs. Ft. Monroe
Sir: We have seen an order from your department requiring the churches in Norfolk & Portsmouth to be occupied only by ministers of known loyalty to the Government. We approve such order very much, and would like to have the same obtained in the Counties of Accomack and Northampton, Va. We do not think the military generally are good judges in spiritual affairs, or that they should undertake to control the churches under ordinary circumstances, but when the ministry have prostituted their calling to purposes of disloyalty, and have turned the house of God into a conventicle
of treason, we do suppose the Military may properly interfere, especially where the nation is in a serious throe for her existence.
Ordinarily we have had in this region Protestant Episcopals, Presbyterians, Baptists, and Methodist Episcopals, but at this time we have no Presbyterian Minister on the E. S. Va. The Protestant Episcopals have one minister in each County, and, so far as we are advised, they are both prudent in their conduct, and zealous for the Spiritual welfare of their flocks. The Baptists have several churches and more ministers who are, with one exception, raging secessionists, busy-bodies going from place to place, and supplying and propagating all kinds of sermons adverse to our country's cause. We have three or four of these ""men of God"" in and around this village who have all swallowed the oath under number 49. One of them has charge of a female college, where we think more mischief has been concocted in the way of blockade running, and general and special disloyalty, than in any other place of equal dimensions within our region.
The Methodist Episcopals we are more familiar with, and would like to draw your attention more particularly to them. From 1787 to 1844 the Methodists of the entire peninsula were under control of the Philadelphia Conference, and no ministry gave more satisfaction to their people than these up to that time, -- then came the division of the church and the inauguration of the M. E. Church S. Nearly all in Accomack stood firm in their adhesion to Phila. Conference, and so did a part of Northampton, but politicians took side with the church S., and stimulated the ignorant rabble to acts of violence. In Northampton the war began by the assembling of rioters at a place called Salem's, and dragging from the pulpit the Rev. M. Gray of the Philadelphia Conference, and so from place to place they were driven, till all ""the abolitionists,"" as they were styled, had been banished from the Co., and the places filled by ""good Southerners."" The same wild spirit of persecution followed us in Accomack, but it was more successfully met here, and the church organization was preserved, though several churches were violently wrested from us. And so we continued to keep them at bay till 1860, when party spirit rose so high that it was positively dangerous to receive a minister from the Conference of our choice. We then for the present assumed a middle attitude, and obtained a minister from Baltimore, but he proved to be a rank Secessionist,
and from his political conduct brought us into many troubles. Now we are comparatively a small party, but we have thought best to renew our allegiance to the old Conference, and they have appointed us a minister whom we expect in a few days. We are assured the minister to come is of unquestionable loyalty, though no politician, and doubtless he will be very acceptable to us, and unacceptable to all those who require a partisan preacher. Of course so long as Secession preachers are allowed to occupy churches of any denomination, ours will have but small congregations. We think if they were not so allowed, a great opportunity to mislead the ignorant and keep up the strife would be taken away, and the people would have time to reflect more for themselves, and thus a great step would be taken towards restoring the church to her proper status, and benefiting the State at the same time.
We have taken the liberty, sir, to make those hurried suggestions, hoping you will not deem it improper meddling, and trusting the object indicated may agree with your own sense of propriety. We would have preferred a personal interview in this relation, but have not at present an opportunity. Very Respectfully,

SURROGATE'S COURT, COUNTY OF NEW YORK
Account of Proceedings. In the matter of the accounting of Benjamin F. Butler as the Executor of the last Will and Testament of Andrew J. Butler, deceased.
To the Surrogate of the County of New York
I, Benjamin F. Butler of Lowell, in the State of Massachusetts, do render the following account of my proceedings as Executor of Andrew J. Butler, deceased, for final settlement and allowance:
On the fourteenth day of November, 1864, letters testamentary of the last Will and Testament of Andrew J. Butler, late of the City of New York deceased, were issued to me. On the twenty-third day of August, 1865, I caused an inventory of the personal estate of the deceased to be filed in this office, which personal estate therein sets forth amounts by appraisement by the appraiser duly appointed to seventy-six thousand three hundred and ninety-one dollars and four cents ($76,391.04).
Schedule A, hereto annexed, contains a statement of all the property contained in said inventory, sold by me at public or private sale, with the price and manner of sale, which sales were fairly made by me at the best prices that could then be had with due diligence, as I then believed. It also contains a statement of all the debts due the said estate and mentioned in the said inventory, which have been collected, and also of all interest for moneys received by me for which I am legally accountable.
Schedule B, hereto annexed, contains a statement of all debts in said inventory mentioned, not collected or collectable by me, together with the reasons why the same have not been collected, and are not collectable, and also a statement of the
articles of personal property mentioned in said inventory unsold, and the reasons of the same being unsold, and their appraised value; and also a statement of all property mentioned therein lost by accident, without any wilful default or negligence, the cause of its loss and appraised value. No other assets than those in said inventory, or herein set forth, have come to my possession or knowledge, and all the increase or decrease in the value of any assets of said deceased is allowed or charged in said Schedules A and B.
Schedule C, hereto annexed, contains a statement of all moneys paid by me for funeral and other necessary expenses for said estate, together with the reasons and object of such expenditure.
On or about the twenty-fourth day of May, 1865, I caused a notice for claimants to present their claims against the said estate to me within the period fixed by law, and at a certain place therein specified, to be published in two newspapers according to law, for six months, pursuant to an order of the Surrogate of the County of New York; to which order, notice and due proof of publication on file at Surrogates office, I refer as part of this account.
Schedule D, hereto annexed, contains a statement of all the claims of creditors presented to and allowed by me, or disputed by me, and for which a judgment or decree has been rendered against me, together with the names of the claimants, the general nature of the claim, its amount and the time of the rendition of the judgment; it also contains a statement of all moneys paid by me to the creditors of the deceased, and their names and the time of such payment.
Schedule E, hereto annexed, contains a statement of all moneys paid to the legatees, widow or next of kin of the deceased.
Schedule F, hereto annexed, contains the names of all persons entitled, as widow legatee or next of kin of the deceased, to a share of his estate, with their places of residence, degree of relationship, and a statement of which of them are minors, and whether they have any general guardian, and if so, their names and places of residence, to the best of my knowledge, information, and belief.
Schedule G, hereto annexed, contains a statement of all other facts affecting my administration of said estate, my rights, and those of others interested therein.

My dear General: I have had a correspondence with Reverdy Johnson, of which I ought, perhaps, to give you some account.
He writes, asking my authority for the statements in the book concerning him. I replied -- the Charleston papers, and the documents furnished by you.
He writes again, saying that nearly everything in the book about him was wrong. He was not a member of the Charleston Convention, had never been in Charleston. He then launched into comments upon your despatch to Mr. Seward in the Fago case, in which you made a few feeble remarks upon
the consequences of Mr. Johnson's course in New Orleans. Those comments were such as you can imagine, and need not be repeated.
I replied, regretting the Charleston mistake, and offering to do all in my power to correct it; but said that it would not become me to make any remarks upon points of difference between you and him, and that the only use I should make of his letter would be to correct my own mistakes (He had wound up his letter by saying I could make any use of it I pleased).
I immediately wrote a correction for the Tribune, and sent down correction to the printers.
He replied that he was perfectly satisfied. The next day, he sent another note, calling my attention to a speech of his for the Union, delivered as early as January 1861.
That is about the substance of it.
I hear nothing from Col. Shaffer in reply to my last, asking about what sum he was willing to go in advertising the German book.
You will not, of course, reply to this. I do not wish you to waste any of your valuable time upon me. I hope Mrs. Butler has received the finely bound copy of the book, done for her by the binders, and sent three weeks ago.

"March 26, 1864","From General Butler
Head Quarters 18th Army Corps, Department of Virginia & North Carolina,
Fortress Monroe, March 26, 1864
Hon. Edwin M. Stanton, Secretary of War
Sir: My attention has been called by my medical director to a letter from General Banks, now commanding the Department of the Gulf, in relation to the claim of James Syme, a
druggist of New Orleans, an alleged British subject, for property seized by the United States Government, a copy of which and the endorsement thereon I enclose for your information. With this letter, perhaps, I have nothing official to do save to order the medical director, as I have done, to forward the inventory asked for.
But I do not think that I ought, as a faithful servant of the Government, to stand idly by and see the Government robbed of many thousand dollars, so large a sum indeed in the language of the letter of General Banks, ""We have not in this Department (of the Gulf) money to answer it,"" and not put the Government in possession of the facts known to myself, and on which the claim rests, and which in my judgment forever preclude James Syme from any claim before the Government be he citizen, British subject, or unrepenting or repenting rebel. Indeed, if this claim is allowed in the spirit in which it seems to be treated in the letter to which I am calling attention, it will amount to more than the hundred and fifty thousand dollars.
The facts then are briefly these: James Syme has lived in this country many years, indeed since his earliest youth has carried on business in New Orleans, where he exercised all the rights of a citizen, and I am informed held city offices and voted, but of this I cannot speak save from information not throughly investigated.
That if a foreign subject, he was a most bitter enemy to the country, was notorious at New Orleans, and on my landing there Syme refused to sell medicines for gold to my soldiers, alleging that he would not sell to the Yankees. This fact was fully investigated and ascertained at the time.
Afterwards, finding that a large business was being done in smuggling medicines and drugs to the Rebels, I caused an investigation to be made, which resulted in the seizure on board of the Government transport of barrels of hard bread, which were filled in the centre with large amounts, many thousands of dollars worth in the Confederacy, of quinine and morphia.
These barrels of bread were to be sent up the river under passes as planters' provisions, and then landed at proper points and sent to the rebel army then at camp there. Some forty or more rebels from the river tracing these barrels of bread, I found they came from Syme's store, and had been packed there.
I then caused Syme to be arrested, and examined the whole
matter of his transactions personally, and in his presence took from these barrels and boxes quinine and morphia from amongst the bread; which, after hearing the witnesses examined in his presence, Syme confessed was sold by him for the purpose and with the knowledge it was to be sent through our lines to the Rebels.
Upon examination of Syme's books, there appeared to have been a long course of such dealing. During the examination of the parties in Syme's store, (which is a very large wholesale druggist establishment,) who had charge of, packed the goods and sent away, it came out that large quantities of sulphur had been carried from thence. That for the purposes of conveying the sulphur away secretly, it had been put in boxes which were put inside of larger boxes, and the vacant spaces stuffed with hay.
This witness, a very intelligent and as it appeared truthful mulatto slave of Syme's, stated this sulphur had been sent through the lines to be sent to Georgia to the powder works there, and told the schooner upon which it was put. Upon this information I examined one Henderson, a clerk for Syme, who admitted all these facts, and made a full confession of the nature of Syme's business. Upon being confronted with this testimony, Syme confessed that the sulphur had been put up in his shop and sent away as alleged.
Upon this evidence of Syme's aiding and abetting the enemy and supplying them with munitions of war while living under the protection of the United States Flag, I ordered his stock of goods, as well the quinine and surgical instruments which he had refussed to sell to the soldiers of the Union as the sulphur and morphia that he was supplying to the enemy, to be sequestered to the use of the Hospitals of the army for the benefit of the sick and wounded soldiers, to whom Syme had refused even to sell his medicines, while he was furnishing the enemy the materials for the ammunition with which they were hurt. And farther, that he be confined at hard labor for three years, or during the War.
The facts being found from irrefragable evidence, as well as by Syme's own confession, of the justice of that sentence I had no doubt, and although appeals were made to me in a variety of forms to allow Syme his liberty, they were always refused. I will do Mr. Coppell, the Acting Consul of her Britannic Majesty, the justice to say that while he promptly enough interposed his protection for Syme upon the claim
made that he was a British subject, yet, when the grounds of the decision against Syme were explained to him, he seemed to acquiesce in view of the enormity of his crimes, and rightly too, because, if Syme were entitled to British protection, he had so flagrantly violated the neutrality laws as to put him beyond its pale, and being a foreign subject he had no ties of nationality or attachment to local institutions in which he had no part as to justify his treachery to the flag which protected him, and the gross breach of the hospitality which sheltered him.
You will therefore judge of my surprise upon learning that an inquiry had been had after I left the Department of the Gulf, without notice to me, although the records of my official action, and the fact that I had personally examined the matter appeared upon the records of the Department, without a single witness who knew anything of the matter on behalf of the United States having been called, and a decision had, which brings a claim upon the Treasury of more than a hundred and fifty thousand dollars, so large in its unjust thriftiness that in the language of the Commanding General ""there is not within the Department money enough to answer to it."" One would naturally have supposed that the Commanding General of that Department, having in other days when we were both at the city, more than once availed himself of my services in court to aid him in the trial of his cases, upon learning that I had officially investigated the facts in Syme's case in person and adjudicated thereon, would have thought that I was quite as capable of coming to a correct decision upon the issue between the United States and James Syme as the subordinate officer he appointed upon the commission, who, I doubt not, would have had sufficient discrimination to have come to a right conclusion even without experience in such matters if they had had any evidence upon which to build.
I have now done my duty in this matter in my endeavor to protect the Government of the United States against an enormous and wicked claim. I have laid the facts before the proper Departments of the Government. I have entered my protest respectfully, as I ought, and firmly as I must, against a worse than rebel traitor being paid from the taxes of the Loyal. The money he has confessed he made by selling munitions of war to the disloyal, and if he is so paid, then I shall have the proud satisfaction of reflecting that I have done
all that in me lay to prevent so great a wrong. I have the honor to be, very respectfully,
Your obedient servant,

General: I have the honor to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of Feb. 24th, enclosing a copy of a despatch from Lord Lyons to the Secretary of State, and also a copy of a letter from Dr. James Syme to Lord Lyons in reference to the seizure of his property at New Orleans, with instructions from the Secretary of War, ""that prompt measures be taken for the relief of Dr. Syme, the rent of the building to be paid for the assumed, and such of the property as has been converted to the use of the Government paid for.""
A very thorough investigation of this case was made, a report of which was transmitted to the Government at Washington. The conclusion of the Commission, which I believe competent to decide upon the case, was in favor of the innocence of Dr. Syme of any charges against him, but the amount of property of which he was deprived was very large. We have not in this Department the means to answer it, nor the evidence to justify the payment of his claim. The inventory or stock book of Dr. Syme, which showed the amount of stock on hand in the store up to the first of August, 1862, which is said to have been delivered to Dr. McCormack, Medical Director of this Department at that time, is not to be found.
We have no other evidence upon which the claim of Dr. Syme can be verified, and I transmitted the report of the Commission to Washington in order that it might be determined there what amount should be paid to him.
In regard to the other points of instruction, I have the honor to say, that I have this day instructed the Quartermaster to notify the landlord of the premises leased by Dr. Syme, that the Government would be responsible for the rent from the time of his dispossession up to the period of his re-occupation, and that he would not be allowed to cancel the lease held by Dr. Syme on account of the occupation of the premises by the
Government of the United States. I had also instructed the Quartermaster to deliver the premises to Dr. Syme whenever he shall claim them, and will take immediate measures to ascertain what amount of property has been realized from the Government, as far as evidence is in our possession, and to provide for its payment as far as possible.
As soon as I shall receive information upon this subject, I will transmit a report to your department. I would respectfully request that Dr. McCormack, formerly Medical Director of this Department, be called upon for any inventory of stock book, which is said to have been delivered to him at the time the property was seized, or if it has been lost, that a certificate to that effect may be given, as requested by Dr. Syme.

The articles for the government up to the time I was relieved were accounted for in my quarterly returns to your office.
When I took possession I employed an apothecary, by name Eunermoser, a German, to take an account of the stock immediately upon its coming into my hands, but finding he had been

Gen'l. Butler to be used as a hospital, came to me and said, ""You being a druggist and chemist, I wish you would post me on Drugs, Chemicals, and Instruments for the use of this Department, as there has been none furnished from Ship Island by Doct. Bache, Medical Director, and as I must have them for the requisitions that are being made on me."" I went with him to a Mr. Syme, a wholesale druggist, on Canal St., to purchase the articles wanted. Mr. Syme in very strong language informed us that we could not have them for gold or treasury notes, as he did not recognize the Federal Government. We left his store and went to Hart & Co., informed Mr. Hart of our errand. He did not want to sell to the United States Government, but supposed he must. Dr. Smith bought some Drugs of Hart & Co. They had no instruments, none could be found except at Syme's store. Went again to Syme, offered cash down in gold, he still refused to sell. Dr. Smith then informed the Maj. General of Syme's refusal. The Maj. Gen. then ordered the Doct. to take them, giving a receipt for the same. I went back with the Doct. and selected the instruments.
Syme objected to our taking them, his language was of such a Rebel tone that I suspected he was then furnishing the Rebels with medicines and instruments, and therefore gave the information whereby he was watched, arrested, and convicted of smuggling medicines through the lines for the use of the Confederate Army.

Washington, March 30th, 1864. Hon. W. H. Seward, Sec. of State of the U. S.
Sir: I came to this city from Norfolk to make some explanations in regard to my case, which was referred to you by the British Minister in December last. I called at the British Legation yesterday, to see if my case had been decided, and for the first time was informed that I had been reported as a violent secessionist, and as having no claim to British protection. In reference to my being a violent secessionist, you will allow me to say, I never was a secessionist; to the contrary, when I was allowed to do so under the laws of the State of Virginia, I used all my influence against secession. Since the state seceded, I never have voted either in the seceded states or under the United States government, as I would not be allowed to do so without becoming naturalized. And I most emphatically disclaim any improper feelings towards the government of the United States, and have studiously avoided any disobedience of the orders and regulations in the Military Department at Norfolk, and have always advised my friends to obey the laws under which they lived. There is no one who deprecates the bitter feeling that has existed in Norfolk more than I do.
It is intimated in the report herein referred to that I pretend to be a British subject, and that I have no claim to British protection. I have to say that I do not claim protection from the British Government for the purpose of evading any law, but because I never have been naturalized, as required by the naturalization laws of the United States, without which it is impossible for me to become a citizen of the U. States. I have
been questioned in regard to having voted. I can only say that in the year 1844, in the month of October, I took the oath of fidelity to the state of Virginia, as an alien, whereupon I was entitled to all the privileges of a citizen of Virginia, upon which I was allowed to vote for Mr. Clay as President. Since that time I have [not] voted. These privileges were granted under a law passed by the General Assembly of Virginia in 1792. I was known as a British subject before the Federal authorities came to Norfolk, and have been recognized as a British subject by the Military authorities, and also by the State and City government. And I now have a license from under the hands of General Viele to show that fact. Since that time I have taken an oath, in lieu of the oath of allegiance, to the U. S., as proposed by the Hon. W. Stuart of the British Legation, and in compliance with a letter of instructions from Hon. S. P. Chase, Secretary of the treasury of the U. States to the collector of customs at Baltimore, which oath I have endeavored to keep, as I have not knowingly or wilfully done anything against the U. States, and I disclaim any improper feelings towards the Government of the U. S. If it shall be decided between you and the British Minister that I am not a British subject entitled to British protection, or that I am an American citizen, I will take the oath of allegiance to the U. S.
I do not wish to put my construction on the law of the State of Virginia herein referred to, but respectfully refer you to the opinion of Hon. John S. Wilson and the British Consul, which I presume you are in possession of, which opinions agree exactly with the opinion of the Clerk of the Court, who administered the oath of fidelity to me in 1844.
All of which I respectfully submit, hoping you will have the matter decided immediately. With great respect, I am,

with a Court Martial then going on. Several Colonels were being tried, Whitford, Cannady, and others, but that Gen. Barton had been cleared, -- he says he was with the forces when the late demonstration was made towards Newbern, and that their strength was estimated at 20,000 -- the 24th he says is at Tarboro, and five companies of cavalry at Greenville, and I think he said some infantry. Such is the story. It was a very straight one, but must be received with caution. You can judge better than I can as to its accuracy in regard to affairs at Kinston. He says you have blockaded the river and put in torpedoes, or rather they have heard so at Kinston.
Our 200 pdr. now has a good range down the river. In regard to removing the 100 pdr. from Fort Gray, I am of opinion that in such an event it would be as well to abandon the position entirely, and am not sure but it would be well to do so anyhow, though not if an attack was imminent, but supposing there was time, so as to place the three guns in position, which would require some days, to prepare embankments and magazines. Col. Dutton can inform you on that subject.
I am informed that the gunboat was brought down to Hamilton on Friday a week ago.
The informant alluded to above, states that a man of Hoke's brigade at Kinston had been detailed as a pilot for the gunboat on this river. If this man's statements should prove correct, it would be well that it should not be made public. He states so many facts that I know to be true that I am forced to give considerable weight to his narrative.
The lines of the enemy have not been fully closed as previously stated by me, for I find that a number of citizens of this county (probably rebel sympathizers) have passed up and down, as it is said, to exchange their money at Tarboro for Confederate bonds.
I have caused the hulks to be placed in the position recommended by the board (except the last one sent by your order, which will be carried up in the morning), each one provided by Captain F -- with a torpedo, to be exploded by contact, and which he hopes will prove effective, it will have a moral effect probably, and cause delay if nothing else. To make the obstruction more complete, I should be glad to have one more hulk if possible, and even two could be used to advantage.
I will continue to communicate to you such information as reaches me.
Respectfully yours, W. Wessells, Brig. Gen.
We are short of old hulks. In the late storm, the water rose 3 feet in the river here, and it is feared that some of the obstructions may be carried away. The great danger is in the Roanoke.

Dear Sir: Your note of the 26th inst. is received, and I am glad to be able this time to answer speedily.
I am much obliged for your suggestion. When I settled my accounts at the War Office, the question of what should be done with this money of Sam Smith & Co. came under discussion, and I then said to the Secretary of War that as a lawyer I supposed I might be held personally liable for the sum, and that if he would give me an Order to pay over the money to the War Office, in such form to release me from responsibility, if hereafter called upon by Smith & Co., I should be glad to pay the money over. He doubted whether this could be done, and suggested that the money might lie in my hands until the Department was called upon for it, and that a proper memorandum should be put on file, so that Smith & Co.'s rights, if
they had any, should be preserved, as well as my own. There is no difficulty in dealing with the money now, in the same way.
If the War Department directs an order to me to pay the money, either into the Treasury or the contingent fund of the Department, and Smith & Co., acting under your advice, will give me a memorandum stating that such payment shall relieve me from personal responsibility, I will give a draft for the amount on the Asst. Treasurer of the United States that will be honored at once.
I think it but right, however, that my first note to you, stating the facts of the capture of the money, should be laid before the War Department for its information, before any order is made on the subject, transferring the funds to Smith & Co. I have the honor to be, very resp.

General: I have had an interview with Mr. Oliver and the friend who was making investigations and arrangements as to bringing away produce from Suffolk. They explain that the arrangement suggested to take effect the 6th of April applied particularly to the shipment of produce at Old South Quay, but as far as Suffolk is concerned, it can be put in operation in two days, and by sending the agent ahead, the neutral ground described will be free from soldiers by the immediate withdrawal of all who are now there, and there will be none to interfere with the shipment. If, therefore, the consent of Admiral Lee should not be necessary for the trip to Suffolk, or, if the Admiral should have received instructions as represented, with your approbation, the trip might be made as soon as the preliminary arrangements, orders, etc., can be completed, which will occupy only two days from the commencement of proceedings.
For the reasons stated to you, and on account of the peculiar
wants and conditions of the people of the vicinage, Mr. Oliver would like to be allowed to take with him, instead of some portion of the dry goods an additional quantity of bacon or pork, which can be obtained at Norfolk, and also some whiskey also obtained at Norfolk, none of which he has now on board.
Will you be kind enough, if you approve the proposed change in the cargo, to designate to the bearer of this note the respective amounts to be allowed, and also what will be necessary to be done on the part of Mr. Oliver to enable him to make the trip to Suffolk.
Hoping this arrangement may by this means soon be perfected by which, by peaceful means and without public expense, the property of loyal citizens may be snatched from the grasp of the enemies of our country. I am very truly

Colonel: I have the honor to call your attention to the fact that I have just received a communication from Gen. Marston, Commdg. at Point Lookout, transmitting a copy of the proceedings of a Board of Officers convened at this Point to investigate and report the facts and circumstances connected with the shooting of a prisoner of war, named Peyton, on the 20th inst.
The Board was convened and the original proceeding forwarded to Col. Hoffman, agreeable to an Order issued by direction of the Secretary of War, dated on the 17th inst.
It would seem that this Order was issued directly to Gen. Marston, without having passed through these Headquarters.
It would tend greatly to the regularity of business if communications to the Officer Commanding the Prisoners' Camp
at Point Lookout could take the usual and ordinary course presented by the regulations of the army. If the usual course had been taken in this instance, perhaps the findings of the Board of Inquiry would have been more satisfactory.
If it had been composed of officers selected by the Comdg. General, not from the regiments immediately in charge of the prisoners of war, each of whom may be subject to a like investigation for a like act, and be supposed therefore to have a fellow [feeling], and in saying this, I in no manner mean to impugn the probity or propriety of action of the present Board, it might have been more satisfactory. But as I have not been notified in the proceeding of course I have not examined it.
But it seems to me that in the very delicate matter of inquiring into the taking of the life of a man, especially a prisoner of war, which may be misrepresented to our Rebel enemies, and lead to attempted retaliations, it should appear that the facts were found by a Board which, like Caesar's wife, should be beyond suspicion.

Dear Sir: I have your note in relation to the examination of Capt. McLoughin, and have every desire to oblige you, and would do so were I not sure that if you understood the circumstances,
as I do, you would agree with me in my approval of the Board of Examination. And to make sure of that, I send you a copy of that examination. Now, Capt. McLoughin's complaint is that he was ""not asked any question in Infantry Tactics.""
After the first statement, as you will see, of his service in Infantry, it was assumed by the Board that he had sufficient knowledge of Infantry Tactics without further examination; so that there was no occasion of asking him upon that subject.
The matters to be passed upon were: had he sufficient present knowledge of the profession to fit him to command a company of Heavy Artillery? or not having that, had he a sufficient ground-work of education or general knowledge to render him likely to learn easily, and readily, his profession?
Now, my instructions to the Board were that a man asking for a position of lieutenant should be able to pass such examination as a youth of seventeen would be obliged to do, to be permitted to enter West Point, and it would seem clear that a Captain, to command one hundred and forty-five men, should be able to tell, ""How much coffee is your Company of one hundred and forty-five men entitled to, at fifteen pounds to the one hundred rations, for seven days?"" which Capt. McLoughin could not do. He should be able to tell, ""How much is one-half of five-sixths?"" which Capt. McLoughin could not do. He should be able to answer, ""How many pounds of bread would you draw for a Company of one hundred and forty men for seven days: the daily allowance for each man being thirtytwo ounces?"", which Capt. McLoughin could not do. How could Capt. McLoughin make a requisition for supplies for his Company to start on a march?
Again, in general knowledge, one would suppose that a Captain in the Artillery branch of the United States service in this age of the world, should know ""what form of Government has the United States?"" which Capt. McLoughin did not know.
It would seem that a New Yorker, bred and born there, of twenty-two years of age, who aspires to command a Company of New York Heavy Artillery, should at least know that New York, does not bound Pennsylvania on the South. Otherwise he might possibly, being in Pennsylvania, march his Company south, in order to get into New York. Until Capt. McLoughin so answered the question, I would not have believed that there was any New Yorker, bred and born, who did not know ""when
and where Alexander Hamilton lived""; but Capt. McLoughin did not.
A gunner Quadrant is one of the means used to get the elevation of a piece of Heavy Artillery, and yet a man who aspires to be a Capt. of Heavy Artillery, in actual service in the field, when asked, ""What is a Quadrant of a circle?"" answers that he ""never heard the term"" before. Now, Sir, if you, as a member of the Congress of the United States in the House of Representatives thereof, representing the great State of New York, which does not bound Pennsylvania on the South, and where Alexander Hamilton lived and died, after reading this examination will certify to me that in your judgment you disagree with the findings of my Commission in the case of Capt. McLoughin, ""That Capt. McLoughin does not evince sufficient general knowledge to perform the duties of a Captain of Artillery, but might do well in a lower grade, where he could profit by the experience of a competent Captain,"" I promise to carefully review Capt. McLoughin's case, and join the recommendation that he be re-examined for his position, but I am certain, my dear Sir, that you will fully agree with me that, however meritorious in other respects Capt. McLoughin may be, there are men in New York more capable from general education and knowledge of the profession of arms to perform the duties of a Commander of a Company of Heavy Artillery than Capt. McLoughin. I have the honor to be, very respectfully,

The question has ceased to be of any practical value so far as this Department is concerned, as we have the men laboring.

Major Genl. Benj. F. Butler, Comdg. Dept. of Va. & N. C., Fort Monroe, Va.
In the spring campaign, which it is desirable shall commence at as early a day as practicable, it is proposed to have
coöperative action of all the armies in the field, as far as the object can be accomplished.
It will not be possible to unite our armies into two or three large ones, to act as so many units, owing to the absolute necessity of holding on to the territory already taken from the enemy. But generally speaking, concentration can be practically effected by armies moving to the interior of the enemy's country from the territory they have to guard. By such movement they interpose themselves between the enemy and the country to be guarded thereby, reducing the number necessary to guard important points, and at least occupy the attention of part of the enemy's force, if no greater object is gained. Lee's army and Richmond being the greater objects towards which our attention must be directed in the next campaign, it is desirable to unite all the force against them.
The necessity for covering Washington with the Army of the Potomac, and of covering your department with your army, makes it impossible to unite these forces at the beginning of any move I propose, therefore do what comes nearest this of anything that seems practicable. The Army of the Potomac will act from its present base, Lee's army being the objective point. You will collect all the forces from your command that can be spared from garrison duty. I should say not less than twenty thousand effective men, to operate on the south side of the James River, Richmond being your object point. To the force you already have will be added about ten thousand men from South Carolina, under Major Gen. Gillmore, who will command them in person. Major Genl. W. F. Smith is ordered to report to you to command the troops sent into the field from your own department.
Genl. Gillmore will be ordered to report to you at Fort Monroe with all his troops on transports by the 18th inst., or as soon thereafter as practicable. Should you not receive notice by that time to move, you will make such disposition of them and your other forces as you may deem best calculated to deceive the enemy as to the real move to be made.
When you are notified to move, take City Point with as much force as possible. Fortify or rather intrench at once, and concentrate all your troops for the field there as rapidly as you can. From City Point directions cannot be given at this time for your further movements.
The fact that has already been stated, that is, that Richmond
is to be your objective point, and that there is to be coöperation between your force and the Army of the Potomac, must be your guide. This indicates the necessity of your holding close to the south bank of the James River as you advance. Then should the enemy be forced into his intrenchments in Richmond, the Army of the Potomac would follow, and by means of transports the two armies would become a unit. All the minor details of your advance are left entirely to your direction. If, however, you think it practicable to use your cavalry south of you, so as to cut the railroad about Hick's Ford about the time of the general advance, it would be of immense advantage.
You will please forward for my information at the earliest practicable day all orders, details, and instructions you may give for the execution of this order.

but also to learn personally his interpretation of your orders. He assumes to decide what we may do, and what we may not. I found him favorably disposed to assist us, if we would do as he wished, to wit: take the colored people in that district off from the places they are now on, and put them, to shift for themselves, on poor out-lands, where there are neither buildings or fences. He offered neither a team, tool, boards, or nails; and no shelter for over a thousand persons save seven old tents, and those, provided they could be spared. I then requested him to allow me to occupy the farms that with the advice of Gens. Dix and Keyes I had last year, and also several others, having on them several out buildings unoccupied, and which with trifling repairs I believed to be nearly sufficient to furnish comfortable shelter for all the colored persons in that vicinity requiring aid. He did not deny that these places were clearly rebel property, and wholly occupied by ""secesh"" squatters and negroes, but said they had taken the ""oath,"" and therefore he did not care to disturb them.
On one of these farms, I had made a contract with an excellent Massachusetts farmer, who with a large number of colored people had done, and was doing, a great deal in preparation for Spring crops. With a full knowledge of your own, and Col. Kinsman's orders, and without a pretense of anything wrong, other than this, General Wistar ordered him arrested as a culprit, and reprimanded him sharply, and forbade his going near the place again.
On another plantation from which I had removed a squatter, and put in his place a good Union man, more particularly to get the use of the grist-mill upon it, which we very much needed, the Union man was driven off and the squatter restored, and no rent required.
On another was a man who had formerly been the overseer of the place, and who had had the use of the stock, tools, etc. for nearly three years. I notified him to remove, within a reasonable time. The General retained him, and gave him the stock, tools, etc. for his personal property.
Several of this class of men are living upon farms bordering upon York River, and at certain points within sight of the rich rebel, A. M. Dean's house which is on the opposite side of the river, and beyond our lines. This rebel has remarkable facilities for getting the very latest intelligence and papers through the lines, and not only by signals day and
night, but from a cupola in his house, with his large spy-glass he can discover the movement of our troops and gunboats, -- as is believed he did just previous to our last attempt to enter Richmond, -- and start off, as often as he pleases, the waiting spies. A deserter might know something, but this man more. Gen. Wistar was informed of these facts, by one of his officers. He called for the evidence, and having examined it, he expressed himself satisfied. The next morning his informant waited on him, hoping to have the privilege of going over to this house, and breaking up the rendezvous, and capturing the man and his spies. On introducing the subject, the General replied that he has sent the man a little warning to desist, or he would arrest him and burn his house. I do not state this case of my own personal knowledge, or in the form in which I think it should appear, but it comes to me from a source in which I have entire confidence, and partly corroborates itself; and it shows that General Wistar has these facts before him, and still allows such men to remain at exposed points, and refuses to let them be rented to such men as are recommended by Dr. Loring and Mr. Bancroft of Salem, or even to let me stock them, and manage them myself, the only reason he assigned for refusal being his fear that the negroes would smuggle. I told him that I had been accustomed, and by your orders was authorized to call for, or take possession of all plantations and personal property, considered as heretofore belonging to rebels, giving them notice, and if they wished to avail themselves of any right they often pretended to have, recourse could be had to the Provost Judge. He said he did not recognize them, your orders, as having any reference to him, but to us. He said he was acting under an old order from Gen. Dix, and until it was revoked, and an order given more explicit than any he had yet seen, he should not recognize our right to do anything either there at Yorktown, or anywhere in the County, with negroes or plantations, except by his consent. He having said we had no business there, I proposed to report to you that Mr. Churchill had better be withdrawn, and the whole enterprise given up, to which he objected, urging that if anyone was to be there, he should be, to act as an agent of his, and that no other course would be tolerated except by your Special Order.

General: Excuse me for again trespassing on your valuable time, but as some malicious and utterly false reports have been circulated concerning my husband's conduct during the period of his parole, by parties ignorant of the fact that it was by your authority he enjoyed the privilege of a visit to his home, I am most anxious to assure you on my word of honor that your restrictions were most particularly observed. My husband did not cross the threshold of his door, nor did he even appear at a window during his stay, but on the third day of his visit he was summoned by order of the Provost Marshal to report in his presence. Capt. Williams had not been informed by Capt. Patterson that such a ceremony was necessary, but Major Haynes said an officer paroled from one Department and sent into another was always subject to arrest unless he reported at Head Quarters. This I assure you was the only time he was absent from his home, but some person, seeing him driving through Madison St. on his way to the Marshal's office, or probably seeing him drive from the boat to his home on the morning of his arrival, reported to the Marshal that Capt. Williams had been driving about the city generally, on which charge he was arrested a few hours before his departure, by order of Major Haynes. On examination the charges being proved groundless, he was not prevented from leaving here in time to report to Capt. Patterson according to the terms of his parole.
I feel sure, General, you had confidence in the sincerity of my promise at the time you granted my desire, and now need no further assurance that we have acted in good faith throughout. Be assured I shall always feel the debt of gratitude I owe you, and hope I may some day have an opportunity in person of expressing my thanks.

Sir: I have the honor to acknowledge the receipt of the letter of the learned Attorney General of the United States, in relation to the supposed confiscation of the estate of John Williams, a Rebel at Norfolk.
The letter of the Attorney General is based upon the complaint of one Chas. W. Butts, who was at one time an officer in the United States service, and resigned from that service, and has since occupied his time in plundering United States soldiers who were so far unfortunate as to become criminals. I have had my eye for some time on Butts, and it was owing to the press of other business that I did not order him out of the Department long since, an omission I sincerely regret, but one I have since remedied.
The accompanying report of. Gen. Wild, with the papers enclosed, will explain the entire transaction. In relation to Williams' estate, his whole action in the premises meets my
full approval. He uses the word confiscate where he should have used the word sequestrate, but his explanation upon that point is satisfactory. The difficulty was that Gen. Wild is not a lawyer. Now, with the utmost respect to the learned Attorney General of the United States, I have the honor to insist as a lawyer, as well as the Commander of the Department, and in the first capacity, I have some right to an opinion, that the taking possession of an enemy's property for military purposes is not a ""stretch of military law,"" but is in exact conformity with it, and with General Order 100, series of 1863, which was published for the benefit of Commanders. But without that order, which settles it beyond all possibility of cavil, there never could have been any doubt thereof, and the learned Attorney General, I know, will, upon reading the report of Gen. Wild, concur fully with me in the opinion I have expressed as to Butts, and had ordered him out of his District, before I had finished him, by ordering him out of the Department. I have the honor to be,

Sir: I have this day received the enclosed letter, from Charles W. Butts, a resident, practising lawyer at Norfolk, Virginia. I do not personally know Mr. Butts, but understand that he is a very respectable man and a lawyer of fair attainments. He was an officer in a Pennsylvania Regiment of Cavalry, and at the end of his military service settled himself in Norfolk to practise law there. He was highly recommended for U. S. Attorney in that District. The Military Order of which he complains (as copied into the letter) is very extraordinary, and seems to me a great stretch of power without and against law. I have no evidence upon the subject but Mr. Butts' letter, and therefore do not affirm the genuineness of the Order, but I suppose of course the facts must be known in the War Department.
The confiscation laws require that proceedings for condemnation shall be judicial and in the Court, and the President by special orders has charged this Department with the general superintendence and control of such proceedings.
I respectfully refer the matter to your consideration, and
beg that if such an order has really been issued, you will take such measures as may seem to you most proper to redress the wrong. I have the honor to be,

General Wild, as you are aware, is the Military Commander of the respective cities Norfolk and Portsmouth, and has a Provost Marshal in the City of Portsmouth who, in my opinion (and I have had considerable military experience), is not a fit and proper person to be a Provost Marshal over white people. What I wish to complain of is the following order (Copy enclosed).
Mr. Williams resides in Portsmouth with his family, and has taken the Oath of Allegiance under the President's Proclamation.

Maj. Gen. B. F. Butler, Commanding Dept.
Va. and North Carolina
General: In reply to your endorsement, in relation to the seizing of John Williams' estate, I have the honor to report.
I am fully aware of the difference between confiscation by due course of law, and a military confiscation, seizure, or occupation. The estate of John Williams was taken wholly in the latter way: and I have never pretended that it was any more a final disposition of his property than in several other cases of estates occurring lately; on the contrary, as the
Order complained of (No. 1) will show, Williams had (10) days' grace before occupation to show cause why the estate should not be taken for military purposes. The circumstances were these: Dec. 10th, General Order No. 49 (No. 2) from Headquarters Dept. of Virginia and North Carolina, inviting all to take the Oath under the President's Amnesty Proclamation, was issued, and the consequences of a refusal were published to all. Two months later, February 12th, was issued General Orders No. 20 (No. 3), from Department Va. and North Carolina.
During this interval, every property holder had plenty of time to make up his mind whether to register himself as a friend or a ""rebel."" Yet even then I waited two or three weeks longer before ousting any resident rebels to occupy their estates; though all the time in need of houses for military purposes.
John Williams, though always living within gun-shot of the Provost Marshal's office, had never taken the Oath of Allegiance: on the contrary, had openly refused to do so, and openly declared his sympathies were with the South; a barefaced, shameless rebel.
March the 7th, nearly a month after the promulgation of General Orders No. 20, his case being reported by the Provost Marshal, Capt. Brown, Supt. of Negro Affairs, made application for the use of some of his houses, which I at once approved, as seen by the accompanying document (No. 4). This being merely a hasty endorsement, in using the word, ""confiscate"" I neglected to define it as military and not a judicial confiscation; thereby laying myself open to attack from patriotic and discriminating ""Butts,"" but the real intent and manner of the seizure is plain in the remaining phrases of the same endorsement by which these tenements were put through the usual form of our military occupation, for which see the accompanying circular (No. 5) of March 18th. This circular will show that our work is not done loosely, dishonestly, or blindly.
This endorsement was enough for the Provost Marshal to act upon; he accordingly issued the Order complained of, adopting from one the offensive word ""confiscate."" But to give the Post Q. M. proper authority, we, as in all other cases, issued a Special Order (No. 6). This being the permanent record, contains as will be seen nothing about confiscation, but makes it a purely military occupation under General Order No. 20.
Thus far, we have in fact proceeded under authority and according to precedent. But at this crisis there came in a new and complicated phrase; John Williams, after contemplating his fate for five days, concluded that it would be better to take the Oath than to try ""beggary,"" accordingly applied to the Provost Marshal, Captain Messinger, of Portsmouth, for that purpose, acknowledging that he proposed to take the Oath avowedly to save his property, acknowledging that his heart would remain as rebellious as ever. Capt. Messinger very properly refused to administer the Oath under such circumstances, which decision I confirmed for that and all similar cases. Williams then came to these Head Quarters, and commenced sounding Capt. Johnston, A. A. G., as to what he might expect from me, providing he took the Oath saying that he proposed to take the Oath to save his property, and if it would not save his property, he would not take the Oath.
Captain Johnston expounded to him the nature and force of the Oath, and stated to him that if he took it in good faith, and meant to live up to it, that I might consider his case favorably. Encouraged by this, he then slipped into the office of Lt. Col. Wheldon. Provost Marshal of Norfolk, taking him unawares. Col. Wheldon, being ignorant of the fact that Williams lived in Portsmouth, where, by his own (Col. (Wheldon's regulations, Williams' Oath could only be issued by Capt. Messinger, Provost Marshal of Portsmouth. Lt. Col. Wheldon administered the Oath (No. 7). Williams then went home, and penned the following letter (No. 8), bringing it in person to these Head Quarters, where in conversation he again avowed that he took the Oath to save his property, and proclaimed his sympathy with the Confederate Government. Learning all the circumstances, I directly interfered, considering the Oath worthless, taken under false pretence, improperly administered, and violated in the very act of taking. I therefore, after explaining to Col. Wheldon the circumstances, sent back the certificate with a note which, with his reply is appended (No. 9).
Col. Wheldon erased his name from the certificate, and erased the Oath from the records, and I declared the Oath revoked, and Williams released from all obligations there-under. This transaction being annulled, the proceedings of seizure went on as previously.
Four days after this, March 19th, the patriotic ""Butts"" sends his complaint, or appeal, to the Attorney General,
stating that ""Williams has taken the Oath of Allegiance under the President's Proclamation,"" but omitting the date thereof, and all the context: entirely ignoring the fact that this Oath was annulled the same day (4 days previous), which fact he knew. I am glad to see that in thus annulling this Oath I am now supported by the recent Proclamation by the President of the United States, dated March 26th, 1864.
The letter from the Attorney General of the United States complains that my ""Military Order seems a great stretch of power without and against law,"" and that proceedings of condemnation should be judicial and in the Courts.
I respectfully submit that my action in no way interferes with the action of the Courts, which may proceed tomorrow, or next year, to condemn and confiscate or to restore the whole undiminished. The late owner has the same refuge, and the same chance for justice, as if I had not touched his estate. I do not pretend ""to take civil law into my own hands."" I do not proclaim that my decision shall be final and to the exclusion of all other processes: I merely, as the centre of martial law in this District, seize upon those who violate martial law to prevent further harassing and embarrassing the United States Government, and I give to the U. S. the use and benefit of the enemy's property during a time which may be longer or shorter, according to the final decision of the courts of law. That I am justified in thus using martial law in this place is shown by General Orders No. 41 (No. 10) from Major General Dix, which has never since been modified.
By this, martial law takes precedence, and civil law is merely tolerated when it does not interfere with martial law, which reigns supreme. Should this relation be changed, during the present condition of society here, the people would be miserable indeed. Very respectfully,
Your obt. servant, Edw. A. Wild, Brig. Genl. Comdg."

General: I have the honor to report that, in accordance with your verbal orders, I have investigated the facts concerning the seizure of the schooner ""Sample"" and her cargo of shingles. The investigation shows: 1st That the schooner and cargo is owned by Isaiah Respass of Washington, N. C., and that previous to her seizure by order of Col. Jourdan, Comdg. Sub-District of Beaufort, she sailed from Beaufort to Bath, N. C. and thence up the Pungo River to the mouth of Pantego Creek.
2nd that she had only one clearance or sailing permit, viz: from John A. Hedrick, Collector of Beaufort, N. C., dated Feb. 11th, 1864, permitting the vessel to go in ballast from Beaufort to Washington, N. C.
3rd That said vessel went up the Pungo River to Pantego Creek under special orders from the owner, Mr. Respass, who admits that he gave such orders without seeing any clearance papers, and without any knowledge of his right to send the vessel up the Pungo River. It is fair to state that Mr. Respass states that he supposed the papers were all right.
The Captain of the schooner and Mr. Respass do not agree upon one important particular: Capt. Bragg states that Mr. Respass told him that the permit to go in ballast from Beaufort to Washington was sufficient authority for her to go up the Pungo River. Mr. Respass declares that he did not make this statement. The vessel had no permit to go to Bath, and she had no permit to go up the Pungo River to Pantego Creek. In going to either of these places she violated her clearance papers, and is therefore liable to confiscation. Mr. Respass, as it appears, is the only responsible party in the transaction. He says he sinned through ignorance. It is a question how long a man has the privilege of pleading ignorance in violations of military rules and regulations. It might be supposed that Mr. Respass, having for years been the owner of many vessels sailing from different ports, and a man of wellknown business shrewdness, and having but recently experienced the effect of violating military rules and regulations -- under these circumstances it might be supposed that Mr. Respass would have been more careful in his trading transactions and exercised great caution. I know he was properly cautioned and advised to seek proper instructions before he attempted to enter again upon speculations.
The evidence is clear that it is not safe to go up the Pungo River for any man who is loyal to the U. S. -- neither is it safe for the Government to allow irresponsible parties to go up to that section of country.
I desire to call your attention particularly to the statement of Mr. Hedrick, the Collector at Beaufort. He states that he don't like to give permits to go up the Pungo River because he has heard the Rebels were there, but yet, if any one called for such a permit, he would give it. He thinks there is no doubt about his right to give such clearances under the instructions regulating the Treasury Dept., and yet Mr. Ritch, another agent of the Dept., who I submit respectfully is a gentleman of intelligence and more than ordinary capacity as a business man, thinks there is nothing specially laid down regulating clearances for vessels, and states that he has no special instructions where vessels may go. I send up with this paper six ""permits to purchase and sell,"" and two ""clearances,"" for examination, which I think will satisfy you that there is generally a very loose way of managing this important business.
I believe that Col. Heaton, Supt. Special Agt., is also satisfied that some further restrictions are necessary to compel
obedience to regulations and prevent abuses on the part of speculators, who are intent only upon their gains and not particular of the means employed to consummate the object.
Respectfully representing that I would not limit the privilege now enjoyed by loyal people living in these trade or supply districts in bringing the products of their industry to market, and allowing them to buy and take out sufficient goods to supply the actual wants of their families and to keep them from starving, yet wholesome restrictions upon speculators and a well-defined limit to the extent of their speculations, and also to what points vessels may be cleared within the waters of this state, would be advantageous. Those who come from outside our actual lines with produce to exchange for goods, are under the eye of the officers of my Department, and cases are rare when disloyal or improper persons gain a benefit by the operation. But a person who obtains a clearance or permit to trade outside our lines goes beyond our supervision, and is not subject to our control. Papers of clearance at the Custom House, or at the offices of the local agents, should be so clear that there can be no doubt as to their meaning, and no papers should be recognized as valid unless the name of the vessel, the master, and the crew are plainly written. I think Col. Heaton intends to draw up instructions to his local agents which may cover these points. I believe every agent and officer should be held personally responsible for his individual official acts, & if this were done the business would be more closely conducted, and would give us far less trouble. While Col. Heaton, as I believe, is actuated solely for the public good, and endeavors to administer the affairs of his Department in strict compliance with the Rules and Regulations of the Treasury Dept., endeavoring to work amicably with the military authorities, I am also free to say, respectfully, that on the part of one or two of his agents there is a decided looseness of business habits and inefficiency which demands correction. I have the honor to be, General,

Sir: In looking over my Batteries to see if they are fit for field service, I find this condition of things: Battery ""A,"" 5th Artillery has but two officers, 1st Lieut. Muhlenburg and 2nd Lieut. Crabb, so it is substantially inefficient for want of officers. Almost the same condition of things obtains in Battery ""L"" of the 4th Artillery. I am informed and believe it to be a fact that out of the sixty (60) Batteries of the United States Army, but one Captain is serving with his Battery, the rest being on detached service or promoted, or as one would almost say they considered it, disgraced, by being made superior officers of Vols.
Now, it is a gross injustice to the subaltern officers serving in the Batteries that their chance of promotion should be taken away because their superiors are holding one rank in the Army while they are actually serving in the Volunteers, or else are on detached service as Commissaries of Musters, or office duty, so that no one of them gets killed by any chances. Without any more than calling your attention to this matter, which can only be settled by an Act of Congress, my present desire is that at least four (4) officers of the rank of Lieut. to take command in regular Batteries should be detailed to me.

Colonel: After waiting in vain for orders about the 16th N. Y. Artillery, and finding it necessary to bring them into some order, and finding a surplus of some 800 men which I propose to distribute among other Regiments, I ordered a very efficient Board, a copy of whose report I send you, to examine and report the proper disposition of those who were unfit for service in the field.
They report 444 unfit, and recommend that most of them be transferred to the ""Invalid Corps"" now called the ""Veteran Reserves,"" but how boys 13, 14, and 15 years of age are to be ""Veteran Reserves"" is a question I shall leave to the Department
to settle. I asked the Commission why they recommended these men to be transferred to the ""Veteran Reserves"" instead of discharging them, and it answered if they were discharged they would simply go to New York, get high bounties, enlist again, be again counted in the quota, and be sent here to be discharged again, and consequently they had better be retained here now. There seeming to be good sense in this proposition, I yielded to it and advise the transfer.
Please therefore send me an order to discharge those who ought to be discharged, without pay, as their enlistment is a fraud on the Government, and to transfer those to the ""Invalid Corps"" who are recommended to be transferred, and further to transfer the remainder of the recruits above the maximum of an artillery regiment to other New York regiments in this Department that are not filled up.

Sir: I am asked by you for a statement in regard to the ""St. Charles"" and ""Anglo American,"" two steamboats which were used by the Government in New Orleans.
Admiral Farragut arrived on the 25th of April in front of New Orleans, and claimed all the boats then lying at the
wharfs and levies, below Carroltown, as prizes to the Navy, taking formal possession of them. On the 27th he took actual possession of the ""St. Charles,"" and put her in use. On the 22nd of May I took possession of the ""Anglo American,"" repaired her, and put her to towing.
Afterwards, Admiral Farragut turned over all these boats to my Quartermaster's Department, and I receipted for them, which receipt I turned over to the Navy Department. The boats were used thereafter until their claimants, Stanton and Co. made such title to them that they were turned over to them.
I know of no other fact which would affect their claim except that in March, 1862, the firm of J. W.

"April 7, 1864","Hd. Qrs. Dept. Va. and N. C., Fort Monroe, April 7th, 1864
Hon. E. M. Stanton, Secretary of War
Sir: I have the honor to acknowledge the receipt of a communication of April 6th, 1864, from the War Department, asking my report on the facts connected with the origin, character, and proceedings, and the nature of the testimony required in relation to the Commission established by Order No. 91, of Nov. 9th, 1862, of the Department of the Gulf.
I respectfully presume that it is not my fault in the language of the communication of the War Department, that the information in relation to the Commission on the files of the War Department is indefinite.
It was established by No. 91, of Nov. 9th, 1862, and had hardly got itself working for three weeks, when I was relieved from the command on the 14th of December, and the members of the Commission, two of whom were on my Staff, were relieved from duty at the same time with myself.
There should have been the fullest and amplest records in regard to it on the files of the War Department, for the preservation of the rights of all parties because, by its operation, property ""in return"" was taken away from individuals,
and held by the Government to be returned according to the loyalty or disloyalty of the former owners.
The Order itself, a copy of which I believe to be on file in the War Department, and which if not, can be found in Parton's ""History of the Administration of the Gulf,"" page 581, entered largely into details, in order to explain the object of the Commission, as well for the guidance of the officers as for those who should be affected by it.
When I took possession of the Lafourche District, in which was almost the entire sugar crop accumulated for two years, and also at the season of the year, the first of November, when it would become necessary if at all, to make preparations for grinding the cane, then ready for the knife, I found that all the property, as well as the growing cane, and the manufactured sugar was likely to be taken from the inhabitants, whether loyal or disloyal, without any corresponding advantage to the United States.
All the transportation in that District being under military control as well by water as by rail, and all the mules and horses taken for the use of the Army, it became impossible for the private planter to bring his sugar to market. Again, he was operated upon by his fears either from his rebel proclivities, or action under compulsion from the Rebel authorities, if without these proclivities, that he would have his property taken away from him.
Actuated by these motives, he was therefore willing to part with his property for a nominal price, and a crowd of enterprising and speculative gentlemen were rushing into that District to buy his property from him. Sugar worth $80 a hogshead was being sold for twenty-five and thirty dollars. Cotton, worth sixty cents a pound, was being sold for six, so that the loyal and disloyal denizens of the soil were equally deprived of their property.
Again, in the matter of the growing cane then ready for harvest, the negroes had all fled from the plantations, and would not go back except to be under Government control, which they supposed would guarantee them their freedom as well as if they came within our camps, so that labor could not be had by the individual planter to gather his crops.
Again, wood and supplies for the sugar houses for the manufacture of the sugar could not be transorted, except through Government means, and therefore many plantations were
abandoned, and their cane crops were being sold out at nominal prices to speculators.
Again, this difficulty presented itself. That as soon as the sugar crop was gathered, we should have all the negroes in that District of the country on our hands, without any employment for them for the coming Summer, unless some-body took it in charge to see that the ""rattorus"" or cane-cutting, from which, the next crop must be raised, were laid down and protected from the frost, for the Spring planting.
This state of things had also a very demoralizing effect upon the Army, because the speculators having bought this sugar and cotton at a small price, could afford to pay, and did pay very large sums to have them brought to New Orleans by the Army transportation, either by water or by rail, so that my officers were subject to all kinds of temptations, offers, inducements, and bribes.
In view of these difficulties and for the purposes fully set forth in the Order, which need not be recapitulated, that Commission was ordered to take possession of all the property in a geographical District named, and was by the same Order sequestrated for the use of the Government, and the sales and transfers thereof forbidden.
They were directed to bring the personal property which was intended for sale to New Orleans, and there sell it at public auction. To permit any quiet, peaceable, loyal citizen, or one who desires to return to his Allegiance, to occupy his plantation, gather his crop, and put into the hands of the Commission, who would sell it at auction to the highest bidder, keeping an accurate account of the sales, charging for the transportation at such rates as fully to reimburse the Government, when Government transportation could be spared from military uses.
Further, the Commission was to furnish labor for all the plantations, to see that the negroes were well used, to make provisions for the negroes, and for the planting of the crops in the Spring.
As the numerous creeks, bays, and lagoons in that country rendered the smuggling of supplies from it to the enemy so very easy, the whole question of supply to that region of goods which might possibly be used for the Rebel Army was put into the hands of that Commission, and it was their duty to supply the planters, who chose to carry on their plantations, at fair market prices, in order that permits might not be continually
asked for supplies to that country, which might be forwarded to the Rebels.
I speak from memory, but something like three quarters of a million of dollars worth of personal property was taken possession of by the Commission. Plantations were leased, laborers were sent back on them, supplies were furnished to a large amount, and the whole affair was in course of successful experiment when I was relieved.
It was never intended that the property so taken and held in trust by the Commission should be put into the hands of, or mingled with the Quarter Masters' funds of the Department, but was to be held for the purpose of being paid over to the claimant when he should come forward, if found to be entitled thereto, and only that which should be found, after proper adjudication, to belong to the United States, after paying expenses should be turned over to the Quarter Masters' Department. By this means each claim could be properly ascertained in regard to the amount which should be paid. No injustice could be done to any party. The Commission could then adjudicate on the spot with all the evidence before them, and all the means of investigation around them, and would then have in their possession, the precise money which was received for the property sold for the party claimant, or for the United States. Many hearings were had, much property restored, and in some cases appeals were made from the decision of the Commission to the Commanding General, and were heard and decided by him.
But upon General Banks taking command of the Department of the Gulf, apparently without investigation into the subject, and certainly without any conference with the General whom he relieved, but who offered him every facility and every means of information in his power, the assets of the Commission were ordered to be turned over to the Chief Quarter Master of the Department and mingled with the Quarter Master's funds, and spent for the use of the Army, so that now, the claims, many of them just, because the property was not taken under any claims of confiscation, but only for the preservation of the rights of loyal citizens, as well as those of the United States, come under the Treasury, and are to be adjudicated at Washington. It will be therefore necessary that the books and accounts of that Commission should be forwarded to the War Office, and placed in the hands of whoever shall attempt to adjudicate them, and I would respectfully suggest
that the Commission of proper officers of the Department of the Gulf be ordered to forward their books, papers, and fixtures, and all their proceedings to the War Department. But in event that cannot be done I will endeavor to supply the omission.
Fearing that it might be necessary at some time to re-examine all those questions, and wishing to protect themselves against possibility of misunderstanding, one of the gentlemen connected with the Commission took the precaution to take duplicate copies of all papers and books, so that if there is not means of doing justice as well to the claimants as to the United States at the War Office, we have the means. At the War Office we have the means of ascertaining every fact up to the day we left, when the Chairman of the Commission turned over three hundred and fifty odd thousand dollars to the Quarter Master of the Department, most of which I doubt not belongs to some of the residents of the Lafourche District. I have, by telegraph, tendered those copies, with the gentleman who made them and who knows all about the affair, having acted as clerk of the Commission, to the Solicitor of the War Department for his use, and they will be at his services whenever he desires them.
Permit me in closing to say that I hope the affairs of the Commission up to 15th Dec. 1862 will be examined with the utmost scrutiny, care, and discrimination. After that date I have no interest in it, or care whether it is investigated or not, presuming it was all done right afterwards, as I believe it was judicially and properly carried on before that time. I have the honor to be very respectfully,

Major General Peck
Sir: I have fully examined the papers sent to me by you relating to the seizure of the schooner ""Sample,"" and have also read the remarks and strictures made by the Chief Provost Marshal, and therewith respectfully return the same.
While it is true that the place where the vessel went is within the lines of our ""trade district"" as established by you and myself, yet it is palpable the schooner ought not to have gone there. The vessel is undoubtedly liable to confiscation for a gross violation of Treasury and Military regulations in going to a point not designated in the clearance. Proceedings will doubtless be had accordingly.
After saying this, it seems to me that a few general observations are necessary. The subject of internal water communication is one of deep interest, in my judgment, to the Military, Naval, and Civil interest of North Carolina. The sounds, rivers, and creeks of the Eastern part of this state are peculiar, and seem absolutely necessary for inter-communication. Let them all be closed against navigation at one time, and the amount of embarrassment and suffering would be incalculable.
The important point to be attained at present seems to be how far they can be navigated and used for purposes of necessary and legitimate trade without benefitting the enemy or injuring our own cause.
It is hardly necessary for me to assert that it is the earnest wish of this agency to co-operate with the Military and Naval
authorities in rendering the trade which is allowed, as clear and exempt as possible from contact with the enemy.
I find in some instances permits have been recently given in an informal way, and contrary to my intentions. Whenever these facts are brought to my notice, however, I take immediate steps to remedy the error and prevent a repetition of the same.
I have just completed a circular letter, addressed to all the Local Treasury Agents in the state as well as to the Collector and other officers in the revenue service, a copy of which I herewith send you for your information. I think you will see that such instructions have been given as will have a marked influence in preventing future violations of trade regulations. I shall expect a strict compliance with the instructions issued.
While it is true that errors have been made on the part of some engaged in the service of the Treasury Department, yet I have no hesitancy in asserting that the services which have been rendered by the different local agencies have been of the highest importance, not only to the Government but to the loyal and suffering people within our military lines. Thousands of needy persons, men, women, and children have been literally fed and clothed through the instrumentality of these treasury agencies. The evidence in this regard is too overwhelming to admit of dispute. It is susceptible of the clearest demonstration that the excellent system by which this humane object has been performed has relieved the Military and Naval Departments of a vast amount of labor, vexation, and embarrassment. While food and clothing has thus been furnished, loyal sentiment has been nurtured and strengthened.
When we come to compare the condition of trade in Eastern North Carolina under the present Treasury Regulations with that which existed eight months or a year since, the change for the better is most palpable. Then it was a matter of notoriety that large quantities of goods and supplies went beyond our lines, occasioned by the irregular and irresponsible manner in which business was transacted. Now, if a few articles only reach the hands of the enemy it creates general surprise. While the Chief Provost Marshal indulges freely in legitimate criticism, and presents in strong terms the faults of one or two officers, it would seem no more than just that he should recollect what has been accomplished for the general interest.
The allusions having a bearing upon those engaged in the
revenue service will be referred to in another official paper which will soon go before you. My earnest desire is that while the rights and powers of each department in the public service shall be scrupulously respected, such a course shall be taken as will insure harmony and concert of action in the future. All the power and influence I have will be exerted to this end.

"April 9, 1864","Washington, April 9th, 1864
My dear Sir: I am this instant in receipt of your letter, for which I thank you. I certainly hope that the steamer from which so many lives were saved from destruction by wreck may have been that spoken by the ""Fulton,"" but we fear it is not.
Your reference to the captain's use of so large quarters on the Flag of Truce boat surprised me. I answered inquiries, ""Why there was so little room for the use of Army officers etc.,"" by explaining how the vessel was occupied -- and supposing the officers of the boat had permission to use so large portion of the comfortable parts of the boat, -- but of course little was left for our returning officers from Richmond.
I had no idea of complaining of abuses in your Department
 -- certainly I should at once, if I felt called on to complain, address you in the few instances. My knowledge of your readiness to ""rule all your affairs rightly,"" and experience of your energy, promptitude, and justice, leave me no reason to pass you by and appeal to a higher command, and Major Mulford certainly had no more room than was absolutely necessary for the transaction of the business he was expected to accomplish.
When I see you I think I can explain some facts connected with the boat it is not now important to state, and which it is probable have led to enquiries here on the part of the Department. I have certainly heard at Annapolis as well as in Washington, severe remarks on the lack of proper care for the invalid and sick returned prisoners, and I have myself taken occasion to say that I openly and fully censured the Hospital, and told Dr. Elliot I could hardly feel justified in not reporting the same to the Medical director.
If it has not been in all respects reformed, I hold myself ready to be called in evidence that it was disgracefully fithy and neglected, and that the steward was totally incompetent though he meant well perhaps. Yours Sir, with faith and good-will,
D. L. Dix"
"April 9, 1864","Hd. Qrs. Dept. Va. and N. C., Fort Monroe, April 9th, 1864
Hon. E. M. Stanton, Secretary of War
Sir: Upon the last Flag of Truce boat which carried up Confederate Prisoners in our hands, I sent up from Point Lookout some four hundred odd prisoners, being the wounded and sick Confederates who were sufficiently convalescent to bear the voyage.
Upon the return of the boat, I was informed by Major Mulford that the Confederate Agent of Exchange would meet me on the James River on Wednesday the -- March. Accordingly I received notice from Admiral Lee, late in the evening of that day, that a Flag of Truce boat was seeking communication at the outer picket line of the blockading fleet, at the mouth of the James River.
The same messenger brought a communication from Robert Ould, Esq., Agent of Exchange of the authorities of the belligerents at Richmond, directed to Major General Butler, Agent for the Exchange of Prisoners on behalf of the United States, signed with the official Signature of ""Robert Ould,
Agent of Exchange Confederate States,"" informing me that he was then on board of the Confederate States Steamer ""Roanoke,"" and desired an interview upon the subject of exchange.
Deeming this to be an official recognition of the Commissioner of Exchange of the United States, on behalf of the belligerent authorities at Richmond, and an abnegation of the letter to General Hitchcock, Commissioner of Exchange of the date, Dec. 27th, 1863, refusing to treat with myself as Commissioner of Exchange on the part of the United States, I sent Major Mulford with a steamer to officially inform Mr. Ould that I would confer with him as proposed, and suggested as a matter of comfort to both parties that he should meet me with his assistant at Fortress Monroe. Owing to the darkness, and storminess of the weather, he was not able to come down the river until the following day.
Upon meeting, Mr. Ould informed me that most of the soldiers of the United States in the hands of his authorities had been sent to Americus, Ga., for the convenience of furnishing them with food, and for the purpose of relieving us from the temptations of continual movements upon Richmond for the purpose of their liberation, and that in further exchange he would desire to have these prisoners delivered to us at Fort Pulaski, in Savannah River, and urged as a reason that it was more desirable to have them come by sea than to suffer the discomforts of a ride of many hundred miles by railroad. From motives of tenderness to the prisoners, and to prevent their being broken down by the journey, I assented that in case the exchange went forward our Government would receive those prisoners at that point, although the expenditure would be much heavier than at City Point; but leaving that question as well as the other, whether the prisoners held by us in the West might not be delivered somewhere on the Mississippi River, and thus save an expensive land transportation, to be adjusted by future conference, after other questions of more moment were settled.
We then proceeded to discuss the points of difference which had arisen in the matter of Exchange, and the points reduced themselves to a few, which for more convenience for reference were put in a memorandum, a copy of which is herewith enclosed. I confess that, excepting the first point, as to persons of color, which I beg leave to discuss last, I can see no reason why an agreement upon all points of differences cannot be arrived at, upon just and equitable terms.
In regard to the paroles, the Confederate Commissioner claims nothing, so far as I can see, which he is not willing to concede to us, acting under the cartel and our General Orders, with the exception that I believe on both sides it should be yielded that as well before as subsequently to Order No. 207, of July 3rd, 1863, that paroles should not be accepted by either belligerents, of officers or soldiers, who were not so far in the power of the captor as to be taken to a place of safety, and I believe this proposition will be agreed to by the Confederate Commissioner, although for paroles given prior to July 3rd I was at a loss to answer the fact claimed, which I supposed to be the fact, that paroles of prisoners taken on raids had been insisted upon on the behalf of the United States, as in the case of Kilpatrick's first expedition to Richmond, and had been allowed and counted by the Confederate authorities. But I have still no doubt that that matter can be easily adjusted.
The next question of difference that presented itself in discussing what paroles should be allowed, was the necessity of defining what is the meaning of the words ""Commanders of two opposing Armies in the Field,"" as used in the Order No. 207. And this was further complicated with the question when that Order should be considered as taking effect. Whether at its date, July 3rd, 1863, or on the date of its being notified to the Confederate Commissioner of Exchange, July 8th, or at some other period. The practical result of the difference of opinion upon this question would be this: [if] the ""Commanding Officer of an Army in the Field,"" should only mean an officer actually commanding a Military Department, or an Expeditionary Corps, in a given section of country, and the Order should be held to take effect July 3rd, the day of its date, then the Confederate Commissioner claims that the paroles at Vicksburg were invalid, under Order No. 207, which took effect July 3rd, as the surrender was July 4th by General Pemberton, who was not ""Commander of the Army in the Field,"" the Commander of the Dept. being General Johnson, who was then within a few miles, and the immediate superior of Genl. Pemberton, who was not negotiated with in the act of capitulation at Vicksburg. Or if it should be held that Order No. 207 took effect on the 8th of July, the date of its notification to the Confederate Commissioner, then the paroles at Port Hudson would be invalid, because that surrendered on the 9th of July by Colonel Gardner, an inferior officer of the Confederate States Army, in command of a fortified
post simply, who would in no ordinary sense be deemed to be a ""Commander of an Army in the Field,"" he in fact being at that time under the command of General Johnson.
And it was further claimed that upon this point Gen. Banks had himself given a construction as to what was meant by a ""Commander of an Army in the Field,"" by refusing to recognize the paroles of the Colonel commanding New Liberia, who, being a subordinate of Gen. Banks, surrendered to Gen. Dick Taylor, commanding Confederate Forces, and negotiated paroles of himself and men without the consent of his immediate superior, Genl. Banks, who was at that time further distant with the remainder of his Army from New Liberia, where the surrender was effected, than was General Johnson from Port Hudson at the time Col. Gardner, the Commander there, negotiated the surrender of that fortified place, with General Banks. There might be no other cases cited on the side of the United States, but these claims of the Confederate Commissioner will sufficiently illustrate the importance of the question, and the necessity of agreeing, in case the exchange goes on, upon some principle which shall obviate the difficulty, and therefore the definition was suggested which appears upon the point discussed, to wit: That in addition to the general meaning, it ought to include a Commander of a besieging force and the Commander of the fortified place besieged. Also to Commanders of detached forces, acting for the time independently of Head Quarters, either by order, or because of the necessities of warlike operations, where it is in the power of the captor to hold and bring his prisoners.
And it was further suggested that to cover all the cases [sufficiently], both on the one side and on the other, as to the time General Order 207 should take effect, that it should be held to take effect within a reasonable time after its promulgation for the Order to have reached the Commanding Officer giving the parole, which time should be judged of according to the distance from Washington. And I think upon both these points an agreement upon the bases here suggested may be arrived at, so as to settle without further debate the capitulations of both Vicksburg and Port Hudson, and others standing in like cases. In order to prevent any temptation for the capturing party to take along the sick and wounded of the other party, who are not able to be moved, another modification of General Order No. 207 was suggested, to wit: that when the captured party is disabled or wounded,
so that his transportation would endanger life or limb, then his own parole should be respected if he is released.
To prevent the complications which now arise by the unauthorized, sporadic, and ill-judged acts of some officers holding commands in the Rebel forces, I suggested another addition to the cartel which is found as the last point of discussion, to wit: in all cases of condemnation to death, imprisonment at hard labor, or confinement in irons, except upon sentence of death, of any person in the Military or Naval Service of either belligerent, before execution of the sentence the copy of the records of the trial and conviction shall be submitted to the Agent of Exchange of the accused party, and unless a communication of an order of retaliation within fifteen days thereafter be made to the Agent of Exchange furnishing the records, no retaliation for such execution or for such other punishment shall be claimed or executed by the other party.
By this the continual necessity for retaliation [which] because of unauthorized acts of individual officers, and the cruel treatment of prisoners by confinement in irons causelessly or without hearing, might call for retaliation on the other side, can be prevented so that the Confederate authorities and the Government of the United States can both assume the responsibility of any act of this sort before it is committed, and not be called upon after the act is done to either assume, disapprove, or retaliate it.
If all the points of this discussion in the memoranda could be fully settled, and the principle upon which paroles should be allowed on the one side and on the other could be adjusted and faithfully acted upon, I do not see why the exchange under the cartel ought not to go on. The cartel was a very hard bargain against us, but still it is our compact, and I suppose it is to be stood by; the details of these paroles I have no doubt all can be perfectly and satisfactorily settled upon the principle I have suggested, none being claimed or allowed on either side except where officers and soldiers of known and recognized military organizations shall have been captured, provided always that citizens may be paroled and changed for citizens. The question of paroles becomes of less consequence to settle in detail, because after allowing all the paroles of the Confederates claimed by them as now existing on their behalf, and allowing the ten thousand paroled at Vicksburg declared exchanged, which the Confederate Commissioner claims he had a right to declare exchanged under
the cartel to meet an equal number of prisoners actually delivered to us at City Point, which we have a right to declare exchanged, there will then remain a balance of paroles in favor of the United States of some twenty-five thousand men; the Confederate Commissioner claiming to have now in his hands only sixteen thousand paroles.
I would suggest, therefore, that, passing the first question which I now desire to bring to your notice, I have authority to settle and determine all these questions of paroles upon the basis suggested in the ""Points of Discussion"" and in this note, because I think it important to get these questions out of discussion and out of difficulty and settled between the Confederate Authorities and the United States, in order that the only question which shall prevent a full and just carrying out of the cartel shall be the very important one which stands at the head of these Points of Discussion. Because while I do not believe that the good sense of the Country, the justice of the Government, or humanity towards our suffering brother-soldiers in the Confederate prisons, will permit us for a moment to break off the cartel upon any difference arising from any of these questions about paroles, numbers, and details of paroled men, which can be settled upon the basis adjusted in this note, yet I do believe that the dignity of the Government, its right to its self-respect and the respect of other Nations, require us to hold with a hand rigid as iron the point of discussion first presented, and that we shall be justified not only by the judgment of the civilized world, but by the self-respect of our Government and by the consent of all good men, and even by those of our sons and brothers who may suffer in prison because of the stand we take, as well as by our own consciences in refusing for a moment to permit those black men whom we have made free, uniformed and armed, and put in our service, when captured to be treated as slaves.
And I desire therefore that this point of difference between the United States Government and the Confederate authorities shall stand out alone, full justification, if not yielded by them, for setting aside the cartel, because of a gross violation of it by the Confederate authorities. It will be remembered that by the Declaration and Proclamation of Jefferson Davis, of December 23rd, 1862, that all officers commanding colored troops were to be delivered over to the Governors of States to be punished under their laws for inciting negro insurrections, which is a paraphrase for punishment [by] ignominious
death, and that the colored soldiers so commanded were not to be treated as prisoners of war, but were to be turned over to their masters to hard labor as slaves, and that this was substantially the recommendation of Mr. Davis's message to the Confederate Congress, and that an Act was passed substantially in accordance with this recommendation. Now, while it may be conceded as a usage of civilized warfare, that prisoners of war necessarily supported by the capturing Government may be employed by that Government to labor upon public work, yet it has never been, among nations making professions of Christianity, held that captives of war, either by land or sea, could be made slaves. And it will also be remembered that the United States Government went to war with Tripoli and other Barbary powers, in 1804, to force them at the cannon's mouth to repudiate this doctrine. It will be seen that the Confederate Commissioner, however, has so far modified his claim that officers in command of colored troops and free negroes, although both may be serving in company with slaves as soldiers in the Army of the United States, are to be treated as prisoners of war, so that the question of difference between us now is not one of color, because it is admitted now that free black men of the loyal states are to be treated as prisoners of war. But the claim is that every person of color who ever was a slave in the thirteen Confederate States shall not be treated as prisoners of war, but when captured are to be deemed to be slaves, and may be turned over to their masters as such by the Confederate Government.
Now, as the United States Government has by the Proclamation of the President, and by the law of Congress, emancipated all slaves that have sought refuge within the lines of the Union Army, declared that they shall not be returned to their masters, and as men heretofore slaves when duly enrolled in the United States Army must be deemed and taken to be within the Union lines, therefore we have no slaves in our Army, and the question is whether we shall permit the belligerents opposed to us to make slaves of the free men that they capture in our uniform, simply because of their color; because upon no ground of national law, so far as I am advised, can it be claimed for a moment that to any slave from any State when found within our lines any right of property can attach in behalf of his former master; because treating the slaves as property only, his capture by us from a belligerent would give the captor the right of property, the jus disposendi,, and
we have exercised that right by disposition of making him free.
But suppose we had not done so, recapture on land by the Confederate forces, treating them as representatives of a Government, would make the slave as an article of property the property of the Government that captured him, and would by no means replace the title in the former owner.
To use an illustration which has occurred to my mind. Suppose on land we captured from the Rebels a horse, belonging to ""A,"" that here disposed of by our Government is taken into the Government service, and is afterwards recaptured by the Confederate forces, -- would there be any doubt that the property in the animal would have been divested from the original owner ""A"" by the first capture, and come to the United States and given to the Confederate Government by the second capture.
Further to permit this would be a violation of the laws of some of these very Confederate States. Virginia has emancipated her slaves by provisions which no one can doubt must be held, according to every usage, to be operative within the lines of the United States Army. Many slaves are thus made free who are now in our Army, and we cannot of course suffer them to be enslaved by the fact of the capture by the Rebels.
I understand this right to thus dispose of black soldiers in arms to be made a sine qua non by the Confederates, and therefore I take leave to suggest that I may be instructed to settle with the Confederate Commissioner upon further conference with him all points of difference except this, and to declare exchanged numbers equal in either side heretofore delivered and paroled, so that this point may be left standing out sharply alone, and in regard to it, to insist that the cartel applies, as it does apply, to these colored prisoners of war, and that no further exchange can go on by the delivery of prisoners captured until this point is yielded, with the purpose, but not with the threat of exact retaliation, in exact kind and measure upon their men, of the treatment received by ours.
Awaiting instructions, I have the honor to be very respectfully,

General: The vicinity of Smithfield and Chuckatuck are known to be infested by guerillas, who are reported to have boats concealed up those creeks and their tributaries. You are aware that the rebels have an organized system of boat expeditions all along the coast, operating at one time from creeks in Matthews and Gloucester Counties against the Eastern Shore counties, Cape Charles lighthouse, &c.; at another time against the gunboat ""Underwriter"" at Newbern, and now against this ship here. In all these cases they harbor in the vicinity of their operations. This was explained by your prisoner, Acting Master Webb, of the rebel Navy, captured while thus engaged in the Neck counties near Yorktown, where, as in the vicinity of Smithfield, &c., the small creeks are numerous and not accessible to our gunboats.
I respectfully suggest that you send at once a sufficient force to capture these rebels and destroy their boats on the upper creeks, and to co-operate with a naval force to prevent
their escape by the river, which I will send as soon as you are ready. I have the honor to be, general, very respectfully yours,

Hon. Edwin M. Stanton, Secretary of War
Sir: I have the honor to report upon the case of the Rev. Geo. D. Armstrong, upon the complaint made to the Hon. the Secretary of State from Anna Silliman, a sister of said Armstrong, who claims some favor from the Secretary of State on the ground that she visited at the same house he did in 1819.
Without stopping to remark upon the issue of misrepresentations and falsehoods contained in the letter concerning my action, or the idea of the applicant upon what constitutes neutrality, or stopping to inquire what may be her definition of a ""good union neutral,"" I take leave to at once proceed to the facts.
The Rev. Dr. Armstrong having signalized himself some years ago by a book containing an ardent defence of the Christian authority upon which human slavery was established, and having proved conclusively to those whose interests it was to believe that God had ordained that certain men should labor forever for certain others without compensation, did more probably to bring about this war than all his preaching had ever done good. Remaining in Portsmouth after its evacuation by the rebels, I find his house, his society, and his influence more prejudicial to the interests of the United States than would have been a company of rebel cavalry in the same situation. I was somewhat surprised to hear that he took the Oath of Allegiance upon the publication of General Order 49 in December last, but learning that there was a meeting held by some of the leading secessionists and rebels of Norfolk and Portsmouth, in which it was concluded that the oath could be taken to save their property, and they remain in the same vein and heart toward the United States as before the taking of the Oath, the matter was explained.
The next information I had of him was that he not only refused to pray for the President of the United States in his
church but was preventing those that would, saying that ""there were two parties to please here.""
The next thing that was brought to my knowledge of him was that in company with his father-in-law, Charles Reed, coming out of the Provost Marshal's Office, fresh from taking the Oath of Allegiance to the United States, both of them, Reed said to him that he ""should like to spit in the face of the Northern Yankees,"" a remark which would have been innocuous enough in itself, because it could not have made Armstrong more disloyal than he really was, but it so pleased him that he felt it his duty to retail the story about Portsmouth, for the purpose of encouraging others to take the oath in the same spirit; and being a clergyman his example seemed to give a sort of absolution to his flock to commit perjury by being disloyal after taking the oath as he afterwards on his examination admitted himself to be.
Believing his example to be very pernicious, and hoping to bring him to some guide to his duty as a loyal citizen, and having published an order that no man should undertake to teach the people in my Department who was not loyal, I had him examined by my staff officer (a copy of which examination has been printed more or less correctly, and make one of the enclosures to me, a correct copy of which is appended to this report). Not wishing, however, to do Mr. Armstrong any injustice, after giving him some days for repentance and thought, I sent for him and took the trouble to examine him personally upon the main and more objectionable portions of his previous examination, and therein so far from showing any contrition or any repentance of his treason, he insulted the Government of the United States and every loyal man by saying that while true it was that Charles Reed, his father-in-law, had made the declaration ""that he should like to have spit in the face of Northern Yankees,"" he pretended that he took that oath in the same spirit that he, Armstrong, did, and the only excuse for insulting language which Armstrong had caused to be circulated was not in the language of his advocate here, that he was a ""good Union neutral,"" but that it was the natural irritation of a conquered people. I had but one of two things to do, send him South as he desired to be, to preach and aid treason, or to shut him up, and believing it in my power, and knowing it to be my duty, I ordered his confinement. Now, I do not consider that I am bound to feed and house a rebel at the expense of the United States without an equivalent.
Therefore I directed that he should be put to labor, and so made my order. I respectfully submit that this is a matter of police regulation and punishment within my Department for which I am not called upon to account to any other Department of the Government, to any one save my immediate superiors, and I pray the attention of the Hon. Secretary of War that the calling for a report upon each case which takes hours to prepare, solely upon the communications of the sisters, more or less disloyal themselves, brothers, aunts, cousins, uncles, and nephews of the different men we find it necessary to punish here, within our own jurisdiction, makes a draft upon the time of the Comd'g General of this Department which renders his duties exceedingly onerous. While I am always happy to make a report of anything I have done, and only object for want of time, yet the reference of one of these complaints to me which is done in one minute at the Adjutant General's Office takes me hours to answer and prepare the necessary vouchers.
I have the honor to remain, Very respectfully,

. . . . Gillmore will join Butler with about ten thousand men from South Carolina. Butler can reduce his garrison so
as to take twenty-three thousand men into the field directly to his front. The force will be commanded by Maj.-Gen. W. F. Smith. With Smith and Gillmore, Butler will seize City Point and operate against Richmond from the south side of the river. His movement will be simultaneous with yours.
Lee's army will be your objective point. Wherever Lee goes, there you will go also. The only point upon which I am now in doubt is whether it will be better to cross the Rapidan above or below him. Each plan presents great advantages over the other, with corresponding objections. By crossing above, Lee is cut off from all chance of ignoring Richmond and going north on a raid; but if we take this route all we do must be done while the rations we start with hold out; we separate from Butler, so that he cannot be directed how to co-operate. By the other route, Brandy Station can be used as a base of supplies until another is secured on the York or James Rivers. . . .
Should by Lee's right flank be our route, you will want to make arrangements for having supplies of all sorts promptly forwarded to White House, on the Pamunkey. Your estimates for this contingency should be made at once. If not wanted there, there is every probability they will be wanted on the James River or elsewhere. If Lee's left is turned, large provision will have to be made for ordnance stores. I would say not much short of five hundred rounds of infantry ammunition would do. By the other, half the amount would be sufficient.

To B. F. Butler, Maj. Gen. U. S. Army
Dear Sir: Permit a stranger (personally) to you to address you, one who has long desired to do so. I was born in good old Massachusetts, God bless the dear old state, at the beginning of the present century, consequently have seen the Union involved in 3 wars. I have watched with intense interest all our prominent military men in their most important movements, and have always acted politically with the most antislavery party. Am an uncompromising Union man, none more so. Now, what I most desire to say to you is that in my opinion no military man has so faithfully and justly discharged his duties in every case as you have. I know of no Union man who does not agree with me on this point.
There is no man that I think would fill the Presidential chair to the best interests of the nation as B. F. Butler, and I know that millions agree with me, and I hope ""something will turn up"" between now and 7th of June next that will make you the successful candidate. I have no ""axe to grind,"" as I neither desire or ask any office, so I do not flatter or write you from any sinister motive. Gen. Banks' friends are proclaiming for him that New Orleans and Louisiana owe their present prosperity to him. But the foundation of their present condition was not laid by N. P. Banks, and every intelligent man knows it. My prayer is that your future may be as glorious and prosperous as your past military career has been, I should dearly like the pleasure of grasping you by the hand.
Truly and affectionately yours, Thomas J. Moore
P. S. My grandfather was a Captain in the ""Revolution""; from him, when a boy, I learned to love liberty.
P. S. I have just read your answer to the traitor schoolmarm. Also your colloquy with the Rev. Traitor, and most cordially approve your decision in both cases.
Lincoln and many others high in authority are quite too angelic for this devilish rebellion. We need more of the spirit of Andrew Jackson in our men in high places. I still hope and trust you will give both the ""he"" and ""she-devils"" of rebellion their just deserts, which are a rope, lead, or poison. I thought it might possibly cheer your heart a little to know that an old man, a stranger to you, 1500 miles away, held the views in
regard to your course that I have herein expressed. It is a satisfaction to me to write it."

Telegram received. In regard to the question of pardon or respite, I send the extract from the General Order, when approved the order: to wit: ""In the case of Private Charles Crumpton, Co. G, 10 Regt., New Hampshire Vols., it appearing that the accused enlisted as a substitute and received his bounty in payment therefor, then deliberately procured a Rebel uniform with which to aid him in deserting, and did desert from his regiment, and was detected in the act, and when detected attempted to pass himself off as a rebel deserter. No excuse is left for his act, and indeed none is attempted to be given. He has been tried before a general Court Martial, and upon satisfactory evidence, although defended by counsel of his own selection, he has been found guilty. The proceedings, findings, and sentence are therefore approved and confirmed.""
I know nothing which can by any possibility be urged in Crumpton's favor except that he was defended by one Butts, a lawyer who neglected his case, but I examined the record and came to the facts above stated.
Large numbers of the New Hampshire substitutes have deserted from Yorktown yesterday and to-day, some have
gone to the enemy, some are lurking in swamps, and some are attempting to get to Baltimore; they are from the regiments lately at Point Lookout, which I have had to remove from there because I found them colluding with the prisoners and escaping, three (3) having seized a boat and carried off five (5) prisoners.

My dear General: The Court Martial before which my military character has been sought to be damaged, has almost concluded its labors.
One case has been disposed of, the second is about closed. I am very positive the first shows great diligence where neglect was charged, obedience where disobedience was charged, and a just protest in mild terms when disrespect was alleged.
The case arose under an order to send away one of my regiments. It went in less than twenty-four hours from the time the order was received. I gave all necessary orders the instant I received them, and did all the most zealous General could do to carry out Gilmore's orders in spirit and intent. All this I proved.
The disrespect was alleged to arise from not explaining why I had detained a few clerks and orderlies of the regt., of which I was accused -- I protested against the accusation, and intimated that if a report was asked, the falseness of the accusation would be apparent.
The case now on trial occurred six months ago. I ordered a regimental Quartermaster to be shut up in the guard tent for insubordination and repeatedly refusing to obey my orders. Gilmore ordered a court of inquiry in the case six months ago, and after the report told me he was satisfied that I had never intended to disobey any orders of his, under which the Quartermaster alleged he was acting, although it is admitted and proven that not one of these orders were ever communicated to me.
Gilmore ordered the officer away from my post at the time -- six months thereafter. Gilmore orders this Quartermaster to prefer charges against me for shutting him up in a guard
house. The testimony shows that he was not put into a guard tent, but into the private tent of two officers, assistants of the Provost Marshal.
Where are the causeless actions upon which I have been tried? I have a very good division of troops here, experienced troops with good Brigade Commanders, generals of experience, can you not secure their services and thus expedite my removal from a Dept. in which no service to the country can be rendered?
Where you are is the point. We talked the matter over in your office in Boston. I shall be thankful to be elsewhere. With great personal regard, I am,
Sincerely yours, Geo. H. Gordon, Brig. Genl."

Dear General: I have just had conversation of so much interest to you as I conceive it that I hasten to write it for you ""in short hand.""
I have been spending the evening with ""Tom Ford,"" of Ohio. He tells me that within a few days a rumor reached Mr. Lincoln that ""Butler, Fremont, Chase, and Banks were going to make common cause for his defeat in a nominating convention."" Great consternation ensued at the White House. Mr. Webster, Seward's private secy., came down for Ford, -- he was taken direct to see the Pres.
Lincoln said that he did not believe the story as to Chase, but was credulous as to the balance of it. Told Ford that he had been induced to believe that he, Ford, could find out just what Butler was doing in the matter. Ford told him he did not then know, but that he could find out to a certainty by a certain day. By the certain day he had found out to a certainty that you were doing no such thing, and told Mr. L. so.
Mr. Lincoln was greatly delighted, and Butler stock had the greatest rise it has ever had with Lincoln. Ford says that as the result of half a dozen private interviews with Mr. L. on his presidential policy, he personally knows that you never stood so well with Mr. L. I told him that he might tell Mr. L. that Gen. Butler had been heard to say within a month that he was for Mr. Lincoln.
Ford says the thing caused the greatest sweat he has seen in a long while -- that it was amusing, and that his story as to your status set several men who were toadying in various ways almost on their heads.
Pomeroy says it is getting more doubtful every day whether they can postpone the convention -- they are trying. Whatever transpires whilst I am here, I am in a good shape to learn, and of course you will learn also.
Ford is going to the Pres. for me. Says I will have no trouble -- says that in order to get me assigned to you the Pres. may want something from you requesting it. If the Pres. telegraphs you, I will be obliged if you will answer -- give him the best rank you can, and send him on. Or if you will send me such an application in writing, I will have Ford use it.
I know you may have objection to asking favors -- if you
have, don't do it, I can force what I want, but it will be more trouble.
Several things have transpired in two days that I would like to talk with you about but cannot write. I am, in haste,

My Dear General: You dealt so kindly with the suggestions as to the movements which I desired should be made from Fortress Monroe up the James and upon Richmond, and showed so much consideration for the views I ventured to express, that it has occurred to me possible you might, in some slight degree, have bent your plan of campaign to meet those views and wishes, although perhaps the inclination of your more matured judgment would lead you to prefer a movement through North Carolina, of which you at first spoke to me.
Specially has this thought pressed itself upon my mind since I have been called upon to furnish transportation for two millions and a half of rations to North Carolina, which inclines me to believe that a movement is intended in that direction.
If this be so, as I have a very strong opinion that but one co-operative movement with the Army of the Potomac should be made on the south of the James, and fearing lest a desire to oblige me might possibly in some degree have swayed your judgment, I take leave to say to you that any disposition of the troops under my command will be most agreeable to me, which shall, in your opinion, subserve the public service. So that if you think it best to have my troops for the North Carolina movement, do not regard in the least degree my supposed wishes or position, as I shall be most happy to co-operate most heartily in any of your movements.
I pray you, General, to take this note in the exact spirit in which it is meant. I believe fully that but one movement (and that the one I indicated) south of the James, with all the concentrated forces that can be spared, able to fight Lee in the field if we can get men enough, or if not, as near it as we can, is feasible, and so believing, I do not for a moment desire that any thought of myself or its effect upon the extent of my command should stand in the way of such concentration wherever it shall be thought best; this, besides being a duty, is at least but a just return for the kind consideration you have shown me.
I have possessed General Smith with my views as well upon the subject of the movement as upon the number of troops which can be spared from my lines for the purpose, and beg to refer you to him for any explanation you may desire. Believe me,
Truly yours, Benj. F. Butler"

Fortress Monroe, April 15, 1864
Rear-Admiral S. P. Lee, Commanding, etc.
Admiral: As I had the honor to suggest to you in a personal interview in which we had the pleasure of interchanging views upon the subject, -- it is intended to land at City Point and above, on the south side of the James River, below a point called Osborn, a force of from thirty to thirty-five thousand men, with the necessary supplies, artillery, and trains. To this purpose it is proposed to use the Appomattox as far up as Port Walthall as a convenient rendezvous for transports. To move this force will take a fleet of about fifty transports besides some thirty schooners and barges for landing and other purposes. From this position it is contemplated to move along the south side of the James upon Richmond, in cooperation with General Meade's army.
To effect this landing and keep this position, it is expected that the navy will hold the James from above Farrar's Island, and the Appomattox from above Port Walthall, free from all attacks by rebel water-craft, at all hazards, as upon this depends the success, and, indeed, the safety of the expedition. In order to prevent annoyance by the enemy, as well of the transports as the naval vessels, it is proposed to seize and hold Fort Powhatan and Wilson's Wharf, nearly opposite each other on the James, which are supposed to be the only bluffs or high points below City Point from which we can be substantially annoyed by the enemy's light artillery or sharpshooters.
It is proposed to start a flying column on board transports, with means of effecting a landing, and seize Wilson's Wharf and Fort Powhatan, and leave an adequate force there to intrench the same; thence proceeding upwards to seize City Point, and commence landing on both sides of the Appomattox while the navy take and hold Osborn, as indicated above.
The navy will be expected to cover the landings at each of the places indicated, by its guns, and to aid, by a flanking fire, the army in holding its positions until intrenched. As this movement is to be in the nature of a surprise, it will be necessary for the naval vessels to go up with the leading column of army transports with the utmost celerity, so that the several positions indicated may be taken both by the land and naval forces before the enemy can concentrate opposition. The Commanding
General offers the use of the armed boats of the army, being of very light draft, to precede the naval force, and drag the river for torpedoes or obstructions, as their loss (if so unfortunate) would not be so serious as a loss of more valuable vessels with their armament, -- to be, if desired, under your orders.
It is required by the Commanding General of the army that the joint expedition be ready for this movement at a date not later than the 30th instant.
After the landing is effected, in the ulterior operations as well as before, the army will expect to render all the aid and co-operation in its power to the navy, to enable it to clear the river of water craft and obstructions, and to receive that hearty and genial co-operation from the navy which the Commanding General has always had the good fortune to receive from the navy -- such as protecting his water transportation and covering his flanks when lying on the rivers, -- so that the great objective point, the capture of Richmond, may be the joint enterprise of the united services of the army and navy.
I believe, Admiral, I have answered each of the propositions contained in your note of to-day with as much particularity and distinctness as the subject-matter will admit, and upon which, and every point and part of which I would desire to interchange views with you in person, and to do so will hold myself in readiness to meet you when and where you will honor me with an appointment for that purpose.
I desire especially to call your attention to the question whether you can hold the point at Osborn as against the rebel water craft, as that is vital; or whether I shall make provision to aid you by sinking obstructions in the channel, or such other devices as engineering skill shall suggest. I have the honor to be,

"April 15, 1864","Head Quarters, Dept. of Va. & N. C., FORT MONROE, April 15th, 1864
My dear Mr. Nicolay: I thank you for your courtesy in sending me so promptly the record in the case of Capt. Wiegel. He was formerly on my staff and I feel some interest in him. I have examined the findings of the Court without demeaning them, still I do not think that the offense, under the charge of ""conduct unbecoming an officer and a gentleman,"" is fairly made out.
In the popular sense of the term, to quarrel at all is unbecoming an officer and a gentleman, but in the sense of the Articles of War, that conduct is the doing of acts which would render a man infamous, and an unfit associate for officers and gentlemen, such as stealing, lying, cheating at cards, and the like.
This seems to be the case upon examination of the records. Capt. Wiegel met Lieut. Col. Cheeseborough, who was holding the rank of Lieut. Colonel because he was Adjutant General of an Army Corps, but who has since been returned to his Regiment as Second Lieut. and got into some conversation with him about some letter that Cheeseborough had written about his (Wiegel's) family. That then upon some reference to the Secretary of War, Col. Cheeseborough called the Secretary ""a fool and an ass,"" and said he had clerks in his office that knew more about business than he did. Thereupon Wiegel replied, that if Col. Cheeseborough said that, he was a ""liar or a damned liar.""
This appears although the Judge Advocate took great pains to keep it out as irrelevant, although the very question in one of the specifications was whether Capt. Wiegel had sufficient provocation for his words.
Then Wiegel becoming excited, called Cheeseborough a ""dirty loafer,"" whereupon Cheeseborough told Wiegel he was ""drunk,"" which was a false accusation, as was fully proved on the trial. Thereupon Wiegel told him again that he ""lied,"" and used some opprobrious language in the heat of the discussion.
Now, while all this may be unfortunate and foolish, yet I don't think it is such a crime as should dismiss a meritorious officer from the service, in a case where all the members of the Court save one recommend him to Executive clemency, in consideration of his previous good conduct and military services. To these last I can bear witness, because Lieut. Wiegel behaved with great gallantry at Fort Hatteras, landing in the surf, for which act I promoted him to my Staff, and he went with me to the Department of the Gulf. The animus of the prosecution may be seen by the charge against Capt. Wiegel, of his conduct toward one Mills.
It seems that Wiegel was present at one time, in a bar-room, where a toast was proposed ""to the Union, the Constitution, and the Stars and Stripes,"" and one Mills, a Baltimore Union man, so-called, was asked to drink to that toast, whereupon the giver proposed to amend it by adding, ""and Abraham
Lincoln, his Emancipation Proclamation and the nigger, wool or no wool."" This Mills declined to drink, and thereupon the proposer of the toast and Mills got into an altercation, in which the toast-giver got the worst of it, and was thrown upon the floor, whereupon Capt. Wiegel interfered and called Mills a damned Rebel for not drinking the toast, and said he should not strike the man on the floor because he was a cripple, all of which, with the exception of the profanity, I think conduct highly becoming a Union officer and a gentleman. And yet that was made one of the charges against Capt. Wiegel.
If the President will but examine the case and look to the recommendation to clemency of Capt. Wiegel, I am sure he will find no difficulty in disapproving the proceedings and findings.
May I ask a further favor, that you will bring the case to his attention? I am,
Most truly Yours, Benj. F. Butler,

General: I have just this moment received your letter of the 15th of April, brought by the hands of Maj. Gen. W. F. Smith.
You are entirely right in saying there should be but one movement made south of James river. At no time has more been intended. I went to Fortress Monroe for the express purpose of seeing you and telling you that it was my plan to have the force under you act directly in concert with the Army of the Potomac, and, as far as possible, towards the same point. My mind was entirely made up what instructions to give, and I was very much pleased to find that your previously conceived views exactly coincided.
All the forces that can be taken from the coast have been ordered to report to you at Ft. Monroe by the 18th inst., or as soon thereafter as possible. What I ask is that with them, and all you can concentrate from your own command, you seize upon City Point, and act from there looking upon Richmond as your objective point. If you can send Cavalry to Hicksford and cut the rail-road connection at that point, it is a good thing to do. I do not pretend to say how your work is to be done, but simply lay down what, and trust to you, and those under you, for doing it well.
Keep what vessels may be necessary for your operations. No supplies are going to N. Carolina except such as may be necessary for the troops there. I presume the call for vessels is in consequence of the preparations ordered for supplying our Armies after a new base is established. The Q. M. did not know where they were to go; but that he was to have supplies afloat, and supposed they were for N. Carolina. I hope this delusion will be kept up, both North & South, until we do move.
If it should prove possible for you to reach Richmond so as to invest all on the south side of the river and fortify yourself there, I shall have but little fear of the result.
The rains have now continued so long that it will be impossible to move earlier than the 25th, so I will set that date for making your calculations. All men afloat could then be sent up York River, as you proposed, to conceal our real design, if you were not then prepared to move. I am, Gen., Very Truly,

General: Your report of negotiations with Mr. Ould, Confederate States Agent, touching the exchange of prisoners, has been referred to me by the Secretary of War, with directions to furnish you such instructions on the subject as I may deem proper.
After a careful examination of your report, the only points on which I deem instructions necessary, are --
1st. Touching the validity of the paroles of the prisoners captured at Vicksburg and Point Hudson.
2nd. The status of colored prisoners.
As to the first. No arrangement for the exchange of prisoners will be acceded to that does not fully recognize the validity of these paroles, and provide for the release to us of a sufficient number of prisoners now held by the Confederate authorities to cancel any balance that may be in our favor by virtue of these paroles. Until there is released to us an equal number of officers and men as were captured and paroled at Vicksburg and Port Hudson, not another Confederate prisoner of war will be paroled or exchanged.
As to the second. No distinction whatever will be made in the exchange between white and colored prisoners; the only question being, were they, at the time of their capture, in the military service of the United States. If they were, the same terms as to treatment while prisoners, and conditions of release and exchange must be exacted and had, in the case of colored soldiers as in the case of white soldiers.
Non-acquiescence by the Confederate authorities in both or either of these propositions will be regarded as a refusal on their part to agree to the further exchange of prisoners, and will be so treated by us. I am, General, Very respectfully

Sir: Mr. Bond's privilege for selling newspapers was given him as the highest bidder, but with restrictions that he should not raise the price of his periodicals, and he has not done so. You were misinformed upon that point.
I have no doubt of the proposition of political economy that
the tax upon an article is paid by the consumer, that depends on whether there is free trade in that article so as to bring it down to a living profit by competition. But in this case, Mr. Bond sells the papers as cheap as anybody else, but for the exclusive right to sell them pays so much to the United States, and a portion of the profits, which is regulated by his profits. This can be made very plain.
Suppose the rate of interest was fixed at seven (7) per cent. by law, and a given bank should pay a large sum of money for the sole privilege of loaning money which it might well afford to do, would a borrower therefore pay any more than seven per cent. on his loans because by doubling or trebling the business of the bank, it made three times the profits, and could afford to pay one-third of the profits for the privilege and still make a third more?
I shall deal with Mr. Bond very severely if I know of any attempts of his to enhance his prices beyond those charged elsewhere, because of the sum which he pays for his exclusive privilege of selling.
Your communications are respectfully returned, with reference to the endorsements of Capt. Cassel, Pro. Mar.
In reference to the matter of permission to bring books into this Department, that stands upon the same ground as all other merchandise. This being an insurrectionary district, by trade regulations nothing can be sent into it of any sort, for sale, without a permit from my Headquarters, and this regulation exists all over the revolted States, and these permits are always granted upon application of reputable people.

General: I have the honor to enclose herewith the statement signed by Col. Hoffman, which was directed to be prepared by the Secretary of War in your presence last evening; and beg leave to explain, that the last formal declaration of exchange of prisoners, which was agreed to by both of the Agents, was dated June 8th, 1863, and was published in General Orders No. 167.
At that time Col. Ludlow was our Agent of Exchange, and the declaration left us indebted to the rebels, officers and men reduced to privates by rates agreed upon in the cartel -- 12,794 men. Since the date of that declaration, the rebels have delivered to us 18,485 men, making our total indebtedness 31,279. Since the declaration referred to, and soon after it, the tables were turned by the capture of Vicksburg and Port Hudson, which brought the rebels largely indebted to us; in addition to which, there had been delivered, rebel prisoners by us, up to July 25, 1863, 8,359 men, and after that date, 7,191, which, added to the Vicksburg and Port Hudson prisoners, makes a total of 65,182.
Sometime in July, 1863, Mr. Ould, without any conference or agreement with our Agent, Col. Ludlow, announced a declaration of exchange in favor of Lieut-Gen. Pemberton, and a few other officers of high rank, which Col. Ludlow protested against and refused to recognize, because it was contrary to usage, and because we had no rebel officers of equivalent grades in our hands to be exchanged for them; and it was supposed that Mr. Ould acquiesced in the protest, but he subsequently reaffirmed this declaration. Col. Ludlow was relieved from duty as Agent of Exchange, and was succeeded by Gen. Meridith. Not long afterwards, Mr. Ould renewed his mode of action, without any conference or agreement with Gen. Meridith, and made an arbitrary declaration of exchange in favor of a considerable portion of the Vicksburg prisoners, without stating any definite number, but defining them by
certain commanders and Corps, which we ascertained included a large excess over the number of Federal troops who had been captured by the rebels, been returned to us, and were on parole waiting to be exchanged.
Notwithstanding the irregularity of this proceeding on the part of Mr. Ould, his conduct left us no alternative but to make a declaration of exchange in favor of a portion of the Federal paroled prisoners in our hands, and a declaration was made extending to 23,056.
We were then in hopes that irregular declarations would not be repeated by Mr. Ould; but we were disappointed. He made several declarations of exchange, extending to rebel prisoners on parole in the South; all of them without conference or agreement with our Agent.
As I considered this proceeding entirely without warrant from the cartel, and wholly unprecedented in the history of war, I advised, as the Commissioner of Exchange, that we should not follow Mr. Ould's example; and though greatly to our disadvantage, -- in the hope of a return to proper principles, -- no declaration of exchange was made by us, except the first and only one made by Gen. Meridith, while he remained the Agent of Exchange; so that, when he was relieved, we had a good and valid claim against the rebels for a large number of men, I feel very sure amounting to over 20,000, stated by Col. Hoffman from his official papers at 23,213 (vide page 2, statement).
Independently of this claim, we have another, arising from the difference between 9,814 (rebel troops on parole) and 8,223 (Federal troops on parole), being a claim to 11,591 (vide page 2, statement), which number, in fact, should be added to the 23,213, to show the total indebtedness of the rebels to us. . . .

Your note of this date, inclosing copy of Mr. Geoffrey's note to the honorable Secretary of State, together with the reply he proposes to make, is just received. It is rather embarrassing to know how to answer, because to refuse to allow the French to go on bringing out their tobacco would indicate that we expect to use the line of the James River; to permit a continuance will give the enemy information of the very day we make any move from Fort Monroe. Altogether, I think it would be better to say that the time expiring on the 23d instant for French vessels bringing out tobacco, they will be allowed until that time and no longer, until new stipulations are entered into, and which will not be entertained until after the spring campaign is over, or at least shall grant no privileges to enter rebel ports until such campaign is closed. This I give simply as my view. Any other arrangement entered into, with the sanction of the President, of course I shall not oppose.

Dear Sir and Brother: As a frater of the world-wide fraternity, and as the official chief of that order in Iowa, I address you in warm, respectful, and fraternal commendation of the course you have pursued since you entered the Army of the Union. Your Masonic brethren of the West have learned to regard you as the truest exponent of the philosophy of this Mad Rebellion; and with me they have regretted that circumstances have not been so propitious as to place you where your ideas might have ""free course,"" and thus enable the nation speedily to reach that ""consummation"" so ""devoutly to be wished for."" You have been one of our most active history makers, General, and many thousands of your loyal countrymen approbate and believe in you now, and will delight to do you honor by and by -- ""in the good time coming."" As a patriot, I am proud of your career, as a Mason, I love you,
and I invoke upon you the choicest blessings of the G. A. O. T. U., chiefest among which are length of days, health, and largely increased opportunities for usefulness.
I make no apology, General, for thus addressing you. A Grand Master of Masons may approach the highest in station without subjecting himself to unpleasantness, so long as he observes the commonest forms of courtesy. I know not that you will care for my commendation, or that of those with whom I mingle on the mosaic pavement, but it has suited me to write as I have written; and I am so unfashionable as to think that a meritorious and conspicuous ""public servant"" rather likes to hear from one of the ""sovereigns,"" who is capable to ""know whereof he affirms,"" that he has a hold upon the affections of his countrymen which it will be difficult to loosen.
God speed and keep you, General, in knightly bonds and fraternally,

Finding the bridges burnt, I made the detour to Annapolis. Mr. Hare there joined me, and acted as my volunteer aid during the Maryland campaign, went with me into Baltimore when the United States forces took possession of the city, and piloted me to Federal Hill, and did most active service, in bringing the city into a state of order, and at the head of a detachment of United States troops seized the Armory, where were collected a large quantity of arms which were being stolen by the Secessionists and sent to Harpers Ferry, and conveyed the same to Fort McHenry.

Colonel: A question has arisen and will probably often occur which I respectfully ask you to decide. Men who enlisted in 1861, and whose time is now about expiring, wish to be mustered out 3 years from the date of their original enlistment. The question arises whether they should be mustered out three years from date of enlistment, when they began to receive pay and perform their duties, or from the date of their muster, which in some cases was two, six and even nine months afterwards. It seems but right that the soldier should be entitled to his discharge after having really served his three years, and not to be made to suffer for the fault of the government in delaying the necessary forms.

Circumstances may make this course advisable anyhow. I would say, therefore, use every exertion to secure footing as far up the south side of the river as you can, and as soon as possible.

"April 19, 1864","Private. Executive Mansion, Washington, April 19th, 1864
My dear General: I find the following statement floating about the newspapers:
Mrs. J. Todd White, a sister of Mrs. President Lincoln, was a rebel spy and sympathizer. When she was passed into the confederacy a few days ago, by way of Fortress Monroe, she carried with her in trunks all kinds of contraband goods, together with medicines, papers, letters, etc., which will be doubtless of the greatest assistance to those with whom she consorts.
When Gen. Butler wished to open her trunks, as the regulations of transit there prescribe, this woman showed him an autograph pass or order from President Lincoln, enjoining upon the Federal officers not to open any of her trunks, and not to subject the bearer of the pass, her packages, parcels, or trunks, to any inspection or annoyance.
Mrs. White said to General Butler, or the officers in charge there, in substance, as follows: ""My trunks are filled with contraband, but I defy you to touch them. Here (pushing it under their noses) here is the positive order of your master!""
Mrs. White was thus allowed to pass without the inspection and annoyance so peremptorily forbidden by President Lincoln, in an order written and signed by his own hand, and to-day the contents of his wife's sister's trunks are giving aid and comfort to the enemy -- nor least is the shock which these facts will give to the loyal hearts whose hopes and prayers and labors sustain the cause which is thus betrayed in the very White House.
Now, the President is not conscious of having given this lady a pass which permitted her to take anything more than
the ordinary baggage allowed, nor which exempted her from the existing rules of inspection. He certainly gave her no such extraordinary privileges as are above described and implied.
Will you please inform me whether Mrs. White presented to you what purported to be anything more than the usual pass on which persons have been sent through our lines, or which purported to entitle her to carry more than ordinary baggage?
2nd Did she take with her more than ordinary baggage?
3rd Was or was not her baggage inspected?
4th Did she use the language alleged in the above statement?
Your obdt. Servt., John C. Nicolay
P. S. Are such passes usually taken up by our officers? If so, please send me this pass or a copy of it. J. C. N."
"April 21, 1864","Head Quarters Dept. of Va. & N. C., Fort Monroe, Va., April 21st, 1864
My dear Nicolay: I am sorry that you or anyone else should be annoyed with the silly story about the conduct of Mrs. White when she passed through Fortress Monroe. If she had been anyone else but a relative of the President she would have entirely escaped observation. Perhaps the better way to answer the newspaper article which you enclose is to take it point by point, and give you a categorical affirmation or denial of the statement.
To an analytical reader the paragraph contains its own refutation, for it states that she conveyed with her in trunks all kinds of contraband goods, together with medicines, papers, letters, etc., while it is stated in the next paragraph that her trunks were wholly unexamined because of an order from the President to that effect. How, then, can it be known to the paragraph maker what the contents of her trunks were if they never were examined.
It is true, as stated, that Mrs. J. Todd White, a sister of Mrs. President Lincoln, did pass into the Confederacy a few days ago by way of Fortress Monroe. There was no evidence which came to my knowledge or observation at the Fortress that she was either ""a rebel spy or sympathizer.""
General Butler did not wish to open her trunks. This
woman did not ""show him an autograph [pass] or order from President Lincoln, enjoining upon the Federal Officers not to open any of her trunks, and not to subject the bearer of the pass, her packages, parcels, or trunks to any inspection or annoyance.""
Mrs. White did not say to General Butler or the officers in charge there in substance as follows, ""My trunks are filled with contraband, but I defy you to touch them."" She did not say, ""Here (pushing it under their noses) here is the positive order of your master,"" for she had no such order nor any such pass in substance or effect, and had nothing but a pass in the usual form, which the President has given sometimes when he thought proper to allow ladies to pass our lines.
The interview between Gen. Butler and Mrs. White was not other or different from the usual courteous and ladylike deportment which passes when gentlewomen call upon him upon similar occasions. Mrs. White showed no other or different reluctance than usual with ladies to have their baggage examined by revenue and other officers when travelling.
Mrs. White was not ""thus allowed to pass without the inspection and annoyance so peremptorily forbidden by President Lincoln, in an order written and signed by his own hand,"" because there was no such order. I have not the pass or I would send you a copy of it, but I take leave to assure you it was in the usual ordinary and common form, indeed not so peremptory as is usually given by the President when he writes in haste. If I had seen reason to suspect or cause to believe anything wrong in Mrs. White's transit, I should have done as I have done in another case of his pass, with his approbation, detain the lady and telegraph him the fact, and I know nothing which has occurred which should ""shock any loyal hearts.""
I did understand that there were in Mrs White's trunk some bridal presents to a young relative about to become a bride, and as I knew it must have taken so much Southern gold to buy them as they could not have been bought with their currency, and could be of no possible use to the Southern army, I concluded it was a fair exchange, or at least one in which we got the better bargain.
I saw the article in the paper, and authorized a contradiction to the Tribune and Herald, and I am told it was there published. I can't believe that the President has been much annoyed by this foolish story. If he has, it is because he has
not been pounded in that way as much as I have, and got hardened. I have the honor to be,
Very Truly Yours, Benj. F. Butler,

Hon. Gideon Welles, Secretary of the Navy
Sir: In the early Fall of 1862, having occasion to operate up the bayous and through the canals in the La Fourche country, and in the waters of Berwick Bay and the Teche, which were much infected by guerillas, it became necessary that some light-draft boats protected against field artillery and sharp shooters by iron-plating, should be had for that service.
That kind of boat it would have been impossible to have brought from the North. Upon consultation with Admiral Farragut, being possessed of the plating which was left by the Rebels, which was being prepared for the ironclads ""Louisiana,"" and ""Mississippi,"" I determined to take two or three boats, best fitted for that service, and cover them so as to protect the boilers and the men in some degree. I think there were three in all. One of them was called ""Baratania No. 2."" She had been in service in the Quartermaster's Department, and had considerable carrying capacity, with a light draft of water, some twenty-seven inches after she was covered. This boat was the property of Mr. James Taylor, a loyal citizen, who had acted as pilot for us in the Louisiana waters, and had aided us in every way that lay in his power.
Finding him a competent person to superintend the repairs and operations, he was employed by the Quartermaster's Department to do so, and was paid from that Department eight hundred dollars on his accounts, having a balance unpaid of $699.71.
Before she was finally fitted for service, I was relieved, and on the 22nd of December gave him a memorandum note of the transaction, which he has still to show. At the moment of my leaving, he had a just right to his boat, and to be paid her value when she was finished and we took her, and this contract would have been faithfully carried out, as it justly ought to have been on the part of the United States, if I had remained in New Orleans, for I paid my just debts, and those of the Government while I commanded in that Dept., and the Navy Dept. would not have been troubled with the transaction.
After Gen. Banks took command, he turned over the ""Baratania"" to the Navy Department, which finished her repairs, and she went into the service of the Govt. Therefore have I
deemed it proper to address this note to you in order that a truly loyal man should receive his just dues.
If there should be any difficulties in your mind upon this transaction, a note to Rear Admiral Farragut, I have no doubt, will bring such a response as will convince you that Capt. Taylor should be paid.
The Quartermaster Department of the Army of the Gulf refuse to pay this bill now, I am informed, because the boat was turned over to the Navy.
I have had three such boats fitted up, which came into the hands of the Navy, and this one is the only one in which the Navy Department had been called upon to pay anything, or ever will be.

General: I got an item to-day that must be news to you, and ought to be interesting.
Gov. Ford and I had just been in to see the President, and were coming down past the Treasury Dept. when we met Gov. Pierpont, of Va. I invited him to join us in a glass of ale, and the three of us with two other friends went into Markham's for that purpose.
Whilst waiting for the ale, several items were talked over by us, but finally Gov. Pierpont said that he thought Norfolk was the greatest place for villainy in the whole United States. ""Well, Gov., who is the patron saint of the enterprize?"" I asked. ""Oh, Gen. Butler,"" he said; ""he has transported the forty thieves from Boston.""
He told of a firm in Norfolk (I do not remember the name, and dare not make any note in his presence) who were called upon by your officer to know how much liquor they had on hand -- as to the cellar they said ""about fifteen barrels,"" as to the shed they said ""go and see."" And that on examination it was found that there were in the shed about forty bbls. marked ""Cider Vinegar,"" and he said that it had been brought down from Richmond before the war broke out.
He said that the liquor was all seised, on grounds which he stated, -- false returns, &c., & keeping a shop open in violation
of orders, -- and sold at public auction for over fifteen thousand dollars. He also said that in a few days after a Boston firm came in there and opened shop with a stock of about forty thousand dollars.
He said you had no right to tax men in any shape whom the President had concluded to protect under his Am. Proc., &c., &c. And that he had prepared a pamphlet exposing you and your connection with trading in Norfolk that would be out in a week. I asked him if the pamphlet would be anonymous -- he said no, that he was doing it on his own hook and in his own name. He said it would be a document of fifty pages, a little more or less.
I opposed his notion just enough to draw him out -- he unbosomed completely. Just as we separated, he uttered some kind of platitude that I don't remember -- I said you are right there, I agree with, ""Give it to him.""
Gov. Ford, Col. Bruce of Cleveland, O. (a friend of the Gov.'s), and another gentleman whose name I do not know were witnesses to the whole of our conversation. And Gov. Ford is one not unwilling, nor unable to tell the whole truth in regard to it. Of course I do not know how this may be of use to you, or whether it can serve you at all, but it certainly will be worth the reading. I will give you further details when I see you.
The Pres. has this morning referred my case to Holt for an opinion. I'll watch it closely -- get the earliest action -- and I have no doubt as to the result. Mr. Lincoln was pleased with the case -- we had a great deal of sport for an hour that we were with him -- several stories that I'll tell you some time.
I wrote you the other day -- I must beg pardon for not marking it private. At first I thought it unnecessary, as I did not use an official envelope.
If, when we come to that, the Pres. wants an expression from you, I'll ask him to telegraph you himself. I don't care to dictate your answer -- no man could I am sure.

I suspect where this opposition comes from, but am not certain, and I think it is brought to bear upon Wilson, but of this again I am not confident. But this is the shape it puts things, if Gillmore is not confirmed; that you lose the best possible commander you could get for the 10th Corps, as a Brigadier he is junior to Gen.

I was greatly pleased when I heard you were to have two such Lieutenants as Gillmore and Smith, but I should regret exceedingly did I think you were to lose the services of Gillmore, as I should be pained if my friend Gen. Gillmore should be deprived of the reward his services has so justly entitled him to. In addition to anything that may occur to you to do for Gillmore, either to assist his confirmation or to retain him in command of the 10th Corps, allow me to sugest that you write Gen. Grant a pointed note upon the subject. I am sorry we could not have got our Corps to you earlier; but it has been an impossibility. We are pushing things to the utmost. Hoping to see you soon, I am

General: I am exceedingly anxious to concentrate as many troops as possible and as rapidly upon the Peninsula. I look upon the present demonstration of the enemy as made simply for the purpose of preventing such concentration, and therefore I have felt but little apprehension of the result of the movement upon Plymouth. I don't think we can spare,
to hold the posts in North Carolina, the amount of troops that are there. My judgment of the duties of the Government and the necessity of concentration of our forces forbids it. Indeed were I left solely to my own judgment as a military question, I should abandon certainly all but one of our posts in North Carolina, rather than expend the troops in holding them. I send therefore this note to you by my aid, Capt. Shaffer, in order that you may suggest to me what will be the best regiments to form a Brigade for the field, consisting of (4) regiments which can with safety be spared. I wish you also to send me at once the First U. S. Colored Troops. That was only loaned to General Peck upon the supposition that Pickett would attack him with (15,000) fifteen thousand men. Send with this Regiment all the men detailed for extra and other duties; leave not a man that belongs to it who shall not be in their ranks. This is imperative. The fact that they are Quarter Masters and other Clerks must make no difference.
I know it is usual in a General in Command when sending away troops to send the poorest, but I rely upon your patriotism and well-known sense of duty to reverse the rule and send me the best for the field, and I know that our judgment upon that point would coincide.
As soon as we commence operating upon the upper line, you will comprehend that North Carolina will be at once relieved, everything the Rebels have will be brought together to meet General Grant on the line of the Rapidan. I have the honor to be,

Lieut.-Gen. U. S. Grant, Com'd'g. Armies of the U. S.
General: On Monday evening I received a note from General Gillmore, by hand of General Vogdes, who arrived here with two regiments of troops from Hilton Head. The letter contained the following extracts, which are all that are specially material as to the time when General Gillmore will probably be here:
""Brigadier-General Vogdes bears this letter, and it is directed to report to you to take command of the Tenth Corps as it arrives from time to time. Brigadier-General Terry will follow in a day or two, and will then command the corps until my arrival. General Turner will remain a few days longer still, while I do not propose to leave here, or turn over my command of this department, until all my troops are in motion, and the last regiment ready to embark. Great delay has occurred here in concentrating my scattered forces, but it could not be avoided.""
From the tone of his letter, and my conversation with General Vogdes, I am of opinion that he will not be able to be here, or to even get his troops here until at least ten days from to-day. I have directed those troops to assemble at Gloucester Point, opposite Yorktown, under the immediate command of General Vogdes, assigning General Smith to the Camp of Instruction at Yorktown, and the command of the troops on both sides of the river.
I have information, upon which I most implicitly rely, that the enemy have three iron-clads done near Richmond. One, I am informed, but of that I am not certain, is up the Appomattox River, I shall take measures to make certain of that fact. Neither of the iron-clads to be furnished by the navy has yet reported, nor do I believe they will be here for some time. I have some two thousand of my cavalry dismounted for want of horses, although the requisitions have been in a long time, and I have forwarded my officers for the purpose of inspecting them. General Halleck telegraphs me that you will decide whether I shall be filled up, or the other armies, and as you know my needs, I am very well content to abide by your decision. I have no further news from Plymouth in addition to my telegram, save the report of Captain Flusser,
the naval commander there, to Admiral Lee, ""that he needed no reinforcements, but was confident of success"" against the rebel ram. I have the honor to be,

General: I forgot to mention to you a little bit of news which may perhaps be no news to you. It has been in my possession for a long time, and I have communicated it to Mr. B., but did not suppose it would interest you. Some two or three months ago, my friend, Hon. Phil B. Fouke, mentioned to me that he was engaged in a big cotton speculation on the Western waters, and that he and his associates had managed through the agency of the rebel guerillas to procure the ownership of large quantities of cotton on Red River, and that very soon a powerful expedition, combining both the army and navy, would be fitted out to enable them to get out their produce.
The matter had passed from my memory until the Banks and Farragut expedition to Red River was announced. Upon inquiry there I ascertained that it was entirely as Fouke had predicted, Ben. F. Camp and Phil. B. Fouke were the principals, associated with them were Mitchell of the N. Y. Times, the editor of the St. Louis Republican, and some others. It is said that Hooper, M. C., of Massachusetts, furnishes the money, but of this I have not positive information.
However, the expedition was, as you will perceive, purely of a private and commercial character, and not for military purposes other than to enable private citizens to take away from rebeldom the produce which constitutes their only sinews of war. There is in the matter one salient fact. That is that the Navy not only sanctioned, permitted, and connived at the proceeding, but actually employed all its gunboats on the Western waters to carry the expedition out and effect the removal of the produce. What can the hyper-virtuous Mr. Fox say to this? I am inclined to get Jack Hale to bring in a resolution of inquiry upon the subject. Would it be worth while to use the facts?

Have received particulars from the surgeon of the ""Miami."" Ram floated down the river in the night, passed the battery at Plymouth, first discovered immediately under the bows of the ""Miami,"" floating with the current. The ""Southfield"" and ""Miami"" were lashed together. Flusser went forward and sighted his bow-gun, loaded with shell, 10-second fuse; the shell struck the iron-clad, rebounded, and killed Flusser instantly at the gun, one piece cutting his heart out. The ram then went into the ""Southfield,"" and she sunk in five minutes. The ""Miami"" cast loose, and being afraid she would run aground, backed down the river, firing at the ram, with what damage is not known. When ""Miami"" got into the Sound, she came to anchor and sent the ""Whitehead"" up to
see what had become of the iron-clad. The ""Ceres,"" gunboat, took Flusser's body to Roanoke Island, and brought away the surgeon, with despatches for Admiral Lee. In the meantime, the enemy had invested Plymouth, and were threatening an assault. Our last report from General Wessells, in command, was that he was holding out, and the enemy were engaged shelling the town. It is reported Plymouth is captured, but not credited. Ram is 125 feet long, draws 8 feet of water, has two independent propellers, and makes about 4 knots; has two guns, only 20-pounders. She will have done all the mischief she can do, probably, before our obstruction, and your cannon could be ready. Admiral Lee has sent down a gun-boat. I have sent three army gun-boats, under Graham, carrying 30-pounder Parrotts, light-draught and very swift, with orders to Graham to run her down. I think we will get a good account of her yet. Will send your telegram to Graham, with instructions to sink the obstructions if practicable. Surgeon thinks she had not power enough to go up the Roanoke against the current. So far as I can judge, after Flusser was killed no fight was made.

Colonel: I have read your report in relation to your letter to Lieut. Hawkins with emotions of mingled pain and pleasure, and in which the latter largely predominates. While I see in it so many indications of a good officer, I am pained still to think you do not fully appreciate the effect to be derived from an honorable discharge from the United States service.
I would there were a middle ground such as you suggest between an honorable and dishonorable discharge, but there is none. Therefore whoever is not honorably discharged must be dismissed from the service, which is perhaps ex vi termini a dishonorable discharge. To be cashiered is clearly a dishonorable discharge. To be dismissed from the service may not certainly be a dishonorable discharge, as a man may be dismissed for physical disability who refuses to resign.
You will see how difficult is the position of the Commanding General who can only judge from the reports of his officers. Now, I have made it a rule where a party does not resign, never to dismiss him from the service without a personal examination of his case, but where he tenders his resignation upon frivolous pretexts, and then his officers in whom I have confidence, and I beg leave to say from your reputation that I have the highest confidence in yourself, make an unfavorable report either of inefficiency or of any act which shows him an incapable or improper officer, I believe myself at liberty, nay my duty requires, that I should dismiss him from the service, and therefore you will see how much I may be misled by an endorsement made ""in the hurry of business,"" which does not exactly set forth the opinion of the reporting officer, and in this case you see I am called upon to defend my action to the President, because of your action ""in the hurry of business.""

General: . . . . Again last year, when it was very desirable to re-enforce the Army of the Potomac, it was represented to me by army and navy officers that to abandon either of the above-named places (Newbern, Washington and Plymouth) would be extremely injurious to our cause in North Carolina, fatal to Union men who had accepted our protection, and destructive to our flotilla in the sounds. Admiral Lee has frequently represented that his fleet was barely sufficient for the blockade of Wilmington, and we know that even that is very imperfect.

"April 24, 1864","City Point, April 24th, 1864
General: I have the honor to acknowledge receipt of the despatch of the 23rd of April, in which after reminding me that the convention of the 23rd of November, 1863, allows five months only for the exportation of the tobacco belonging to the French Government, you require me to come back with all the vessels under my orders, to the anchorage of Hampton Roads.
Fully recognizing the legitimacy, under the terms of the convention of your request, I have just given orders to the ""Grenade"" to light her fires, and come down the river with the ship she had in tow. I at once stop the work, already commenced, of loading the ""Bidwell"": to this end, I write to stop the loads which are on their way from Richmond and from Petersburg; and, as soon as the engine of the ""Tisiphone"" is in a condition to turn, that is to say, at some time to-morrow probably, I will take in tow the second ship, which is partly loaded, to conduct her to Hampton Roads.
It is my endeavor, General, to call your attention to the fact that I should have been ready to leave this anchorage at the exact hour which ended the time fixed by the convention if I had not been authorized to suppose you had received further orders from your government prolonging the time. My authority for the supposition is the following phrase of a despatch from the Minister of France in answer to observations made by me, and of which I have verbally communicated to you the substance:
""There has been no new convention. The points on which that of the 23rd of November require modification are and will be regulated by direct orders from the State Department to General Butler. It is in this way that I shall cause the delay stipulated in article XVI to be prolonged, and that procedure will be had in all cases not foreseen by the said convention.""
This security of mine will explain to you, General, why I had not my engine in working order at the very moment your despatch was received by me. I am with profound respect, General,
Your very humble Servant,
The Captain of frigate comdg. the ""Tisiphone"""
"April 28, 1864","On board the ""Tisiphone,"" April 28th, 1864 General: I received last night the letter of M. de Geofroy, dated the 21st, which you showed Lieutenant Sequin on the 24th.
I cannot suppose you already had in your hands the letter of the Representative of H. M. at Washington at the moment you sent me, on the same day, a flag of truce bringing me a requirement, made in your own name, to leave City Point because the term of the convention had expired. But, admitting that this letter did not reach you until after the departure of the first flag of truce, I am none the less astonished that this letter of which Mr. Seward, Minister of State, had asked to take charge, for the purpose of sending it to me by special messenger, was not immediately forwarded to me.
You cannot fail to recognize, General, that the dispositions taken on quitting City Point may have been influenced by the fact of my ignorance, and that of the French Consul, of the orders of our Government, which were kept back in your hands, and, I am confident, that you will be so good as to send me, by return of the officer who brings you this letter, such
explanations as will absolutely remove the responsibility from me. I am, with the most profound respect, General,

Captain: The time limited by the convention between the two governments having expired was sufficient reason why His Imperial Majesty's vessels should return from City Point.
I had the honor, when I saw you before you went up, to warn you that your stay could not be prolonged by that time, unless by a new order, and I supposed and expected that you would have returned in time to have been here on the 23rd without further notice, but probably from an imperfect understanding of the language in which the conference was carried on, you did not comprehend the fact that you were so expected to return, therefore when the time expired I sent you a request to return, and that request was in the course of my duty as an Officer of the United States, and relieves you from all responsibility because of complying with it and returning to Fortress Monroe.
At the earliest hour in which you arrived here I forwarded the communications of the representatives of your government copies of these, translations of which were furnished me, and so far as I could understand it, there was no occasion to forward them earlier.

I am absolutely ignorant of what the Richmond newspapers say, and the newspapers of all countries have taught me never to accept their statements without any great reservations.
But I fear I do not correctly understand your letter, for I think I see in it, on the subject of the conduct of my officers, a demand for explanations which it is impossible for me to accept under this form.
Believe me, General, that if any irregularity had occurred of a nature to affect you, I should have informed you of it myself, and that, very far from experiencing at this moment a sentiment of exaggerated or unreflecting susceptibility, I have a lively regret (knowing how easy all explanations of affairs become when they are made face to face, simply and frankly) that I am not yet in a condition of health which would permit me to go and present my respects to you in person.

Brig. General Palmer, Commdg. Dist. No. Car., Newbern
General: I have your despatch of the 22nd, 2 P. M., announcing the loss of Plymouth. I had hoped better things. It is however not right to judge an officer without hearing, and
I wait to hear Gen. Wessells' report. Still, it seems to me that a more determined defence might have been made. The place could not have been taken by assault. It was Gen. Wessells' fault if it was not well munitioned and provisioned, and the Ram was substantially powerless against the land forces; but again I repeat that I don't wish to prejudge.
On the question of holding Little Washington, it is not now nor never was of any strategic importance, and never should have been garrisoned, in my judgment, as I believe I expressed to you when I saw you last November. I do not suppose the naval commander will allow the Ram to get around into the Pamplico Sound, so there will not be the fear of the Ram, but whether Little Washington can stand a siege against all the forces which may be brought against it is a question which I shall leave to your discretion.
If you think it can, and there will be no more surrenders, it may be taken but it never should be surrendered, then you may hold it. You know the necessity we have for troops, and can easily guess why I do not reënforce. Therefore I think the troops that are there will be quite as much of use elsewhere as is the holding of the place.
See to it, if you do evacuate, that you bring away all the baggage and guns, and use your transportations to bring away families and persons who would likely be ill-treated, and who desire to come, and carry them to Beaufort, concentrate upon Newbern, and stand a siege, the longer and more severe the siege, concentrating the larger number of troops upon you, the better. If you concentrate, you clearly can send back the troops that I have sent for.
If upon the whole you conclude to defend Little Washington, you may retain the Light Battery which has been ordered away.
I have known many an officer promoted for a strong, vigorous, although unsuccessful defence; I never have yet known one in any service for a surrender. You may be overpowered, I know you will never surrender.
When there might be some hope of reinforcing Plymouth, I sent down to Roanoke Island the 25th Mass., which I must have back at all hazards forthwith by the earliest possible transportation. You can order it back upon the same transportation that brought it down, to wit, the ""Burnside"" and ""Reno."" Do not detain any transportation which we shall send down to you.
I wish to tell you further for your information that if either Washington or Newbern can hold out fifteen (15) days I shall be in condition to relieve them, perhaps sooner. The inclination of my mind is against holding Washington if it can be evacuated, bringing off all our stores and munitions. Any aid that you mean to give me by the way of troops I must have by the 30th, or they will be substantially useless. I have the honor to be, very respy.,

fulfil the military axiom in regard to a post that it should always be taken but should cost the enemy all it is worth.

Dear Sir: The Second New Hampshire came down from Point Lookout, from whence I had to take them because I was afraid some of the men would collude with the prisoners and escape as they had done.
They were placed at Yorktown, and eighty of them deserted in a single night, principally substitutes under assumed names, like the William Smith alias William Kennedy whose case you suggested to me. They were all caught, and two were shot the next day, and deserting has stopped. I am trying them slowly. I shan't shoot any more unless necessary. I think a man who enlists under the assumed name ought to be shot although his brother may be a very good Republican and voted for Mr. Lincoln in Ohio.

General: I have the honor to enclose the reports of Generals Palmer and Peck upon the capture of Plymouth. It will be seen that Plymouth really fell because the theory of its defences presupposed an occupation of the river by our gunboats, which would cover our flanks. When the Naval force was driven out by the rebel ram, then her fire flanked our defences instead of our fire enfilading the enemy.
So far as I can learn, there was no fighting except artillery firing after the ram got possession of the river, Tuesday morning up to Wednesday 3 P. M., when the surrender was made.
If the reports are correct, it had cost the enemy in men all it gained. The Commander of the Naval forces had expressed the most unbounded confidence in his ability to hold the river, and on this I have no doubt General Wessells relied. I have the honor to be,

Dear Sir: In behalf of the Northern people residing in this city, permit me to ask your consideration of these few lines in regard to the regiment just brought in here to do Provo duty. We understand that they are rebel prisoners. Now, if they had been deserters, then we would have had some confidence in them, but since our residence here we have seen so much of the effects of rebels taking the oath that we feel that they cannot be trusted. And with the almost entire absence of Union troops in this vicinity, we cannot but feel that it would be very easy for this general to admit a Co. of rebels here at any time, who would secure this city, destroying the lives of all Northerners here with a massacre equal to that at Fort Pillow.
I know that business men, teachers of colored schools, and Yankees generally are feeling an insecurity, which has never been felt before since your administration here in this department. On the entrance of this regiment into the city, yesterday, the blinds and windows of the secesh were all thrown open, while the inmates looked upon their march as never before upon a Union Co. This to us is one reason for feeling that they expect to find them like themselves Union outwardly, traitors at heart.
To those who have been here for some time and know of what they speak, there is very little confidence felt in those who have taken the oath. And with this regiment to guard our jails and outposts, must result in a great many leaving for the North who have been established here. I have conversed with a hundred or more, and all express the same feeling. I remain very respectfully,

My Dear Sir: My friend, Gen. Slough, handed me the Norfolk paper, and called my attention to the following:
""We have Gov. Pierpont's ‘History of Virginia,’ which
owing to its indecency, he voluntarily suppressed, and shall publish a digest of it in a day or two, with some observations of our own. It is a very singular work.""
If you have obtained a copy of the pamphlet only from myself, would it not be well to have the remarks of the Editor prefaced with something like: ""We understand that the following is an accurate digest, &c,"" without stating that ""we have"" &c. --
The copy sent was obtained in such manner that it ought not to be traced to myself. If you have obtained a copy elsewhere, please have me informed.
Chaplain, of the N. Y. Herald, who visits me occasionally, told me that he was trying to obtain a copy promised by Gov. Pierpont, and would send you a copy. Gen. Slough told me this A. M. that Chaplain had obtained a copy, but would not let the Gen. see it, as he had promised Gov. P. that he would show it to no one. I can meet with no one possessed of a copy. I am told that Gov. Pierpont says that he was requested by the War Department not to issue it at present.
There is no concealment of the fact that the members of the Cabinet generally are more uneasy about your hold upon the hearts of the people than of aught else. When your friends here assure certain parties that you are not a candidate for the Presidency, and that you are in no wise in opposition to Mr. Lincoln, they are scarcely credited, and yet they see us suppressing as ill-timed at the present local demonstrations in this direction. We do not hesitate to avow our preference, and distinctly affirm that when the time comes we are more than ready to act. But that the friends of Mr. Lincoln and the friends of Gen. B. must be a unit -- that Gen. B's friends can only sustain Mr. Lincoln by his giving Gen. B. fair play -- and that Gen. B. in the right juxta-position, is the least that will satisfy his friends and attract to Mr. L's support, the mass of the radical supporters of Gen. Fr -- t, -- that we don't know, nor wish to know, Gen. Butler's mind, but act simply upon our own convictions and for the public good -- and that Gen. B's friends are too wise and unselfish to allow Gen. B. to be placed in any uncertain or injudicious position.

I have the ""Onondaga,"" and I expect also three Monitor iron-clads and with these I shall be able to co-operate with you as far up James River as their draft and the depth of water will allow them to go; viz: to Trent's Reach, in which there are but eight and one-half feet of water. Our ironclads enter or operate in the Appomattox, but I can co-operate with you in small wooden vessels to Broadway, and, perhaps, as high as Point Rocks, if there are no obstructions in the river, or rifle-pits on the banks to drive the men from their guns on these open deck vessels, or batteries with which such vessels cannot contend. The iron-clads can, barring accidents, average five knots an hour to Harrison's Bar, which is fifty miles above Newport News. They require high water by day to cross that bar. The river at Harrison's Bar, before City
Point, in the Appomattox, and from City Point to Farrar's Island, requires to be examined for torpedoes, and if we meet with no resistance, this can be done by day, and in part of a day.
I thankfully accept the offer of your light-drafts to act under my orders in the performance of this important duty. The engineering device of defense by obstructions (the means of making which you kindly propose to provide) above the iron-clads in James River, would materially aid in preventing the success of attempts to blow them up, and of surprise by torpedo vessels and fire-rafts. The confusion and loss which would inevitably ensue among your numerous transports, crowded in the river, in the event of such an alarm, would be very serious. I would suggest Trent's Reach, or Dutch Gap, as a good location for such obstructions.
I do not see clearly how such a movement can be made a surprise, as the enemy has a signal corps in operation along James River.
I would respectfully suggest that the occupation of Dutch Gap, which is high and narrow, could be a great advantage to us, and that a body of skirmishers, to land, clear, and picket the bluffs on the left bank, between Eppes' Island and Farrar's Island, would be a very desirable protection to the gunboats against sharp-shooters and torpedo operators.
The wooden gunboat force expected is not as large as I have desired; it will, however, I hope, be sufficient to give the convoy required, and assist the iron-clads in covering the landings contemplated.
Be assured, General, that intelligent and hearty co-operation is the first wish of myself, and will be the effort of the officers and men of my command. I have the honor to be, General, Very respectfully,
Your obedient servant, S. P. Lee, Act'g. Rear Admiral"

Dear General: Your letter of the 26th, Yorktown, reached me last night. I showed it to Comstock, who entered into the spirit of it, and during the evening had a talk with the general
upon the subject, though not mentioning your letter. The general is very fixed in letting Butler have his own way with all minutiae. He was so firm in the matter that Comstock and I both think he would decline at once if asked direct to send such staff officer. The general thinks General Butler has sufficient number of able generals to render him all necessary aid to execute the details, and he has indicated his starting point and objective point. I would send your letter to Wilson, but I am sure Comstock has more influence than he (Wilson). The general is quite well. You did not speak of Bowen's being with you. He was ordered some time ago. I hope he is not sick again. Burnside is in his position this morning. Comstock came in from Nashville last night. General Sherman is feeling quite well, and nearly ready. A Captain Montgomery, assistant adjutant-general of volunteers, wished me to ask for a place on your staff. I promised, but knowing you would not want that kind, I have not done so before. No chief engineer yet. Rumor says Halleck is to be the one intended by the President. We have no news. Banks' official reports make out his battle a victory, but it was without doubt a disgraceful defeat the first day. Banks retook three pieces only of artillery.

Major-General Halleck, Chief of Staff of the Army
General: If General Gillmore reaches Fort Monroe in time, and if four of the iron-clads promised by the Navy are also there, our advance will commence on the 4th of May.
General Butler will operate on the south side of James River, Richmond being his objective point. I will move against Lee's army, attempting to turn him by one flank or the other. Should Lee fall back within his fortifications at Richmond, either before or after giving battle, I will form a junction with Butler, and the two forces will draw supplies from the James River. My own notions about our line of march are entirely made up, but as circumstances beyond my control may change them, I will only state that my effort will be to bring Butler's and Meade's forces together.
The army will start with fifteen days' supplies; all the country affords will be gathered as we go along. This will no doubt enable us to go twenty or twenty-five days without further supplies, unless we should be forced to keep in the country between Rapidan and the Chickahominy, in which case supplies might be required by way of the York or the Rappahannock Rivers. To provide for this contingency I would like to have about 1,000,000 rations and 200,000 forage rations afloat, to be sent wherever it may prove they will be required. The late call for one hundred days' men ought to give us all the old troops in the Northern States for the field. I think full 2,000 of those in the West ought to be got to Nashville as soon as possible. Probably it would be as well to assemble all the balance of the re-enforcements for the West at Cairo. Those that come to the East I think should come to Washington, unless movements of the enemy yet to develop should require them elsewhere. With all our reserves at two or three points you will know what to do with them when they come to be needed in the field.
If the enemy fall back, it is probable General Butler will want all the force that can be sent to him. I have instructed him, however, to keep you constantly advised of his own movements and those of the enemy, so far as he can.
General Burnside will not leave his present position between Bull Run and the Rappahannock until the 5th of May. By that time the troops to occupy the block-houses, with their rations, should be out. If they cannot be sent from Washington, I will have to require General Burnside to furnish the detail from his corps. When we get once established on the James River there will be no further necessity of occupying the road south of Bull Run. I do not know as it will be necessary to go so far south as that. In this matter, your opportunity of knowing what is required being far superior to mine, I will leave it entirely to you. Very respectfully,

At the time of the selection he was a volunteer aid on my staff and was acting as Deputy Provost Marshal, and by his action in that office had acquired the good will of and influence with the free colored people. This, together with my knowledge of his energy and efficiency as Major of a New York Regiment in the Spring and Summer of 1861, induced his appointment.
I believe his zeal and energy secured the speedy enlistment of the free colored men in the first two regiments, notwithstanding many embarrassments. He informs me that he has been dismissed the service subject to your approval without a trial or hearing, and without receiving any copy of charges, though he applied for them. I believe him truthful and loyal to the country and administration, and earnest in the cause of colored troops, and that he may be relied on.

General: I have the honor to enclose official copies of the correspondence between Genl. Pickett, Commanding Confederate forces District of North Carolina, and General Peck, Commanding U. S. Forces in said District, in relation to the execution of certain prisoners belonging to the Second North Carolina Regiment.
Many of these men were conscripted by the Rebels, all of them were citizens of the United States who owed their allegiance to the Government. If misguided, they forfeited their allegiance, repented, and returned to it again. They have only done their duty, and in my opinion are to be protected in so doing.
I do not recognize any right in the rebels to execute a United States soldier because either by force or fraud, or by voluntary enlistments even, he has been once brought into their ranks, and escaped therefrom.
I suppose all the right they can claim as belligerents is to execute one of the deserters from their army, while he holds simply the character of a deserter during the time he has renounced his allegiance, and before he has again claimed that protection, and it has been accorded to him. [Thus] by no law of nations and by no belligerent's rights have the rebels any power over him other than to treat him as a prisoner of war if captured.
I would suggest that the Confederate authorities be called upon to say whether they [approve] this act, and that upon their answer such action may be taken as will sustain the dignity of the Government and give a promise to afford protection to its citizens.

Lieutenant Daniel Russell, of the 10th New Hampshire Vols., presents his case to me under the following statement of fact:
He enlisted in the three (3) months' service, and served faithfully and well during that term. Then enlisted in the 19th Mass. Vols., served well through the battles of the Peninsula for ten (10) months down to Harrison Landing. There, was tempted by an older man than himself, he being now but twenty (20) years of age, to desert and go to his home, having, as he alleges and he seems truthful, home-sickness to such a degree as to amount to the disease nostalgia.
After being home two or three months, he came to a sense of his situation, and enlisted in the 10th New Hampshire. Served bravely and faithfully with them, was in the battle of Fredericksburg, and was promoted for good conduct to be second lieutenant, which office he now holds. He has been in actual service of the United States thirty-three and a half (33½) months out of thirty-six.
He is now arrested for desertion. In consideration of his youth, and the strong effect of home-sickness upon youth, his subsequent good conduct, and his evident intention to be faithful to the service, I have released him from arrest, but still cannot prevent his being tried on the charge of desertion to which he must and will plead guilty if it is pressed, as I suppose it will be perhaps from some personal ill-will.
It is therefore respectfully recommended to the President that of his grace and clemency he will issue a full pardon for the crime of desertion to young Russell.

John M. Dunn, Assessor 4th Dist. of Va., Norfolk, Va.
Sir: I have received your note, saying that you are assessing for State licenses for 1864, and further that ""the regulations giving the privilege of bringing spirituous liquors into the city to a few persons only is giving dissatisfaction to many persons, and will reduce the number of licenses and consequently the revenue from this source.""
You then further give me your opinion that restricting the sale of liquors to a few persons will not reduce the consumption, and that you think that all merchants of good standing should have the privilege, and that you are satisfied that I did not make the regulations in the interest of the few.
I have given licenses to twelve (12) persons to sell liquor in Norfolk, they keeping accurate books to whom they sell, and they are held responsible for the purposes to which it goes to the extent of their licenses. If the license is a valuable thing to them, that makes a check upon their actions. I was informed before the order issued that the ""Soi disant Governor"" of Virginia, Pierpont, had complained that the non-granting of liquor licenses in Alexandria by Gen. Slough had nearly bankrupt the treasury of Virginia. I think a state which cannot exist without deriving its principal revenue from the unrestricted sale of poisonous liquors to its inhabitants had better get itself out of existence. If my regulations in this regard should have
that effect upon such a state as I have described, it would be a source of congratulation.
Twelve (12) persons selling liquor at retail, and all respectable hotels selling it to their guests, would seem to be enough in a city of ten thousand and five thousand blacks to engender pauperism and crime, and prevent there being a monopoly, and as you and I agree that the less sold the better, the more restriction thrown around the sale the less will be sold is the universal law of trade.
I have not the personal acquaintance, and prior to the granting of the licenses have never spoken to or seen but two of the twelve persons to whom this permit was given. After the twelve were filled up, one of my warmest and oldest personal friends in trade in Norfolk I was obliged to refuse, because I had fixed the number at twelve. Because of this I have been abused by the supposed Governor of the State of Virginia, in a scurrilous pamphlet which is the only aid I have received from him since taking charge of this Department toward suppressing the rebellion, or in governing a disorganized community.
I have done what I believe to be right in this regard, and neither the opinions of the Assessor for whom I entertain a high respect, or the abuse of the Governor, will be very likely to move me from my position. I have the honor to be,

The attempt on the railroad failed because the enemy resisted with unexpected strength. The place could have been carried probably, but only with a loss which General Heckman did not consider it proper to suffer for this object, and risking the possible annihilation of his command. It is proposed now to renew the attempt with a force that will overcome all opposition. General Heckman reports troops brought in by rail from both directions during the fight. Colonel Dutton and Captain West, who were present, report our troops as most ably handled and behaving with the greatest gallantry. General Heckman and both these officers are confident that the
opposing forces consisted of veterans, and were little, if any, inferior in numbers, their position being one of great strength, although not fortified. Unless you have bad news from the Potomac Army, I think a detail of one brigade from each division in the entire command will be sufficient to make both the feints and real attack. I agree with Colonel Dutton in thinking that a strong feint should be made at the same place, and the real attack elsewhere nearer Richmond. I recommend for the details from this command the brigades of Generals Heckman and Burnham.

My Dear Sir: I must take the responsibility of asking you to bring before the Senate at once the name of Genl. Gillmore, and have his name rejected by your body. Gen.

I directed him to co-operate in a movement with General Smith when he went to make demonstration on the Petersburg Railroad, and he failed to do so, and then sent me word that he did not obey the order for reasons that seemed good to himself, and has not deigned to give me the reasons, although he has sent me a report of his operations, or rather want of operation.

Up to this moment have exceeded my most sanguine expectations. The fleet have lost a gunboat by a torpedo. The
operator shot. Have telegraphic communication with James-town Island.

We have made demonstration today on the railroad between Petersburg and Richmond, and have succeeded in destroying a portion of it so as to break the connection. We have had some very severe fighting to do, but have succeeded. We hear from a rebel deserter and a citizen that Lee is dangerously wounded, Pickett also, Jones and Jenkins killed. We have no news from Gen. Grant. If he has been in any degree successful then can we not have here ten thousand of the Reserve? They can be here in one day after the L. General gives the order. Transportation is at Annapolis for them.
If the Army of the Potomac is unsuccessful, then we want them here for the safety of the country. Please send them forward. Beauregard is in command in operation. In three days our line will be perfect. We have to strongly garrison three points on the river to save our transportation, of which we have a good deal for movable column. All is submitted to your judgment.

Dearest: There has been a variety of things sent you; the last that I know of, a couple of sheets, pillow cases, and the two camp chairs. Mr. Farrington made up a box, and Bennett will go to Baltimore tomorrow night and gather something more. I shall send for the handkerchiefs by him. The tutor will be here in the morning. He has been detained at Baltimore for
three days. The Secretary of War has ordered that none shall pass. Mr. Nichols came down with goods, was stopped at Baltimore, and has gone home to Lowell, waiting for Farrington to send him a pass. You have gone into a tent, -- did you not find it more comfortable aboard the boat? We have no news of any fighting on Sunday, of course; we know nothing of today. Could you write a line a little more frequently? If Johnny Kimball has leave to go home, the two Harriets will go with him. I shall go no farther than Philadelphia and return here. I can ascertain in a fortnight if this man will answer to instruct the boys. If so, he can take them home and I shall remain for Blanche, perhaps longer, that is in the future. What did Kinsman write you this morning? I have several little things to tell you of him, how foolish of me to think you can give any attention to such matters now.
From Shaffer's sending for his clerk I should think you expected to remain where you are. Fisher got a telegram and started directly for New York last Friday. He expects to return here very soon. Webster wrote for a pass, which I sent and wrote him. I would give him the earliest information of your movements that he might join you at Richmond if you have the fortune to get there. Would you like me to come up to City Point and see how you look? Send me a few words of your plans, they govern mine somewhat. I am told the heat is fearful in those tents. You would be better on the boat. You must believe we are thirsting for news.

The army commenced moving south at 9 P. M. yesterday, and when closed up to the position assigned for first day's march will stand thus: General Warren's corps at Spotsylvania Court-House; Hancock's at Todd's Tavern; Sedgwick's on road from Piney Branch Church to Spotsylvania, and General Burnside at Alrich's. It is not yet demonstrated what the enemy will do, but the best of feeling prevails in this army, and I feel at present no apprehension for the result. My efforts will be to form a junction with General Butler as early as possible, and be prepared to meet any enemy interposing. The result of the three days' fight at Old Wilderness was decidedly in our favor. The enemy having a strong intrenched position to fall back on
when hard pressed, and the extensive train we had to cover, rendered it impossible to inflict the heavy blow on Lee's army I had hoped. My exact route to the James River I have not yet definitely marked out.

Lee will be at bay; there must be fearful fighting somewhere. If it comes your way, I pray you to act with caution as well as with determination. No display of personal courage merely will have any weight compared to the glory you will win if your part of the grand movement is carried through without a mistake. I was vexed to hear that you were beyond the pickets and in danger of being ignominiously captured, where you ought not to have exposed yourself. Pray avoid repeating it. You will have danger enough to satisfy you before you have finished the campaign without seeking it in that form. Haggerty is miserable.

Our operations may be summed up in a few words. With seventeen hundred cavalry we have advanced up the peninsula, forced the Chickahominy, and have safely brought them to our present position. These were colored cavalry, and are now holding our advance pickets toward Richmond.
General Kauts, with three thousand cavalry from Suffolk,
on the same day with our movement up James River, forced the Blackwater, burned the railroad bridge at Stony Creek, below Petersburg, cutting in two Beauregard's force at that point.
We have landed here, intrenched ourselves, destroyed many miles of railroad, and got a position which, with proper supplies, we can hold out against the whole of Lee's army. I have ordered up the supplies.
Beauregard, with a large portion of his force, was left South by the cutting of the railroads by Kautz. That portion which reached Petersburg, under Hill, we have whipped to-day, killing and wounding many, and taking many prisoners, after a severe and well-contested fight.
General Grant will not be troubled with any further reinforcements to Lee from Beauregard's force.

the suggestion which you made in your written note, but left me to go to my headquarters under the impression that another and far different purpose was advised by you, I shall not yield to written suggestions which imply a change of plan made within thrity minutes after I left you.

The information I have received from the Army of the Potomac convinces me that our demonstration should be toward Richmond, and I shall in no way order a crossing of the Appomattox for the purpose suggested in your note. If, as I believe, General Kautz has been successful, the communications of the enemy have been cut so far below Petersburg as to render the Lynchburg and Petersburg Railroad useless as a means of communication with the South, and if the Danville road is to be cut at all, it had better be cut near Richmond on the south side, in conformity with the plan agreed upon between the lieutenant-general and myself. Therefore, as early as possible, consistently with safety, you will withdraw your forces from Swift Creek, attempting, in the first place, to destroy the railroad bridge, and then complete a thorough destruction of the railroad as we return to our position, with the intention of making a subsequent early demonstration up the James from the right of our position.

It could not have contained any recommendation from me to change plans, as I did not know what the plan of operation was, further than to cut the Petersburg and Richmond Railroad.

General: I have the honor to acknowledge receipt of your letter directed to General Gillmore and myself, and to reply to it only so far as I, myself, am personally concerned.
Just after you had left yesterday General Gillmore proposed this plan, and it seemed to me to be one worthy of your consideration, as having a tendency to save waste of life to a certain extent, and to more effectually cut the enemy's communications than any infantry force on this side the river could do. I understood you yesterday positively to say that Colonel Kautz was going south on the railroad, which he had already cut. This was, in my mind, a leading idea in giving to this plan the weight which I did. The objections to it were, first, that it would have the semblance of a repulse here; and, secondly, that if we could force our way across the creek, we
would gain valuable time over the other plan. These considerations, which I know would occur to you, were, therefore, unnecessary to mention. The suggestions were made, so far as I was concerned, merely to call your attention to a plan which seemed to me to possess merit. I am happy to state that General Gillmore's idea received the sanction of General Weitzel and Colonel Dutton. I have made this long explanation for peculiar and private reasons, and can only say, in conclusion, that as I have never before been accused of infirmity of purpose, I shall not take the charge as one seriously affecting my military reputation. I had forgotten to mention that the letter was not drawn up or signed by me as a formal protest, but only in a semi-informal manner, and in the quickest time of conveying to you the ideas which had been discussed by General Gillmore and myself. [From] pure consideration for the troops here and the cause in which we are engaged, it becomes my duty to you to express the opinion that the withdrawal from this point must be made in accordance with some well-regulated plan published from headquarters of the army, and not according to the separate wishes and interests of corps commanders.

This request was denied. Later in the evening, upon being informed by General Gillmore that our rear was threatened by infantry and cavalry, I requested General Gillmore to give me one regiment to guard the roads leading to the rear of my lines, stating at the time that I had no regiment that I could safely withdraw from my front, on this duty. Still later in the night, at a time when I thought General Burnham was being driven back, and knowing that the safety of our command depended, in a great measure,
upon that position being held, to save time I sent directly to General Turner, asking him to give me two regiments to aid General Brooks to maintain the position.

Your despatch of yesterday, stating the operations under your command, has just been received, and I have sent it to the Capitol to be read there. I congratulate you and your gallant command upon the skill, energy, and success of your operations. We have nothing direct from the Army of the Potomac later than my telegram of yesterday, but reports say that Lee is retreating and Grant pursuing with his whole army. Despatches from General Sherman state that he has been engaged for the last two days with Johnston's army, and there is reason to hope for a brilliant victory in that quarter.

Gen. Gillmore will order one division of his corps to report to Gen. Smith with two days' rations, ready to march at any time at or after day-light at Gen. Smith's order. Gen. Gillmore will make such disposition with the remainder of this Corps as to hold the enemy in check if any movement is made upon the rear of Gen. Smith, or upon our lines from the direction of Petersburg, holding such troops as may not be necessary to be thrown forward by him upon the turnpike in reserve ready to re-enforce either point that may be attacked. Of course course Gen. Smith's demonstration will cover the right of Gen. Gillmore's line of works, unless he is forced back. Gen. Kautz has orders to proceed as soon as the demonstration of Gen. Smith's troops has marked his movements from, at, or near Chester Station, to make demonstrations upon the Danville Road for the purpose of cutting it.

General B. Bragg, commanding C. S. Armies,
Richmond, Va.
General: Considering the vital importance of the issue involved, and resting upon the success of the plan I suggested to you this morning, I have deemed it advisable and appropriate that their substance should be briefly communicated in writing. General Lee's army, at Guiney's Station, and my command, at this place, are on nearly a right line passing through Richmond. Grant's army is on the left flank and Butler's on the right. Our lines are thus interior. Butler's aim is unquestionably to invest and turn Drury's Bluff, threatening and holding the Petersburg and Danville railroads, opening the obstructions in the river at Fort Drury for the passage of war vessels, and necessitating the return of General Lee to the lines about Richmond. With the railroads held by the enemy, Grant in front and Butler in rear of the works around Richmond, the capital would be practically invested, and the issue may well be dreaded.
The plan submitted is: That General Lee should fall back to the defensive lines of the Chickahominy, even to the intermediate lines of Richmond, sending temporarily to this place
15,000 men of his troops. Immediately upon that accession to my present force, I would take the offensive and attack Butler vigorously. Such a move would throw me directly upon Butler's communications, and, as he now stands, with his right flank well turned toward his rear, General Whiting should also move simultaneously, and Butler must necessarily be crushed or captured, and all the stores of that army would then fall into our hands, an amount, probably, that would make an interruption of our communications for a period of a few days a matter of no serious inconvenience. The proposed attack should be accomplished in two days at furthest after receiving my re-enforcements. This done, I would move with 10,000 more men to the assistance of General Lee than I drew from him, and Grant's fate could not long remain doubtful. The destruction of Grant's forces would open the way for the recovery of most of our lost territory, as already submitted to you in general terms. Respectfully,
Your obedient servant,

General: From the most reliable information I can obtain concerning the reconnoissance made by the rebel General Pickett on Tuesday, the 10th instant, I gather the following: He probably came down from Petersburg in two columns, one composed of two regiments of infantry and six guns by
the river road, near Spring Hill, and the other composed of two regiments of infantry and two guns by the middle road, over Cedar Level. These columns united and formed line of battle about a mile this side of Temple's house, and 2 miles from my earth-works. Contrabands state that General Pickett's line when formed was about twice the length of mine on the day before, when I made a reconnoissance with 1,900 infantry and six guns. Pickett himself made minute inquiries of a contraband whether or not we had lost many men by their shells on Monday on the reconnoissance, and made the remark in the hearing of a contraband that he should not attack the Yankees, but had only come down to gratify the feelings of the People of Petersburg, who were very much excited and alarmed. After remaining in position for about half an hour in my front, Pickett fell back rapidly about dark across Cedar Level. During the day of reconnoissance I was at Fort Powhatan. The enemy did not expose himself at any points to my line of pickets. I am, general,

General Bragg, Headquarters Confederate Armies, Richmond
General: I arrived here by order of General Beauregard on the 13th, having received a telegram to ""come on and confer with him if I could leave Wilmington without danger."" On arriving I found the general about leaving, and received orders to assume command of the department, to make my headquarters where necessary, and to report to the War
Department. I have examined the situation of affairs here and the system of defense. It is my duty to tell you that both are very unpromising -- the latter worthless. The enemy having been permitted to occupy the important position of Howlett's Neck, between the James and Appomattox, with the force he possesses, threatens equally Drury's Bluff and Petersburg. The latter is in great danger because on the north side toward the enemy it has no fortifications, it having been apparently thought that the river would be defense enough, whereas it is an advantage to the enemy.
They have also occupied the Red Bluff and the river from City Point, on the right bank, to the Red Bluff. This is 1 1-2 miles from the city lines, and completely commands the line occupied by our troops on the north of Appomattox, and will give them and their gun-boats a ready entrance to the town when they please. The breast-works on the south side are 9 miles in extent, and of no use as to the enemy's present position and object. It is, therefore, in his power to take this city, with my present force and position, when he pleases, unless he is attacked on his right. His object is undoubtedly Petersburg, the capture of which is easy, and which equally affects Richmond; indeed, would be more serious than the taking of Drury's as well as easier. The massing in front of Drury's is, I think, a feint. They can change that in any one night, and if not instantly attacked on their right can readily force this insignificant line of Swift Creek held by a small brigade and enfiladed from Red Bluff.
They appear to have been established and fortifying at Red Bluff for some days. In my opinion they are only waiting to commence here for the return of their cavalry raid, which, having cut the Danville and South Side railroads, are now approaching the Weldon road. I have positive information that this force is under Spear, and after their previous attack on the Norfolk and Petersburg Railroad crossed over at City Point, and when our forces moved to Drury's, passed by their rear to strike the Danville road. As soon as they return they will command the country and threaten the city lines to the south and east. I expect an attack today, certainly very soon. The force here, about 5,000 present of all arms according to the return, including militia, is not adequate to maintain a position under so many disadvantages, and unless supported it will not be probable that I can save the town -- hardly the troops. I do not think it prudent to accumulate
stores here. I shall do the best I can, but as to the position of affairs I must say that with the enemy on the James and strongly fortified between the two rivers, neither Richmond nor Petersburg can long be held except by force superior to the enemy's -- this place especially.
Very respectfully, W. H. C. Whiting
Major-General
So much for the situation. Now for what we may be able to do. I wish to fight for the place to the last extremity. If pressed in heavy force on the north side of the river, my reliance must be in a prompt and vigorous attack of the army at Drury's on the enemy while I hold them back as long as possible. I hope this will be done and successfully, for the safety of this place is vital to Drury's and to Richmond. The convalescent, sick, and all that can be moved ought to go on return trains to the hospitals in Halifax. They are not wanted here. Surplus stores, if any, must be put at Danville Junction. The South Side road was cut yesterday 27 miles from here. I expect hourly to hear of the line of the Weldon road being again cut -- the raiders moving in a circuit.

Only one note from you, and you have been away nearly a fortnight. Is that quite fair? I had some talk with Col. Falls as I came down. He says that Lee had been making the ground ready for a battle at the Wilderness for the last year, and moved down parallel with Genl.

Eighteen thousand cavalry sent by Genl. Grant had crossed the country and joined you at City Point. Now, you have sixty thousand troops; with that force on one side, and Genl. Grant on the other, it does seem as though Richmond must fall. That order of the Secretary of War should be modified a little. Business men should not be kept from their employments.

If you would write a letter to the Secretary of War urging these promotions I think they would be made. I do not wish to see these vacancies left so long unfilled, lest outside political influences may cause the President to fill them by the promotion of persons totally unworthy. I know that influences have been exerted in favor of a man utterly unfit to hold any commission in the army. After your splendid victories, almost anything you ask for will be granted. The case may be different if you should meet with reverses. I therefore ask that, if you concur with me in the recommendation, you will urge them now. I think you would fully appreciate the importance of doing so, if I were at liberty to tell you who is a candidate for one of the vacancies.

My dear Mrs. Bell: I was delighted on my return from Philadelphia to find your letter waiting me, together with one from Mr. Butler and another from Blanche. You will not be offended if I say yours seemed to belong to, and was equally welcome with the family letters. For the last three years we have known your husband so well, have shared together such perils and triumphs, as makes friendship strong as the ties of kindred.
If this campaign succeeds (as it must though so fearfully bloody on the Potomac), Mr. Butler's headquarters may be at Richmond. In that event there would be but one thing needed to complete his gratification, -- that Major Bell should have his court in Richmond as he did in N. Orleans. No substitute can fill his place; Mr. Butler never expects to receive such aid until Maj. Bell returns to him. It was in N. O., I fear, that his health was injured. I am rejoiced to hear it is steadily improving. We have thought and talked of you so often since you left. The cheerfulness and energy you and Miss Bell showed while worn with anxiety was beyond praise. Mrs. Heard and I looked from our windows onto the ramparts many times after you left, expecting, for the instant, to see your figures flitting by for the daily walk, and turned away sadly to remember that the most pleasant and interesting ones had left us. Mrs. Heard is still with me. Her health is improved but she is not yet well. In a few days she will go North. I shall remain for a time -- I know not how long, but home is too far away, with these battles raging, to seek it now. I must be where I can get the quickest news. The wounded are being brought down to the Fort today and yesterday. Not many in number yet, but tomorrow, well -- I need not anticipate. Tell Maj. Bell that Mr. Butler's
headquarters are in a large brick house about three miles from Fort Darling, almost within reach of the shells; the rattling of the musketry is plainly heard. This I learn from one of the clerks who came down today. I close, dear Mrs. Bell, with thanks for the letter that brings good tidings of your husband's improved health. The sofa-cushion is not a trifle. I shall be so proud and pleased to have such a mark of remembrance, doubly gratifying because you have wrought it.
Mrs. Heard desires to be remembered to yourself, husband, and sister. Miss Bell's flowers that were ""watered with her tears"" have made their acknowledgment by putting forth the most tender and lovely blossoms. Give her my kindest regards and best regards to Major Bell.

Dearest: You have lost your brick house and fallen back five miles. I hope you are strongly intrenched, for if Beauregard is at Fort Darling they will come down upon you. It grieves me to hear of the men being killed, but there is no help for it to some extent. That was a neat thing to put the wires among the trees and throw the rebels in such confusion. They must have lost largely then. Have you received but one note from me? I have written two since my return. Col. Green was here today. He says McClellan, although he dislikes him, praised Genl. Smith very highly. Green thought
he would dig into Fort Darling. He says his wife writes him the people in Boston are very gloomy from the great loss of life on the Potomac. I hope Genl. Grant is really successful; he surely has the better of Lee to some extent. Your courage and hopes are high I know, and need no stimulant, but all that man can command will be needed yet before these rebels are conquered. If one could win these battles by stratagem rather than rivers of blood it would surely be better. Col. Green says we are in the condition of prize fighters, and that side that can bring up men for the greatest number of rounds in the end must win, that it is not war but prize-fighting. He says you have too much sense to throw away your soldiers unless compelled by necessity. This is not what I meant to write, and I have filled the paper all full.

at Hicksford and Stony Creek, where it was obliged to be massed because of the former cutting at the latter place. To prevent Kautz being interrupted or followed until at least he was well advanced, and to concentrate the troops on this command that were marching round from Petersburg, so that they should not re-enforce Lee, I marched my whole column, leaving a force of observation upon the enemy at Petersburg, and made demonstration upon the intrenched lines of the enemy around Drury's Bluff, and remained before them until I learned from the Richmond press that General Kautz had cut the railroad at Coalfield, and had safely arrived at the bridge over the Appomattox. Meanwhile we had assaulted and carried the first line of the enemy's works, which extends from Drury's Bluff over the railroad and around to Manchester. On Monday morning about sunrise the enemy, having received re-enforcements which made them equal to my command, taking advantage of a very thick fog, made an attack upon the right of General Smith's line, and forced it back in some confusion and with considerable loss. As soon as the fog lifted General Smith's lines were established, and the enemy was driven back to his original lines. The troops having been on incessant duty for five days, three of which were in a rainstorm, I retired at leisure within my own lines. At the same time with the attack upon my front the enemy made a heavy attack upon the force guarding my rear from Petersburg, in an endeavor to get possession of my intrenched lines. This attack was handsomely repulsed. We hold the railroad between Petersburg and Richmond. Prisoners inform us that Davis and Bragg were present in person.

Can you send some of your Wiard or other gun-boats, with orders to protect the fleet, and to scour the river for boats, and prevent the planting of torpedoes?

Dearest: I am very much pleased that you missed the letter for yesterday. I did not think you would notice it. Now I shall write not only because I wish to but for the still
better reason that you will be disappointed if I do not. Capt. Martin came today. I have learned from him what I did not before very well understand. I thought from your advancing to Fort Darling that you were determined to attack it, or move on toward Richmond. This, I now suppose with your force would be madness, and that it will require all your strength to remain where you are. Beauregard must be in Richmond, and Fort Darling is but a post of Richmond. It is not strange that they pause a little on the Potomac, I should think there would be a reluctance to renew that sanguinary conflict. These battles are terrible, but delay is useless unless the supplies are wholly cut off from Lee. And the longer Gen. Grant delays the greater is your danger. Judge Abbott's son was buried in Lowell. A very large funeral. I will write no more of these gloomy subjects. How do you make your toilet now? Is your hair nicely perfumed and curled? On the contrary, I am very much afraid you let your beard grow, and that I shall discover your side curls are entirely white when this campaign is over. Poor George, the white curls make me think of him! How his mind would seethe and glow during this time; if living he would surely be here. I look for Fisher tomorrow morning. He will probably go up to you directly. Both the boys creep in with me at night. I began with one, but before morning I found them both. You have not said yet if you want to see me.

President Lincoln
Dear Sir: Filled as I am with the deepest and most painful concern by a letter which I have received today, I hasten to you in my distress of mind as the one most potent to relieve -- and I trust I am not mistaken in thinking you will be ready to remove from me, if possible, the causes of my disquietude.
The enclosed letter, hurriedly written as you will perceive, which was sent under an envelope of the Provost Marshal for Va. & N. C., will explain much that I wish you to know. As for the rest, I can assure you that Mr. Clopton in appealing to me for a vindication of his character as an honorable and truthful gentleman, and one of the kindest and most considerate of masters to his slaves, could not have appealed to one who knew him better. He has been my good and respected neighbor for all my married life, and the terrible treatment he has been suffered to receive I do assure you is most undeserved. Besides this, he is a man advanced in years, and entirely a non-combatant himself. Immediately on the receipt of his letter today I addressed myself to Gen. Butler, presenting such statements in regard to him as I hope and trust will result in his release, and all reparation possible for his terrible injuries.
At the same time I have asked the generous consideration of Gen. Butler for my own case in the terrible difficulties which surround those I left in charge of my household and property, Mr. John C. Tyler, an elderly nephew of my husband, and his orphan cousin, a young lady, both of whom at my urgent request resided at my place to take care of it during my residence with my mother. Mr. Tyler had been a non-combatant during the war, and was most especially a quiet and peaceable citizen. While I had remained at my home it had been so respected by the contending armies that I felt I had nothing to apprehend in the future if upon leaving it for the happiness of being with my dear mother and friends it was placed in the charge of the gentleman I have mentioned, but imagine how greatly I am shocked and distressed to hear that he also has been taken prisoner without the slightest cause, and Miss Tyler, the delicate orphan girl, without her protector, exposed to a fate I dread even to think of. What has become of my home and its treasures, which I left at the mercy of those I ventured to suppose would almost sacredly regard them, I cannot judge, -- but even they are of secondary importance.
I do beseech you, President Lincoln, by the memory of my husband, and what you must be assured would have been his course in your place had your wife appealed to him, remove from me these causes for anxious suspense which are well calculated to agonize a heart of greater fortitude than mine.
Fortunately, I have all my children under my own protection except one, whom I left at boarding school in Va. It is
my prayer he was not at home during the awful scenes that must have prevailed there, though even of that I have not the relief of being perfectly assured.
Repeating again and again my hope in the strong arm of your intervention, I am yours, With great respect,
Julia Gardnier Tyler, Mrs. (Ex. Pres.) Tyler
Bermuda Hundred, May 17, 1864 My dear dear Friend: I have seated myself under most trying circumstances to write you a hurried letter to give you a very concise account of what is going on relative to myself and family and yours. On last week, John C. Tyler was taken prisoner, and Miss Maria came over to my house on Tuesday. After keeping out of the way a day or two I went in to Gen. Wild, commanding a negro brigade at Kinnon's Bluff, and reported, so I might be paroled to remain with my family, but to my astonishment some of my negro women had gone down and told him that I was a most cruel master, and consequently I was stripped and whipped most cruelly by negroes. I was carried to Old Point, where the officers found it out and preferred charges against him, and consequently I am detained here by Gen. Butler, who says I have been badly treated, and he will have the matter investigated. Oh, I wish I could see you a few hours, and your mother and family. I could describe scenes to you truly appalling. My dear wife and Miss Maria, I presume, are at my house entirely alone, not a negro left, -- Andrew and Nelson left with their wives, Louisa was forcibly carried off. I am compelled to close this as the mail is about to close. Please write me a letter stating my general character for truth and as a gentleman, and what sort of master you think I made during your acquaintance with me. I want it to exhibit upon trial -- ask your man and the Col. to join in it, and oblige a friend in distress.

dress extravagance I did not know what honor had been conferred upon me, and I actually have bought a carriage hat of straw, white velvet, and a long white feather. I thought it would but barely answer to grace the taking of Richmond. I will instantly send it home and order it put in the darkest closet in the attic. I have written to Mr. Parton as you desired. Today I talked with Mr. Owen about terms. He said he knew but two private tutors, and they received a thousand dollars apiece a year, and he spoke of what teachers receive in schools, that they have somewhere near that sum. Now, it seems to me in the present state of the country this is more extravagant than matters of dress. Send me your opinion.

I fear there is some difficulty with the forces at City Point which prevents their effective use. The fault may be with

The enemy have evidently fallen behind North Anna. Prisoners have been captured today from Pickett's division, and there is evidence of other troops having been sent from Richmond also. Besides these, Breckinridge is said to have arrived. The force under General Butler is not detaining 10,000 men in Richmond, and is not even keeping the roads south of the city cut. Under these circumstances I think it advisable to have all of it here except enough to keep a foothold at City Point. If they could all be brought at once to Rappahannock or West Point by water, that would be the best way to bring them. They might march across, but if the enemy should fall back of the South Anna this might become hazardous. Send Smith in command, and send neither artillery nor cavalry, unless it is deemed expedient to march over to West Point, thence up north side to join this command.

I am sure you will endeavor that it shall do so, for on that depends success to a great degree. Genl. Smith is prompt and ready for action. His corps have suffered severely. Your force is not sufficient to attack Fort Darling unless Gen. Grant is fighting successfully on the Potomac. Indeed, to hold where you are with this continued attack from the rebels is no easy task. I suppose I have written what I should not, but it is only a woman's view, and woman-like I am not, but I must drop this. Kinsman wants to send more negroes and let them take the place of soldiers in unloading ships or any other work. You will laugh at all this, it is folly in me to write it. I will only add further that you ought (not) to ride at the head of your staff, in sight of the sharpshooters.

What you say in your note of the 20th about the major-generals is correct. There are two vacancies. The law allows five. You filled an original vacancy, and I last year urged Sherman's name for Wool's place; but could not get him appointed. Your promotion makes a second vacancy, and I have urged the names of Meade and Sherman, and Hancock for Meade's place as brigadier. There is some obstacle in the way, and I can't remove it. I am not certain what it is but can guess. Perhaps you will be enlightened a little by knowing what are some of the outside influences. I understand the names of Butler and Sickles have been strongly urged by politicians, in order they say to break down ""West Point influence."" It will not be difficult to draw conclusions. This is entre nous.

The other 2 report that they reached the railroad between the Junction and the burnt mill, and that it is not yet repaired, but that parties were working on it from both directions.

We arrived here Sunday evening, too late to examine the position, and so ascended in the night to Trent's Reach to communicate with Admiral Lee. He has asked for more gun-boats, and says the navy cannot remain above Deep Bottom and Turkey Bend if a determined effort is made by rebels to occupy the shore at those points and cut off supply of coal. He wishes the army to hold position on the north bank of the James at one or both those points. If reconnoissance shows this practicable we should recommend it; but if it is not done the ironclads could be supplied by hauling coal from the Appomattox, and the wooden gun-boats be withdrawn.
General Butler thinks he has evidence that eleven brigades of the enemy are detained in front of him, and estimated to number from 25,000 to 30,000 men. He has captured prisoners from ten brigades within the last four days. On Friday evening captured General W. S. Walker; has his pocketbook with valuable memoranda showing his brigade to number 4,100 men. Petersburg paper of 21st says that three brigades attacked our pickets on Friday night with loss of 600 men. D. H. Hill commanded, and Beauregard was present. A deserter from Ransom's division came in to-day; was at Plymouth and battles near this place; says they have orders to hold the works they have lately constructed in front of us to the last extremity, but does not think they mean to attack. General Pickett went north about May 9, under a cloud for allowing himself to be surprised in this position. General Butler is positive that within the last four days divisions of Hoke, Ransom, Bushrod [R.] Johnson, and Whiting have been before him. We think it possible, however, that very recently, and since our force has been entirely on the defensive, rebel troops have gone to Lee.
The brigades mentioned by General Butler as before him
are Gracie's, Corse's, Clingman's, Hoke's, Walker's, Hunton's, Ransom's, Barton's, Hagood's, Kemper's, Martin's. Wise is here also. General Butler's position is strong; can be defended, when works are complete, with 10,000 men, leaving 20,000 free to operate. We think it already strong, and think if General Grant is engaged in decisive operations that General Butler should not remain on the defensive. We think that this force should not be diminished, and that a skillful use of it will aid General Grant more than the numbers which might be drawn from here.
Supplies of all kinds are abundant; the troops in good spirits. General Weitzel has just been made chief engineer to General Butler, and advises and co-operates heartily. We have not yet been able fully to post ourselves as to the relations of the corps commanders, but think the report of want of harmony may be exaggerated, at least so far as General Smith is concerned. We would prefer taking another occasion to speak on this subject. Will remain here tomorrow, continuing our investigations and awaiting further orders. If it be desired to transfer troops to General Grant, the transportation is in the Potomac and James Rivers. General Rucker and Colonel Biggs can send it here on being notified.

Dearest: Mr. Hale sent me a note this morning. He does not seem to believe much in the danger, though there is plenty of firing, as in the jungle one animal answers to the roar of another, making night hideous. I have no taste for the canes -- never affected Fairs, shall never shine in that line. I never wished to see anything of mine published but once, and then only because it was part of a wild romance in which I had shared, and that suits my nature. I was disappointed in that, and have no desire to enlarge on the common events of life, or post myself as an excellent good woman. If I should ever write a line beyond scribbling to you and Blanche it should be the events of my life, and if I possessed the force of impassioned expression as I have it in feeling, I might a story tell without the aid of fiction. Poor little Buntie! I wrote her a
letter today. I said nothing about the fighting, but described the pretty hat and dress I have bought her, and when I expected to see her. If she thinks I have no fears she will naturally feel easier. I wrote you yesterday that Kinsman was annoyed that you did not notice him. I suppose you intended he should be, and I cannot wonder you feel so, for every little while something comes up, as there did today, that is unbearable. Mr. Farrington said he asked you if it would be well for me to go up, and you replied you had just issued an order for all white women to leave. Is it possible, a swarm of women from Nor. & Port. have been allowed to follow the army? I will not ask you again if you want to see me. I hear you have Genl. Lee's daughter as a prisoner.

What has been done here is, first, to occupy and fortify a strong position as a depot and base; second, to demonstrate upon and occupy a strong force of the enemy, while railroads have been cut and their use temporarily interrupted; third, to collect ample supplies of subsistence, forage, and ammunition. What can be done is, first, to assume the offensive with the object of again cutting railroads, occupy the enemy, and perhaps recalling any troops lately detached to re-enforce Lee with a chance of capturing Petersburg, and a certainty of being prepared to unite with General Grant in the investment of Richmond, or, second, remain purely on the defensive, sacrifice the water communication by the James River for a time, and spare 20,000 men for transfer to the Army of the Potomac. What in our opinion ought to be done is either, first, to place an officer of military experience and knowledge in command of these two corps, thus making them a unit for field operations, and then assume the offensive; or, second, to withdraw 20,000
men to be used elsewhere. General Butler is a man of rare and great ability, but he has not experience and training to enable him to direct and control movements in battle. A corps gives its commander full occupation on the battle-field, and leaves him no time to make suggestions to the commander-in-chief as to the movements of two corps. General Butler is satisfied with the ability and aid of General William F. Smith. He does not appear to be satisfied with General Gillmore. General Butler evidently desires to retain command in the field. If his desires must be gratified, withdraw Gillmore, place Smith in command of both corps under the supreme command of General Butler; let Smith put Brooks in command of one corps, and Weitzel of the other, unless you can send here better officers. You will thus have a command which will be a unit, and General Butler will probably be guided by Smith, and leave to him the suggestions and practical execution of army movements ordered. Success would be more certain were Smith in command untrammeled, and General Butler remanded to the administrative duties of the department in which he has shown such rare and great ability. We are on our way to Washington, touching at Jamestown to forward this despatch, and at Fort Monroe where orders may reach us, if desirable. A deserter today from Colquitt's (Georgia) brigade states that it is reported in the enemy's camp that troops have been detached to re-enforce Lee. He thinks that only about four brigades remain, but that Beauregard still commands. Troops at Wilson's Wharf were attacked by Fitz. Lee, and steamer fired into today. The attack was repulsed.

General Walker, of South Carolina and Georgia troops, was captured on Friday. His brigade consists of 4,100 men, by memoranda found in his pocket. The Petersburg Saturday paper admits between 500 and 600 killed and wounded in the contest with us on Friday, in which it says Wise's, Martin's, and Clingman's brigade took part. It says: ""Our column was under the immediate command of D. H. Hill, but General Beauregard was on the field, and his superior military abilities, of course, contributed largely toward the success of the movements, while his presence inspired the enthusiasm which rendered our men irresistible.""
I have a prisoner from Gracie's brigade, of Anderson's division, of Longstreet's corps, and he says that his brigade is here present. A part of Pickett's division went north before we landed here, leaving Petersburg entirely bare of troops until the remainder came from North Carolina. In a conference with a flag of truce today my officers talked with the brigade and regimental commanders of two different brigades of two different divisions besides those mentioned in the Petersburg papers.

Before the attack Gen.

The James River should be held to City Point, but leave nothing more than is absolutely necessary to hold it, acting purely on the defensive.

Sixty-six officers and men have been captured who were with Hoke in the capture of Plymouth. If Hunter can possibly get to Charlottesville and Lynchburg, he should do so, living on the country.

Sir: Your letter to Col. Fuller, Chief Quartermaster of the Army in the Field, relating to the captain of the ""Thomas Powell,"" has been referred to me, and would have had weight were you not too swift and willing a witness. Such a one usually injures the cause he advocates.
You say that the ""Powell"" was coming up at the commencement of the attack. She did not attempt to come up the river till she had landed her men at Wilson's wharf. There had been some fighting, which had ceased at the time she came up. I have examined the case, and your words to the captain as he attempted to pass between you and the North shore were, ""Get out of my way. Go over to the other shore:"" this both witness and the captain agree in. You now say that you ordered her to go down the river. You will please hereafter give no orders to the army boats. They are not under your control. In the precise language of Admiral Lee, ""My officers are ordered to receive information from the navy officers, but no orders.""
You say that you did not consider it safe for her to pass the enemy's sharp-shooters. Why then did you ask the ""Powell"" as she returned up the river to carry a message to the ""Pequot"" to come to your assistance? Evidently you thought the fight was not over, or you would not have sent for assistance. If it was not safe to pass up just before, how came it more safe to pass up then, when you were sending for assistance?
You farther say, ""I take pleasure in saying that the Captain done all I asked him promptly."" All that you now say you asked him to do was to go down the river, which he seems to have done with great alacrity. You farther say, ""The Captain proceeded up the river as soon as I gave him permission."" The
fact is the Captain was under arrest, tied down in the cabin, before the boat returned up the river, which settles the truthfulness of that assertion. He had nothing to do with the boat's going up the river. And when it was related to you by Major Ackley, the officer in command, that the Captain had refused to go up the river, you said, ""Put him in irons! Put him in irons!"" This was twice reiterated. When informed that the boat had no engineers to go up the river, you said, you would send your own engineers.
You never gave the Captain any permission to proceed up the river. You never saw him after you waved your hand and told him to go up on the other shore. You never said anything about him except, ""Put him in irons!""
You further say in your letter, ""I consider the Captain perfectly blameless."" Why then did you desire that he should be put in irons? Is that the way you order perfectly innocent people to be treated, or is your head cooler now, and do you regret the course which you took then? The course then taken seemed to me a very proper and officer-like one. Of your present course, in this letter excusing an insubordinate transport master, I pass no opinion. It will speak for itself in the light of these facts. These facts I have from the personal examination of the master of the transport.
You are directed in the future not to interfere with the army transports, either ordering them up or down the river. I have the honor to be, very respectfully,

General Grant directs that you retain no more troops than may be necessary to hold the James River to City Point, acting solely on the defensive, and send all else to White House, on the Pamunkey, to land on the north side and join the Army of the Potomac. This column will be placed under command of Major-General Smith. One or two field batteries and a regiment of cavalry will go with it, to cover the landing. General Gillmore or General Weitzel should be placed in the immediate command of your defensive position on the James, as they are familiar with defensive works. General Grant, at noon yesterday, was between the two Annas, and the enemy seemed disposed to dispute his farther advance. Some irregularities in the command at Fort Monroe and Norfolk are reported, the correction of which should receive your attention.

soon as Morrill comes in I will see him. I have read the letter to the gentlemen, and said that in addition to the justice of the desired rejection, you would esteem it a personal favor if their prompt action should relieve you of a nuisance (or a worse thing) as Gen. G. had proven himself to be, so far.
Wade, Chan. Pom. & Wil. were especially glad to hear your request. Chandler said he would have a little executive session and attend to his case. He is already reported against by the Com. I asked them to telegraph the result at once when they had acted. I think they will act promptly and satisfactorily. Just now I have seen Wilson. He says they are engaged very closely on the tax bill, but he will try to get a short Ex. Sess. and have a vote on Gil's case. He is against Gillmore himself, so I think still more than when I wrote above, that the result will be what you desire.
Sen. Chandler was making remarks about Copperheads in the National dining hall yesterday afternoon -- Voorhees of Ind. heard his name mentioned -- approached Chandler and after a few words struck at Chan. The blows were warded off, and some dealt to Voorhees' face. As soon as it became apparent that V. was getting the worst of it a friend of his threw a pitcher at Chandler's head and cut him slightly in the forehead. Farnsworth held Chan. They took up chairs on the Copperhead side. Nobody was badly hurt, but somebody may be yet, as I have heard that Chan. says it is not all over.
I shall now attend somewhat to my own matters. Hoping I may have served you successfully in this matter, & that you succeed as you deserve, I am, sir,

It is a rare occurrence to correct the misrepresentations of the press. I generally prefer to suffer. But a paragraph, extract from which alone, I see in The Herald, has such a tendency to shake the confidence of my command in the officer to whom the Government has seen fit to entrust the direction of the operations here, and as unjust as well to my own reputation as to the reputation of Gen.

You will make such use of them as your sense of right and justice, to which I appeal, may dictate.

Dearest: I thought I should not write today, but the New York papers have stirred me to it; besides, I thought you might possibly miss it if I did not. The Herald takes an article from the Evening Post, and calls on you to defend yourself; of course you have seen all this, and also something in the Tribune. But I wish to know if you think it comes from the source that I think it comes from. You thought Genl. Meigs was satisfied. I think he took his impressions from others rather than you. The words you had with Genl. Gillmore did not make him too favorably disposed toward you. And if Genl. Grant did not succeed in the movement he has since made, or in those he has yet to make, you are a very convenient scapegoat. But I must not write in this way, you will not think it well that I should express opinions on these matters in a letter which may not reach you, nor would you maybe agree with me in the least if I were talking with you. But that article in the Evening Post is not written by a correspondent, but is very guardedly yet explicitly stated as if from authority, and the Evening Post
is a careful paper. Your position is difficult; if you win or lose you are dangerous or obnoxious. Capt. Farquhar came to see me today, -- he looks poorly in health. I am sorry he left you. I think he should have stayed. It was not beneath him to be second to Genl. Weitzel in such a command. He says you were very kind to him about it, and said you would see him again; he thinks you will come down, but I do not think so. I hope you will do any kind thing for him that you can.

In using the words, ""Hold the James to City Point,"" I presume General Grant meant the point you now occupy, above the Appomattox and opposite City Point. No name is given to it on my maps. General Grant undoubtedly means that you are to hold your present fortified position. Advices from Fort Monroe were that there was no officer of sufficient rank in command to control affairs at that place (Norfolk, Portsmouth, Yorktown, and their dependencies), and to secure concert of action; that, to accomplish this, in your absence, there should be a district commander over the whole, acting under your general instructions. No particular irregularities were specified by inspection report. Rebels seem to be making a desperate stand on the South Anna, and General Grant thinks that Lee has been heavily re-enforced from Richmond. General Smith should take every possible precaution in landing on the Pamunkey. Transports ordered here are already on their return.

Dearest: I could not rest easily without sending you a telegram. I think you will understand from it what I wished to say. It related of course entirely to you. I wished to express a word about your going elsewhere, and I do not know but you will leave before a letter can reach you. My letter before this
will give you some idea what I think, though it may not be worth but a moment's consideration, yet, give it that moment. If you go to the Potomac you leave Genl. Gillmore in command, of course with a competent force that must take nearly onehalf. I am writing this believing it rests with you whether you go or stay; if you are ordered to go, that ends it. But if you are, I should want to write to Genl. Grant to ask him why the plans are changed, and your command removed just at the favorable time to attack Petersburg, when you had already given orders for the attack. Do you think a command on the Potomac better than where you are? Capt. Farquhar told me yesterday the army of the Potomac was fully reinforced, that no more were wanted, -- how comes it necessary to divide your force? Do you not look better in the place you were sent to capture and move from than engulfed on the Potomac? I think very much of Genl. Weitzel's opinion if he knows the circumstances. You will think this is all nonsense, and be angry at the telegrams and letter. If you escape sharpshooters, political intriguers, and the poisonous malignity, oh fie, well, if you do, you bear a charmed life.
If you could hold your command complete, now would seem to be the time when you could win glory for the country and yourself, but even divided with a chance to reinforce as best you can, with your active mind in expedients, you could inflict more injury upon the enemy and give greater aid to Gen.

Dearest: I saw those transports go by today (loaded with your troops) with anger and disgust. Every man belonging to your Department is gone. The reinforcements brought by Gillmore, or a part of them, are all you have left. Twenty thousand troops removed, twelve or fourteen left, to hold a point of vital importance! If Lee falls back on Richmond, a Tribune man says he will not fall back there, but get round Genl. Grant and threaten Washington, Penn., Ohio, etc., but whichever way he goes, or if he stands still, and is defeated, it would not be safe politically to leave a force in your hands by which you could capture Petersburg or attack Richmond if there were but a remnant of troops left to defend it. You know that some of us believed before the troops left Yorktown that you would be so closely shorn of command that no possibility of distinction would be left you. But Genl. Grant's belief in your capacity and his sense of justice prevailed for the time, and you were allowed to originate and to direct the capture of City Point; expected to be a most difficult and dangerous movement. But so carefully and adroitly was it strategized that we had possession without bloodshed before the rebels were aware that such a plan was formed, their daring and daily attempts to dispossess us show the importance they attach to it. Now it is fortified, has been examined from Washington, and it is thought you may be able to hold with the force you have left and not enough to make it dangerous you can do more. Your works must be strong if you are able to hold on with that force if Lee can spare a day from Grant. How gloomy you must feel, stripped of command on the hour of movement and in belief of success, only, a man need call for ""patience, patience,"" like old King Lear, when turned forth to the tempest of his inhuman daughters. You will wonder why I write this; because if I write I shall not forget. It will not trouble you. With you the storm has passed already, or will before you get this. The children went tonight. Owen with them. Fisher is yet here -- the house is very lonely. If I had thought you desired them to stay I would still have kept them, but two or three days ago it was very hot and both were ailing, and I was afraid to keep them.

If Gen. Grant needed those troops his condition is very critical. If they were not a necessity, it is determined to make your affairs desperate every way. I hear you have approved that Carney shall send all the vegetables left in the market up to City Point. Will there not be a great waste in that and a chance for complaint? If Dr. McCormick could see what is wanted for the feeble and wounded, and give an order both for there and here too, or Dr. McClellan get a note from you to that effect for the hospitals here, would it not be better? I have sent for fifty boxes of strawberries to be brought this morning at your expense. And shall go over with Parson Cheever to see the wounded soldiers, though I am almost afraid for fear they should address me as they did one woman, with the question, ""Have you come to see the show?""

General: I have information from a deserter from the rebel vessel-of-war ""Hampton"" that the enemy have now below Drury's Bluff three iron-clads, six small gun-boats, plated with boiler-iron, each mounting two guns of 6-inch and 4-inch bore, all fitted with torpedoes, and nine fire-ships filled with combustible material, with which they propose to attack the fleet in James River at as early a moment as practicable by sending down the fire-ships first, closely followed by their iron-clads and other vessels. The deserter says that the vessels have been ready since Monday a week ago, that the crews of the vessels were supplied by men from Lee's army. Information received previously from deserters intimated that the rebel land forces were intended to co-operate with the attack of the rebel naval vessels.

I am no engineer, but still must insist that the bluff near Curtis', which is about 50 feet high, is the place for the 20-pounders to aid the navy. At 5 degrees their range is 2,100 yards. To attack Admiral Lee, the rebels must come around Dutch Gap and Farrar's Island, every foot of which is within 2,000 yards of your guns so placed for more than 3 miles. If a height is not the best position to meet gun-boats, why have the rebels put their battery at Howlett's about 50 feet high instead of at Farrar's Island, where they would be even with the water? Why is a plunging fire ever thought the best? Why build very high castellated forts like Sumter and Calhoun to oppose ships? Rebel General Whiting made a sort of martello tower at Wilmington with logs and sand to resist our ships 60 feet high to mount heavy guns. He was an engineer officer of the army, brought up at the feet of cannon-ball. Under the advice of my chief engineer and in my own judgment I must adhere to the bluff. Gen.

Admiral: Your communication, dated June 2nd, in regard to the obstructions is received. The five (5) vessels sent up were procured by my order for the purpose of being used as obstructions to the river if in the judgment of the naval commander they would add to the security of his fleet. I have no difficulty as to the point at which we desire to secure the river. It is the right of my line near Curtis' house at the ravine, but whether the river shall be secured by obstructions or by the vessels, or a disposition of your obstructions, or by the vessels of your Navy, neither myself or my engineers have any right to feel ourselves confident to give an opinion. The vessels are wholly at your service, but upon your judgment and not mine must rest their use.
In accordance with your request, as I informed your officer, I will visit you this afternoon and designate the spot we desire to be held, but whether by means of obstructions or by your ships or by both combined must be solely for you to determine. While I know you would not undertake to give directions to my engineers as to the situation of our earthworks on land, so we ought not to presume to advise you as to your means of defending the water.
I have not consulted the War Department upon the question whether I should procure these obstructions. I suppose that was fairly within my direction, and I venture respectfully to add that the question whether you should use them is entirely within yours. The Navy Department cannot know the urgencies as you know them, and I am certain must leave that question to the good judgment of the Rear Admiral Commanding the fleet.
I am aware of the delicacy naval gentlemen feel in depending upon anything but their ships in a contest with the enemy, and if it was a contest with the enemy's ships alone I certainly would not advise the obstructions, even at the great risk of losing the river. But in a contest against such unchristian modes of warfare as fire rafts and torpedo boats, I think all questions of delicacy should be waived by the paramount consideration of protection for the lives of the men and the safety of the very valuable vessels of the squadron.
Pardon me if I have overstepped any line of duty or courtesy in the latter suggestion. I have the honor to be,

Sir: I am this moment in the receipt of your letter of May 29th, acquainting me of the enclosure to you of my letter to President Lincoln, and of your having issued directions to the commander of the district in which is my residence on the James River (Charles City Co.) to protect the young lady, Miss Tyler, whom, with her cousin Mr. J. C. Tyler, I left in the occupation and care of it. For your prompt action in this respect I owe you my thanks -- at the time of writing to President Lincoln I also addressed myself to you, enclosing it to the Provost Marshal for Va. and N. C. -- which letter it seems you did not receive. I regret it exceedingly, for I am sure the anxieties I expressed, and the requests I made of you would not have been disregarded. I will therefore take the liberty to repeat them. Sherwood Forest (in Charles City Co.) is entirely owned by me and my infant children, and was being conducted for my benefit under the management of Mr. John C. Tyler, a gentleman who has been exempted throughout the war, and is most especially a peaceable citizen -- attending only to the direction of my affairs in the country where he was taken prisoner. By his absence my property has no protector probably. Also that I left him upon my place in the hope that he would be respected, which hope has been destroyed -- and the young lady I have mentioned would be fearful without his presence to remain an inmate of the premises. My request simply is, that if in your power you will permit Mr. Tyler, who is at present in Chesapeake Prison, to be released and sent back to my home, and for entire inoffensiveness of conduct I know he will give his ""parole d'honneur"" -- and may I also ask that you will issue your orders if anything has been taken from my premises, which if known to you would not have received your countenance, shall be returned -- furniture, family pictures, and books were all left by me, besides a well stocked and well arranged plantation -- upon which also
was a mill for grain -- I believe it is not inconsistent with your duty to protect the widow and the fatherless.
Permit me to say one word in regard to my place in the vicinity of Old Point, which was taken, fully furnished and in beautiful order, at the commencement of the war, and been held in military occupation ever since. It was a piece of property belonging entirely to me, and a recent gift from my mother, over which my husband (Ex. Pres. Tyler) had no control. Should not its value be restored to me according to its original condition? With its loss, and the breaking up of my place on the James by the U. S. troops encamped in its vicinity, but for the shelter afforded by my mother I should be left literally without resources! I am very sure this would hardly occur were you aware of the circumstances of the case. I, therefore, write you frankly what were my hopes and expectations, and have the honor to be, Sir.
Respectfully yours, Julia Gardiner Tyler"

Dear Sir: Your favor of the 25th received, and is satisfactory. Will now proceed to furnish you with the evidence in question.
The whiskey seized by General Butler from Zantzinger and Daniels was purchased here from Jno. Scrymser and Co., No. 124 Front St., in the name of C. H. Pierson, and the bill is dated Oct. 28th, 1863. Said whiskey was shipped on board the schr. ""L. B. Cowperthwaite,"" Capt. Henry Rogers, then lying at the Pier foot of Franklin Street, N. River, on the 31 of Oct. The vessel was cleared from the Custom House on the 31st Oct., and sailed from here Nov. 4th, 1863. The following is a description of the liquor as per bill rendered by Scrymser & Co. A. G. 1 bbl. apple brandy, B. C. 5 bbl. apple brandy, A 3 bbls. whiskey, B 8 bbl. do., C 14 bbls. do., D 40 bbls. do. There was also 4 bbls. whiskey independent of the above lot, making in all 75 bbls. liquor. All the above bbls. were marked (by myself) across the heads with a stencil plate (cider vinegar). Mr. Zantzinger was here and superintended the purchase and shipments of the goods personally, the permit under which these goods were shipped called for 50 bbls. vinegar, only ten of which were shipped, the whiskey being substituted for the balance. (I think Zantzinger has a bill for 40 bbls. vinegar from me furnished for the occasion). There was shipped also at the same time on board the same vessel 1000 sacks salt, when the permits only called for 550 sacks. One permit called for 30 sacks and one for 500 sacks, the balance of the cargo was made up of coal, fish &c. This vessel arrived at Norfolk on the 7th Nov. 1863, and was discharged immediately after her arrival. I am aware that one official received $100 for not seeing anything wrong when the vessel was discharging (shall omit
names). This statement is positive and true. I am willing to affirm to everything herein stated, and accord to the Genl. if he desires the privilege of appending the oath hereto.
Would state further that with the exception of some 30 bblsdot; whiskey, purchased from the Govt. this is the only large lot of liquor these parties ever had in their possession up to the date of seizure, all their accounts of the large lot of liquor mentioned in the evidence is of their own coinage and entirely untrue.
The brigantine ""June Hathway"" landed some 30 or more bbl. whiskey, but who received it I cannot state. The Capt. told me he landed it, also told me of his difficulties with the Comdg. Genl.
As regards Gov. Pierpont's knowledge of what is transpiring in and about Norfolk, Mr. Daniels himself told me that both he and Mr. Zantzinger were continually posting the Gov., and were using every endeavor to effect the removal of Gen. Butler, and hoped some day to be successful.
I hope and believe that the Genl. will observe his word in this matter, and not allow my name to transpire under any circumstance, as it would inflict serious injury on me. I have been swindled by these parties to the tune of $500, which has been the reason of this action on my part. Shall expect to receive the amtdot; 10% on the gross amt. seizure in the course of a few days, after which I may be able to furnish you with some information more important than this (if desired).

Dearest: I think this silence ominous, no firing, no news, -- when you or your troops are lulled into a feeling of security your whole line will be pounced upon, and then with your small force you will be in imminent danger. If Lee gets a
decided advantage of Genl. Grant, he will be upon you before you can get news of it. He knows by this the plan of the campaign, and if you are driven from your hold it is absolute defeat. Grant will be no better situated than McClellan at Fair Oaks. I cannot but fear that we are still far from victory. If Grant is not greatly successful during this week, we have a long and tedious course to travel. Think, while you have the time, note everything great and small, trace back every step of this campaign, see if there has been a blunder made, and what is likely to be Grant's movement from this time out, and where you would be able to strike the best blow if they send you more troops. Talk freely with Weitzel about it as a whole, and in detail. Ideas grow clearer by exchanging with others. He is more able than anyone you have ever had about you. I have a deep misgiving about this whole business. Grant is obstinate and tenacious, he has the bull-dog quality to hold on, and will never give back while he has a force to lead on, and that, it seems to me, is the best hope we have. Your force was wanted and more still if we had them. It does not look so bright as when the campaign opened. But great determination may carry it through yet. I fancy your work is not yet completed. Do you know that your three lines look meagre. If that is the extent of your interest, mine must be a dreadful bore.

"June 5, 1864","Headquarters Armies of the United States, Cold Harbor, Va., June 5, '64
Major-General Halleck, Chief of Staff of the Army, Washington, D. C.
General: A full survey of all the ground satisfies me that it would not be practicable to hold a line northeast of Richmond that would protect the Fredericksburg railroad, to enable us to use it for supplying the army. To do so would give us a long, vulnerable line of road to protect, exhausting much of our strength in guarding it, and would leave open to the enemy all of his lines of communication on the south side of the James. My idea from the start has been to beat Lee's army, if possible, north of Richmond; then, after destroying his lines of communication north of the James River, to transfer the army to the south side and besiege Lee in Richmond, or follow him south if he should retreat. I now find, after more than thirty days of trial, that the enemy deems it of the first importance to run no risks with the armies they now have. They act purely on the defensive, behind breast-works, or feebly on the offensive immediately in front of them, and where in case of repulse they can instantly retire behind them.
Without a greater sacrifice of human life than I am willing to make, all cannot be accomplished that I had designed outside of the city. I have, therefore, resolved upon the following plan: I will continue to hold substantially the ground now occupied by the Army of the Potomac, taking advantage of any favorable circumstance that may present itself, until the cavalry can be sent west to destroy the Virginia Central Railroad from about Beaver Dam for some 25 or 30 miles west. When this is effected, I will move the army to the south side of James River, either by crossing the Chickahominy and marching near to City Point, or by going to the mouth of the Chickahominy on the north side and crossing there. To provide for this last and most probable contingency, six or more ferry-boats of the largest class ought to be immediately provided. Once on the south side of the James River, I can cut off all sources of supply to the enemy except what is furnished by the canal. If Hunter succeeds in reaching Lynchburg that will be lost to him also. Should Hunter not succeed, I will still make the effort to destroy the canal by sending cavalry up the south side of the river, with a pontoon train to cross wherever they can. The feeling of the two armies now seems to be that the rebels can protect themselves only by strong intrenchments, while our army is not only confident of protecting itself without intrenchments, but that it can beat and drive the enemy wherever and whenever he can be found without this protection.

Dear Sir: I send you the enclosed pages, written hastily, and of course without the requisite experience to write a newspaper article.

I wrote this that you may know, for I think you have watched with interest all that relates to him, that Mr. Butler has made no failure as those papers report, but in every point has made decided success. If you can gather
from what I have written anything that might be of use to him without it being necessary to show whence you had it, and your judgment approve it, on that I should rely, for you are cool, and I confess to being somewhat moved, then, you are at liberty to transpose, omit, or make any change you will to render it suitable for the public eye.
Very truly yours, Sarah Butler
Will you be kind enough when read to return the note and manuscript to my brother?
I HAVE read with surprise and a feeling of indignation, which all must feel who look closely to the bearing of things, a series of articles beginning with the Evening Post, that article commented on by the Herald, and calling on Gen'l. Butler for defence, while well aware that an officer is not allowed to make one, no matter how bitter the condemnation or to what humiliation he may be subjected. Next, the Tribune started a weak defence, more to be dreaded (as faint praise is ever more damning) than open hostility. Following that the Herald publishes a long article from a correspondent kindly written, mentioning many officers by name, showing personal good feeling toward them, but by no means a defence to the article in the Evening Post, purporting to be from authority. The Post having struck the keynote, remains silent; while the Herald and Times go on with their work. The last has exhausted its power somewhat, by continued attack, commenced three years ago, while the object of it has steadily and powerfully impressed the great body of people from year to year that he is one of the ablest, farseeing, and comprehensive men that this war has developed. The Herald, having presented the allegation made by the Post, and called for the defence where the party arraigned has no power to reply, proceeds without further deliberation to present him as the immediate and responsible cause of any adversity that has or may happen to Gen'l. Grant, and to deny his capability in every point for his present position. And that the condemnation may be yet more sure and effectual, he also denies it to every volunteer officer in the army -- an assertion insulting and mischievous, but in showing how false it is in the one case the other may fall to the ground with it. Those who look even casually at this
campaign can see that the work is not so easily accomplished as the sanguine expected.
Gen'l. Butler surprised and captured City Point and Bermuda Hundreds to the amazement and consternation of the rebels and the astonishment of our own people, by a strategic move not surpassed during the war. It was done by finesse and celerity. And that it was bloodless entitled it to yet greater credit. Our fearful battles, where blood flows like water and no result obtained, are appalling to nature and fill the country with gloom. Not a moment was lost in fortifying, for it was well understood long before the movement was attempted that the most determined resistance would be made to our holding those points on the James River if we were able to capture them, that if Lee could gain breathing space from Gen'l. Grant he would send a part of his force to retake it, to prevent being harassed by a force in the rear, and at one time but eight miles from Richmond. It is now admitted that what was foreseen as probable did actually occur, that the rebels well knew their danger is evident from the repeated and desperate charges they made to dislodge us. The respite that Lee gained after the great battle of the Wilderness, while our wounded were sent away and reinforcements forwarded, was used to push forward Longstreet's corps to Fort Darling, where, with a larger force, and under cover of a dense fog, they made an attack far more disastrous to them than to us. They lost more men (if we may rely on the Richmond papers). There was no boast of victory on their part, they were compelled to retire, we held the ground, and withdrew to the entrenchments hours after the enemy had left the fight. It was never anticipated that Gen'l. Butler could make a successful stand away from his entrenchments against a part of Lee's army united with Beauregard's, yet it was done, and we had the advantage. If Gen'l. Gillmore had received the order repeatedly sent, and had moved up his troops with the celerity the time demanded, the rebels had suffered a defeat unparalleled in their experience. As it now stands, the enemy have lost more men in killed and wounded for the number engaged than in any contest of the war save that at Baton Rouge. Immediately after landing and fortifying, troops were thrown out toward Petersburg, severe contests ensued from day to day, we gained possession of the rail track and destroyed it for several miles, the lines were cut in various directions, and Beauregard unceasingly held in check for many days after
the battle of the Wilderness; in short, until Lee was able to send Longstreet to his assistance. Gen'l. Butler has done all that he was ordered or expected to accomplish up to the time of the removal of his troops, twenty thousand in number, more than one-half of his command. The order had been given to move on Petersburg the day before they were withdrawn, and with every prospect of success. The two great armies are moving to another encounter, and Lee can no longer divide his force. If they are withdrawn because Gen'l Grant finds a necessity for them greater than to hold Beauregard in check, then the Army of the Potomac has not been reinforced to the extent that is believed, or that the country can command. If they are withdrawn for political reasons, in fear that Gen'l. Butler should meet with further success before the next President is selected for the people, it is a useless alarm, a most unworthy act, to peril a great cause for such a purpose, even in the smallest detail. And useless as was said before. Gen'l. Butler has no political organization, not a paper that is not so thoroughly engaged by the various aspirants that will venture to defend him when it is well known he is unjustly attacked. Why do the papers devoted to the different interests unite in defaming him? Because from the beginning of this war, he, the earliest in it, has shown ability and power to produce great results with less means than any other man engaged in it. The hate of the rebels is measured by the injury he has done them. The dread of him, among the expectants at the forthcoming Conventions, is in proportion to the wide-spread belief that in inexhaustible resource, in capacity for governing, and in executive ability, he is the foremost man of the times. Gen'l. Gillmore denies that he recommended fortifying and that Genl. Butler refused. From whence did the Post receive information of so reliable a character? Shortly after the battle at Fort Darling two officials from Washington went down to review the works, to ascertain if they were strong enough to be held by a part of the command, as Gen'l. Grant, though reported to be fully reinforced, yet wants more men. This, then, is the point that bears directly upon Gen'l Butler. Are those troops a necessity on the Potomac, or are they withdrawn by instigation from elsewhere, to prevent the possibility of a successful move at this most critical time in political manoeuvering? Was it from such a channel that the Post had its reliable information? That we suffered severely at the Wilderness as
well as the rebels, the price of gold and the long pause sufficiently attest. That Gen'l. Butler was able after that battle to keep his hold on the James River, and make successful war with Beauregard and a part of Lee's force combined, should be a theme for praise not a pretext for violent abuse.
Gen'l. Grant is making another mighty effort for victory, and one that will be successful all true-hearted men believe. While this is so, another, who has done his work perfectly as man is able, should not be a target for the arrows from every quiver aimed widely apart in all but this, nor a scapegoat for all mistakes, misadventures, or misfortunes, past, present, and prospective, that this great army may sustain during the campaign. Especially if, as it would seem to look now, he is deprived of further share in the glorious triumph if we are victorious.

My dear Love: You have grown beautifully less until you have expired altogether. Three lines yesterday, today nothing -- what has happened? You would not from mere idleness neglect to send, I believe. There may be news from Grant that has set you all to work. There has been a rumour to-day that he has won a great victory. The man who drives told me there was heavy firing last night and very rapid, he and his companions heard it while sitting out, and thought it came from your lines. No doubt it was Grant's. George Webster says he was told there are not two hundred left of the regiment that went from the Fort under Smith and fought in the last few days. Tomorrow will bring the news. I have written a long letter to Harriet, and separate ones to Paul and Benny. I have had no word from them, but they went home last Tuesday morning. They went directly through, no stopping on the way. Tonight I rode out alone far away up the beach. I have been reading a tale of love and mischief, ending with suicide. I hate to get hold of these things, they worry me so I do not live like other people, I am confident. I began life entirely different from those I knew. I am as far apart from them now as then. Not that I wish to be. I am busy now from morn till ten at night, very busy, so that the time
may go easily. But in every fibre of me is woven a romance that will die when I am dead, and not till then. Blanche, though much like you, inherits that from me. It is not the school-girl fever, that must find an object, make a match, and then is commonplace forever. But a love of beauty, of art, even where it is not cultivated, an instinctive love for it in every form, in books, painting, poetry, and music. And this is not fanciful that I am writing you, though you may laugh at it. There is a deep and keen sensibility in my nature that time does not deaden, I think it only intensifies, -- and so it will be with her. She will see things more charming, rich, and clothed with a dream beauty, some times in her life, and she will be more worried troubled, and shaken with grief at others. So the balance will be about even. But if I were to choose for her I would have her jolly and selfish. You wrote me sometime ago to write about myself. Now I think you will be glad to hear no more. I shall say goodnight, and leave a chance for a word in the morning, if there is anything to say. Goodnight.
Ask Stephen to put that carpet in a box and direct here. If we stay at the fort we shall want it. No news."

The delay has also been rendered necessary by the expected arrival of other negro troops in this Department.

I certainly will send telegraphic communications when I have anything to communicate that will be of the slightest interest. Everything has been quiet on my lines up to today. Last night I sent a force with Gen'l Gillmore & Hinks to make a demonstration on Petersburg on the one side, while Gen. Kautz with his cavalry should attempt to get in on the other. The infantry was under the command of Gen. Gillmore, who has returned having failed to force the fortifications, but having met with no considerable loss. Gen.

I would be very glad to forward the Richmond papers, but only get mine through my pickets. Communication through flag-of-truce is cut off. First, because of a communication by myself to Commissioner Ould, making inquiry whether negro soldiers would be treated as prisoners of war if captured.

to deliver, I having refused to deliver well ones until that question is definitely settled. This was in obedience with my instructions from the Lieut. Gen.

Dear Sir: I have seen the Surrogate, and he is clearly of opinion that he has no power to dispense with the necessity of General Butler's personal appearance here to qualify as an Executor or to give the necessary bonds.
The Surrogate fully appreciates the embarrassment of General Butler's leaving his post at this most critical time, and were it a discretionary power with him would not hesitate to exercise it.
I suppose that ere this you have met and conferred with the General, and I trust that good fortune and to the fullest extent aiding him, he may be permitted to absent himself for a few days in considering the interests of the estate of his deceased brother, and without prejudice to the interests of the Government. I beg of you to present my respectful regards to him. And ever

Maj. R. S. Davis, Asst. Adjt. Genl., Dept. Va. and N. C.
Major: I have the honor to submit the following report of operations under the order of Maj. Genl. Butler, dated June 8th, 1864, 3 P. M. (Copy appended marked ‘A’).
Immediately after dark I moved two regiments, thirteen hundred (1300) men of my command, to the vicinity of Broadway, and repaired to the Pontoon Bridge at about 9 o'clock, where I received the despatch from Major Gen'l. Butler, dated June 8th, 1864, 11 P. M. (Copy appended marked ""B"").
At about quarter before three o'clock A. M. of June 9th, Gen'l. Gillmore arrived at the Pontoon Bridge, and at 3½ o'clock A. M., his troops having all crossed, I returned to Cope's, where one of my regiments was bivouacked, and awaited the arrival of the rest of the column.
At about five o'clock I march from Cope's, closely following the advance of Genl. Kautz, and on arriving at Baylies received an order from Genl. Gillmore, dated June 9th, 5 A. M. (Copy appended marked ""C"").
I asked Genl. Gillmore if it was the intention to hold on to the enemy's works as long as possible at any rate, and he answered me, ""No; unless we take them within an hour it will be useless to attempt it, and you must use your discretion in the attack.""
I immediately moved forward, understanding that Gen'l. Gillmore was to move to the right of Baylies toward the Appomattox, and then we were to make co-operative attacks. A staff officer of Genl. Gillmore accompanied me to see my forces in position, and then report to the General.
At about seven o'clock A. M., the 9th inst., I crossed Baylies' creek on the Jordan Point Road, and drove the enemy's pickets into his works in Jordan's and Friend's fields, deploying my
forces at Ruffin's house and advancing to the crest of the height; where, finding that my line was in advance of the enemy's works upon the right, some six hundred yards distant, and would be exposed to a flank fire, I attempted to get a battery into position to engage the work either upon the right or left, and sent Gen'l. Gillmore word that I was in position -- that my right flank was advanced beyond the enemy's works, and exposed to an enfilading fire, and that I would advance as soon as I could get my battery to bear upon some point of the enemy's lines.
Finding it impossible to bring the battery into action, unless I left it without a support and exposed to a cross fire, I sent it back to Ruffin's house, and advanced some fifty yards further with my infantry.
Hearing no firing on my right, where I expected a co-operative attack, I now notified Gen'l. Gillmore that the enemy was in considerable force in the works in my front, which were too strong to be carried by assault with the troops at my disposal for the purpose, as I was exposed to a fire from the works on my right, and should be obliged to protect my flank by sending back part of my force, -- and received from him a verbal despatch, that he should immediately drive the enemy into his works and hold him there. Whereupon I retained my position, hoping that the enemy's works would be engaged on my right, and an opportunity given me to go in. It was now about 10 o'clock A. M.
Shortly afterward I was notified by Gen'l. Gillmore that the enemy was advancing in a strong line against his left, which upon the explanation of his staff officer I found to be in the rear of my line in the swamp.
At about twelve o'clock I was notified that Gen'l. Gillmore's forces were withdrawing, and thereupon moved my artillery and reserves across Baylies' creek to Bryant's house.
At one o'clock P. M., on an order from Gen'l. Gillmore, I, withdrew my line from front of the enemy's works to Bryant's, and at about two o'clock was ordered to return to Baylies' house, where I joined the column of Gen'l. Gillmore. I am, Major, very respectfully,

General: The movement to transfer this army to the south side of James River will commence after dark to-morrow night. Colonel Comstock, of my staff, was sent specially to ascertain what was necessary to make your position secure in the interval, during which the enemy might use most of his force against you, and also to ascertain what point on the river we should reach to effect a crossing, if it should not be practicable to reach this side of the river at Bermuda Hundred. Colonel Comstock has not yet returned, so that I cannot make instructions as definite as I would wish, but the time between this and Sunday night being so short in which to get word to you, I must do the best I can.
Col. Dent goes to make arrangements for gun-boats and transportation to send up the Chickahominy to take to you the Eighteenth Corps. This corps will leave its position in the trenches as early in the evening to-morrow as possible, and make a forced march to Cole's Landing or Ferry, where it should reach by 10 A. M. the following morning. This corps numbers now 15,300 men. They take with them neither wagons nor artillery, these latter marching with the balance of the army to the James River. The remainder of the army will cross the Chickahominy at Long Bridge and at Jones', and strike the river at the most practicable crossing below City Point. I directed several days ago that all re-enforcements for the army should be sent to you. I am not advised of the number that may have gone, but suppose you have received from 6,000 to 10,000. General Smith will also reach you as soon as the enemy could, going by the way of Richmond. The balance of the force will not be more than one day behind, unless detained by the whole of Lee's army, in which case you will be strong enough.
I wish you to direct the proper staff officers, your chief engineer and chief quartermaster, to commence at once the collection of all the means in their reach for crossing the army on its arrival. If there is a point below City Point where a pontoon bridge can be thrown, have it laid. Expecting the arrival of the Eighteenth Corps by Monday night, if you deem it practicable from the force you now have to seize and hold Petersburg,
you may prepare to start on arrival of troops to hold your present lines. I do not want Petersburg visited, however, unless it is held, nor an attempt to take it unless you feel a reasonable degree of confidence of success. If you should go there, I think troops should take nothing with them except what they carry, depending upon supplies being sent after the place is secured. If Colonel Dent should not succeed in securing the requisite amount of transportation for the Eighteenth Corps before reaching you, please have the balance supplied. I am, general.
Very respectfully, your obedient servant,
U. S. Grant, Lieutenant-General
P. S. On reflection, I will send the Eighteenth Corps by way of White House. The distance which they will have to march will be enough shorter to enable them to reach you about the same time, and the uncertainty of navigation of the Chickahominy will be avoided. U. S. G.

Dear Harriet: I have thought of a dozen articles to send for, and will try to enumerate some of them. The lace that was round my handkerchief, a lace, doubled-quilled ruffle for the neck, bathing dress, black lace hat, parasol with an exquisite
cornelian ball to finish the handle, or an ivory ball. Well, they have gone from my mind again, some of the articles. It is no great matter if I should come home soon. But I can't seem to tell about that, things are so uncertain. I should like those things that are in the house, and the black alpaca. Its being fine is no objection to it.
Fisher and Lauretta will soon be here again. I suppose it is likely that Blanche and I shall return with them. I could not help putting this house in order, new carpeting the entry and stairs, and taking up the others to have them cleaned. I have been to the Hospitals many times, three days in succession at one time. The bad scents from the wounds, and the deplorable sights I cannot bear every day.
Mr. Butler is killed in his moves by Gillmore. He ordered an attack on Petersburg, which is left with very few troops. The cavalry under Kautz went in, Gillmore with the infantry went up to the entrenchments, and without firing a gun thought they looked too strong, and came back again. When he found, Kautz had been in, he said he ought to have let him know, when his orders were to make the attack.
It is owing to him we had no success at Charleston. He was ordered to be at Petersburg by daylight and was there at noon. In every move he is hours behind the time. And this man must have precedence because of his position! It is enough to make one mad. If that attack had been made by another officer we should now have Petersburg. I suppose it will not answer for me to criticise.
The hundred and fifty I supposed you would be likely to spend for your wardrobe, if you have energy enough to plan what you want. Are not the children sorry they went home by this time?
Very affectionately yours, Sarah

A statement of verbal communication held between Maj. Gen. Q. A.
Gillmore and Brig. Genl. E. W. Hinks on June 9th, 1864
When Gen. Hinks left the main column with his command, I was ordered by Gen. Gillmore to attach myself to his Staff, and to return as soon as he established his line; and to report
the shortest line of communication. At about 8 A. M., Gen. Hinks took a position in front of the enemy's works, and moved to the attack; but finding a battery on his right which could enfilade his line, he halted and ordered up his artillery, directing me to return to Gen. Gillmore, and report that he could not advance until the battery on his right was taken.
I returned by way of the road, but reported that possibly communication could be established across the country. (A) About 9.15 A. M. Gen. Gillmore directed me to return to Gen. Hinks and state that Col. Hawley was about to advance, and would drive the enemy within their fortifications, and hold them there, and that he, (Gen. Gillmore) wished Gen. Hinks to do the same, and that if he saw an opportunity to assault with success he would do so. In this last, Gen. Hinks was to use his discretion, and not to consider it an order to assault.
This time I found a road leading almost direct to Gen. Hinks' Hd. Qrs.
(B) Gen. Hinks replied that the enemy was much too strong for him, and that he had withdrawn his right to the edge of the woods, from which position he could hold the enemy within their works. He also directed me to inform Gen. Gillmore (C) that there was a full field battery of brass pieces in each of the batteries on his front; that reinforcements of two regiments had been seen to enter the fortifications (D) from Petersburg, and that (E) ""it would be slaughter to attempt an assault,"" or words to that effect; also that he, Gen. Hinks, had seen the works in front of Col. Hawley, and considered them formidable.
About 11 A. M. I was again sent to Genl. Hinks, to inform him that the enemy was advancing a strong skirmish line, and that disposition had been made to oppose them. In case of retreat, Gen. Hinks would be governed by the report of Col. Hawley's firing. At Gen. Hinks' Hd. Qrs. I met one of his staff, who reported that Genl. H. considered his present position unsafe, as his flanks were exposed, and that he was about to retreat to a stronger position half a mile in the rear; but should still hold his present skirmish line commanding the enemy's works. After an unsuccessful attempt to find Gen. H., I returned to Gen. Gillmore's Hd. Qrs.
At 1 P. M. Gen. Gillmore directed me to request Gen. Hinks to fall back to the Clover Field, but not to enter the City Point road until Col. Hawley had passed down with his command.
This last was delivered at 1.30 P. M., and at 1.40 P. M. Gen. Hinks was retiring.

Dearest: Do you know I am obliged to keep at work or I could not stay here. The carpets have been taken up and the rooms cleaned, a new entry and stair carpet put down. All this done, though I may leave at any time. I thought when you left there was little chance you would return here to stop. Yet you may; we cannot look forward a day. It seems to me impossible that we are to have this weak, imperfect set to govern another four years. I asked Col. Shaffer what he thought now. You told me, I said, that Lincoln had not a chance unless Seward was thrown over. Now, not only will Seward not be put aside, but he will rule more absolutely for the next four years than he has in the years gone by. He is all there ever has been or will be of government while Lincoln is President. The Col.'s brother is a strong Lincoln man. Perhaps it is all right. Among this whole party Seward was the ablest man of them all, why should he not rule? Even yet it may all break down, one would think such an Administration or the country would go to the wall. I do not often praise you, but it is my firm belief that there is but one man now known to the people who can save this country in its present critical state from utter loss and confusion irremediable; and that is yourself. Not that in time of peace and plenty you would be the best or only man; but I have seen, nor heard, of no man but you with broad and comprehensive views, and also a determined will and grasp of power (when within your reach) to carry them into effect. I think the country is doomed if Lincoln is again elected. We shall never conquer. And the most abject compromises will be forced upon us. I send you a letter from Mrs. Parten. What do you think of the style for a lady? Take care that you return it to me. I send you one
from Lotie. If we ever have any more sick animals I hope Dr. Wood will not be allowed to come near them. Every one has died that he has attended. I hear there are several vessels gone up the James with troops. I wonder if you will try Petersburg again, or is it too late? Do you think about me now and then? I suppose not much, for when you are not busy you sleep, or think of something else, and so, Good-night, it is past eleven. Last night a negro crept into a casemate and stole a lady's purse, and frightened her into convulsions. A pretty thing for thievery to be abroad in this guarded spot! Col. Roberts will be in danger of indictment. I should think he would lose his temper at the audacity of the thing, and the danger of disturbing Mrs. Roberts. Once more, Goodnight, I shall go to sleep when I get ready."
"June 11, 1864","Hdqrs. Dept. of Virginia and North Carolina, in the Field, June 11, '64
Maj. Gen. Q. A. Gillmore, Comdg. Tenth Army Corps, etc., Line of Intrenchments
General: I have received your official report sent to me in obedience as to time, but not in compliance with my orders of the 10th of June in regard to the movement upon Petersburg Your note to Colonel Shaffer, chief of staff, has been shown me, acknowledging receipt of that officer's note containing the indorsement upon your report of June 10, and requesting a copy of the orders you have disobeyed. Of course you know the orders you have received, and I will with care and in detail set forth wherein I believe them to have been disobeyed. This is due to you as well as myself.
In relation to your request for a court of inquiry, it shall be granted to you so far as the operations of the 8th, 9th, and 10th of June, of which alone I have any report thereof, are concerned. Such I expected and hoped would be the legitimate result of the indorsement on your report. Your demand of a court of inquiry into all your official acts and conduct while serving in this department is entirely inadmissible, and as it seems to me from the very good reason that no report having been made by you of any of your other operations, I have no official knowledge by which I can either approve or condemn that conduct, and it would seem to be manifestly improper to grant a court of inquiry upon conduct never officially reported for approval or disapproval. It is possible that when your
report of your other operations shall come in there may be no difference of opinion, and therefore nothing to be the subject of inquiry.
I must call your attention to the mistake in your note of this day, which states that I ask for details which could only be obtained from subordinate reports. If you will turn to the order of the 10th, you will find that you were expressly required only to state your own acts and omissions, and the orders you yourself gave to General Hinks. Instead of complying in this particular, you sent me on the 11th the statement of conversations of Lieutenant Barnard, acting aide-de-camp, written by himself, which he claims to have had with General Hinks. I wished for the orders which you gave, not the conversations of a subaltern officer. As I proceed I will mention the points wherein your report neither complied with the order nor represents correctly the facts, times, and occurrences, so far as they are known to myself or can be ascertained from others.
The history of your connection with this most unfortunate and ill-conducted expedition is this: I had intended a movement upon Petersburg to be made, founded upon very careful investigation and correct information of the state of the defenses and of the number of the troops and general condition of the enemy, as well in Petersburg as in front of our lines. I had determined to intrust that expedition to the command of Brigadier-General Hinks and General Kautz, General Hinks to take about 3,500 of his colored troops as infantry, and two sections of a battery and assault the enemy's works on two roads, the City Point road and Jordan's Point road, or rather as near those roads as possible, avoiding the strong redans and moving on the light rifle-pits, which were known to connect them. My information was that the force of the enemy consisted of the Seventh North Carolina, a few pieces of field artillery, about 300 of the Seventh Confederate Cavalry, who were employed in picketing the various roads into Petersburg, extending over a circuit of some 20-odd miles, and the second-class militia of the neighborhood, consisting of exempts from physical disability from the army, boys under seventeen, and men between fifty and fifty-five, of which last number I had information there were 40, the whole militia forces amounting to between 1,000 and 1,200. These were the troops manning 9 miles of intrenchments, of which there was but a single line, about 2 and one half miles from the city proper. I had concluded to detach Duncan's brigade of colored troops from the line of intrenchments
on this side of the Appomattox to General Hinks, thus weakening the line in order to make by a very much larger force the attack doubly sure.
I was informed and believed, and do still believe, and have subsequent information to confirm it, that the enemy's infantry parapets were such as might be ridden over by a mounted cavalryman. The plan of attack was that General Kautz should take 1,200 or 1,400 cavalry, and, making a detour which would take a considerable time, go out under cover of a column of infantry, striking out to the left and coming in upon the south side, would move upon the Jerusalem plank road, which is on the left of the town; that movements on the enemy's works in two columns should be made on the right of their intrenchments by the Jordan's Point road and City Point road, avoiding the redans which cover those roads, and assaulting the infantry lines which connect them and which run through open fields, or not very thick woods, one to be a real and the other a feigned attack, to be converted into a real one, if the first, or Kautz's movement was successful. While this plan of attack was being matured at Spring Hill with General Hinks, by a fortuitous circumstance you joined the party. The intended movement, the causes which led to it, the information upon which it was based, and the plan of attack was there unfolded to you between General Hinks, yourself, General Weitzel, and myself. After the attack had been determined upon, and we had separated, I was informed by General Weitzel that you very much desired to take command of the expedition, alleging as a reason the great importance of the expedition to the Union cause, the necessity of having tried troops to cover the retreat in case of disaster, or who would be more to be depended upon in making an assault upon the enemy's lines, and you offered to take one of the white brigades from your line instead of Duncan's colored brigade, which was to be left on the line in its place, and with it to make the real infantry attack.
Against my better judgment, feeling unwilling to decline an offer to have the expedition led by an officer of your rank and presumed experience, and feeling still more unwilling to trust so important an enterprise to untried troops, as yet very little under fire, and colored troops whom you seemed to think were not to be so much depended upon as your own, I accepted the offer, and placed the whole detail of preparing the expedition, so far as your part was concerned, in your hands. This was about 12 M. on the 8th. I took upon myself to see to it
hat General Hinks should have his brigade of colored troops eady at the time appointed, and this was promptly done by him. You were directed to march the brigade from your lines at 12 o'clock at night across the pontoon bridge, which has been laid now three weeks on the left of the line of intrenchments, of which you have been many days in command, and which forms a part of the defensive works of that line, because it is the means of marching troops to re-enforce the extreme left work on the southern side of the Appomattox, if attacked, or to withdraw troops from that work on to your line, if there attacked. After crossing that pontoon bridge you were to put your brigade in some convenient spot until near daylight, and then, in conjunction with General Hinks, you were to march 3 miles, which would bring you upon the enemy's pickets by a good, tried, and high road, which had been many times reconnoitered by General Hinks' cavalry, and which could not be mistaken. You were then to march rapidly at daybreak, drive in the enemy's pickets, follow them closely, and pursue them into their works. As soon as your column of infantry uncovered a road which led to the left in the direction of the Jerusalem plank road, General Kautz, whose column was to be in the rear of yours, was to go to the left, make the detour of the defenses of the town at such distance from them as to be unobserved, if possible, and made his attack on the left at the Jerusalem plank road. All these positions and roads were explained to you by the aid of the very correct map copied from the one found on the person of the rebel General Walker, who was for a time in command of the defenses of Petersburg.
It was understood between General Kautz and yourself and myself, that the distance he would have to travel would be between 15 and 20 miles. Further, there was explained to you the great benefits which would result from the expedition, in the entire shutting off of supplies for an indefinite time from Lee's army, by the cutting of the bridges across the Appomattox, especially the one known as the Government bridge, which has been built by the rebel authorities, and solely used for their own purposes since the war; and as that railroad bridge formed the only link of railroad of the proper gauge on which the transportation of Lee's army could be sent south, and as immediately upon an attack upon Petersburg from the south side, all the rolling-stock at Petersburg would be sent to Richmond, and there be effectually cut off, it seemed to me that to obtain the object would justify the risk of a pretty large expenditure of life,
if necessary, and therefore I gave you as my deliberate opinion that the advantage would be cheaply purchased at 500, and not too dearly with the sacrifice of 1,000 men in killed and wounded. All these details, the importance of moving in time to make an early attack in the morning, in order that you might be able to return to your intrenchments at daybreak on the following morning, where, if the enemy were in any force we might expect an attack upon our lines in return for the attack upon Petersburg, if at all, were fully explained to you, and upon your suggestion that the march of your troops (which, however, by no accident could exceed 20 miles) would be too fatiguing, I stated to you that if successful in your attack on Petersburg, you might content yourself by sending back 1,000 of the negro troops, with which I would endeavor to hold the intrenchments; and that, knowing their marching capabilities, I had no doubt of their being able to come in.
It was further explained to you that if you got into Petersburg and destroyed the bridges so as to put the Appomattox without means of being crossed between General Kautz and the enemy's forces in front of our line of intrenchments, he was then to proceed down the railroad with his cavalry, destroying it as far as he could, until he was opposed by a sufficient force of the enemy guarding the railroad to cause him to turn back.
At 5.10 in the afternoon of the 8th instant, in answer to your suggestion as to taking two batteries of artillery, I replied to you, I thought ""two sections of a battery would be sufficient, because this is not to be artillery work, but a quick, decisive push."" You informed me that you intended to take four regiments, and that you hardly knew how you could take any single brigade, because many of the men of each brigade were on picket, and to withdraw the pickets and change them before the usual time would give the enemy notice that a movement was contemplated. I therefore authorized you to form a composite brigade of four regiments, from the regiments not on picket, to obviate that difficulty, and stated that I supposed those four regiments would be at least equal in numbers to the two negro regiments with which I had intended to make one of the attacks. In violation of that understanding, knowing how much you weakened our line here, and without my knowledge, you took five regiments, to wit: Seventh Connecticut, Third New Hampshire, Seventh New Hampshire, Sixth Connecticut, and Sixty-second Ohio, and although directed, by my order of the 10th, to ""state all the regiments, companies, and
detachments which you took with you,"" you have, either carelessly or purposely, concealed the fact that you took the fifth regiment, and have made no mention of the cavalry or artillery which you took with you. How such an omission could carelessly have happened under my order to you to ""carefully note each particular of this order and see that each is answered specifically,"" and to ""state also the regiments, companies, and detachments you had with you independent of Generals Kautz's and Hinks' commands,"" will require explanation.
Further, in contravention of your own deliberative opinion given to me, you took the fifth regiment from the line of pickets, not giving it time hardly to get ready before it was required to be in order to march. Instead, then, of marching at a proper hour to reach the other side at 12 o'clock, where you yourself desired me to send a staff officer to order General Hinks to report to you at 12 o'clock, you did not personally reach that point until 2.30 in the morning, keeping General Hinks waiting for you in the saddle from 12 to 2.30, and the excuse in your report that some of your regiments got lost is hardly an answer for your own remissness in not keeping an appointment with a general officer of nearly an equal rank with yourself, and of quite as meritorious services. You also say that some of your ""regiments got lost in getting to the pontoon bridge."" Now, as the pontoon bridge is on the left of your line of intrenchments, it would seem that your regiments got lost within their own lines. But is it not true that you sent no officer of your staff to direct the march of that column as is customary and usual among generals of volunteers? Nay, more. Is it not also true that your chief of staff woke me up at 2 o'clock in the morning to inquire the road, at my headquarters, to the pontoon bridge, which road should have been as familiar to him and to you as the path to your bed? The consequence was that your troops, instead of marching by a good dry road from the intrenchments across to the pontoon bridge, were dragged through the swamps a mile in the rear of your lines, in the mud reaching nearly to their knees, and fatigued with being kept up all night wandering about like sheep without a shepherd, and instead of having the hours from 12 to 3 to rest in, they had, as stated in your despatch to me, at 3.40 A. M., just crossed the river, thus spending from 10.30 P. M. on the 8th, the time at which they actually moved, to 3.40 A. M. on the 9th (five hours and ten minutes) in moving over a space which does not exceed by measurement 4 miles, besides remaining, from 9 P. M., when they were by your
order to be ready an hour and a half under arms before they did move at all.
The question might be here asked: If it took five hours and ten minutes to get out of your lines, how long would it take you to get into the enemy's?
In your report you further say that on the evening of the 8th you were instructed to take command of the expedition. Now, you know that, at your own special request, at 12 M. it was arranged that you should take command of the expedition, and you will further remember that I sent you, at your request, at about 2 o'clock in the afternoon of the 8th, a guide who should be able to explain to you the nature of the enemy's works. You further say in your report that Generals Kautz and Hinks had received all their instructions preparatorily from myself. That is true; but those instructions to General Hinks and Kautz were given in your presence and upon consultation with you. You further say in your report that some of the regiments lost the road to the pontoon bridge so that General Kautz and Colonel Hawley (in command of your brigade) did not get their commands across until 3.40 A. M. That report throws unmerited censure upon General Kautz, because his command was ordered to ""follow the infantry across the bridge,"" and, of course, if he obeyed his orders, until you got across he could not go over.
You stated to me in your despatch of 3.40 A. M. that you had ""no doubt the enemy are fully apprised of our movement by the noise of the bridge. It is not muffled, and the crossing of the cavalry can be heard for miles."" The bridge was muffled by the engineer corps, some 10 bales of hay having been put upon it to prevent the sound of the cavalry being heard upon it, and if it was gone, it was because your troops used it up in attempting to dry the mud and water (which they should not have had upon them if properly directed) from their feet as they passed it. The fact that it was not heard many miles is now ascertained, because you surprised and captured in the morning the enemy's pickets, hours after the cavalry crossed, within 3 miles in a straight line of this very bridge, and they say, upon examination, that they did not hear then of the movement. You did not move until 5.30 A. M., an hour after sunrise. You did not reach the enemy's outer pickets until after 8 o'clock, and you made no such demonstration as caused any alarm in Petersburg until 9 o'clock, as is evidenced by the fact that General Kautz's command captured a schoolmaster,
whom I have examined, who was in his school in Petersburg after 9 o'clock, when the first alarm was given.
You further say in your report that -- It was understood as essential that the attack should be a quick, decisive push to prevent re-enforcements to the enemy from their forces on our front north of the Appomattox, only about two hours' march distant.
They had 7 miles to march to Petersburg, and S to the intrenchments, while you had but 4 to march. If they used the same rate of progress that you did it would be a matter of easy calculation at what time the enemy's re-enforcements would arrive. But you forget to state that it was agreed upon on my part that my artillery should open all along my line in an active demonstration upon their forces, to keep them before us while you made your movement, and that that opening by me was to be upon the first gun being heard from you, and I waited at the signal station with my glass on where your column should have been until nearly 9 o'clock, and then opened immediately, as was agreed upon, on hearing your first gun, and with such effect that no forces left the front and passed to Petersburg until after you returned within your own intrenchments. This was made certain by the observations of the signal officers who commanded both the turnpike and the railroad, being the only communication between the enemy in our front and Petersburg. You have endeavored to state in your report what my orders to Generals Kautz and Hinks were. That was no part of your report required by my order. I knew what my orders to them were without any information from that source.
You further say, in your report, ""Hawley drove in the enemy's pickets on the City Point road shortly after 6 A. M., and about 7 was before the enemy's works."" There must certainly be a very grave mistake here. You say in your despatch to me that you moved at 5.30 A. M. You were then 4 miles from the enemy's works, and unless they advanced their pickets much farther than usual, and your rate of progress was much faster than when in your own lines, you could not have reached his pickets at 6 o'clock, nor could you have been before his works at 7, nor were you there at that time, because when before his works, when within cannon range, he opened fire upon you, and that first gun was much nearer 9 than 7. And Colonel Hawley will tell you, if you will ask him, as he has told me, that he never did drive in the enemy's pickets at any time during the day, much less at 6 o'clock in the morning.
You say further, in your report, that General Kautz was expected to reach the enemy's works at 9 o'clock. As it was understood that his march was at least 15 miles to your 4, and as he expressly said that he should only march upon a walk, how could you suppose that he could accomplish the 15 miles in nearly the same time that it took you to accomplish the 4? You nowhere in your report say, nor is it true, that you or your brigade commander of the force under your immediate command, with which you were to make the real attack, saw any 20 rebel soldiers in any one body during this day. You saw no line of battle, nor did your soldiers approach near enough their enemy's works to ascertain whether or not there was an abattis in front of them, and the strength of them was only demonstrated upon another part of the line, where they were ridden over by General Kautz with his cavalry.
You further report to me that General Hinks ""drove the enemy into their intrenchments,"" and that you ordered him to hold his position and keep the enemy within his intrenchments, and that he replied that he thought he could do it. His exact reply was that he ""could do so until doomsday,"" if that was all you desired. You further say, in your report, that ""on Colonel Hawley's front the enemy were never entirely within their works, but fought outside."" As you never saw anything but a skirmish line fighting, why do you say that ""Colonel Hawley drove in the pickets,"" if they always fought outside? You further say, ""As soon as the nature of the works in our front was ascertained, I was convinced that an assault upon them would, in all probability, fail."" It is respectfully submitted that that was none of your business. You were ordered to make that assault, and upon the commanding general was the responsibility. You further say in your report that ""I ordered the two positions to be maintained, expecting every moment to hear from General Kautz, who was expected to reach the enemy's works at 9 o'clock."" Is there anything in your report or in the facts which is descriptive of a ""quick, decisive push,"" or anything which seems like that, or any reported attempt to obey my order? You further say that ""at about 1 o'clock, in order to get General Hinks and Colonel Hawley together, I directed them to withdraw to the junction of the road in front of Baylor's, where I waited until after 3 o'clock to hear from General Kautz,"" or, in other words, General Hinks and Colonel Hawley ""being a mile apart in front of the enemy's works,"" as you say in a former part of your report, you withdrew them
2 miles from those works in order to get them together. It might be supposed that a junction of a mile might have been made without a withdrawal of 2 miles from in front of the intrenchments, which you admit that, if you could not take, you were to remain and hold the enemy in them until you heard from General Kautz. It is suggested that advancing toward him 2 miles would have been a much more certain way to have heard from him.
Again you say, ""Receiving no information from that quarter, I concluded that he had taken his command on a raid, as directed or authorized by you."" This last sentence is an entire misstatement of the fact, so gross that one would suppose it must have been known to you. General Kautz was not authorized or directed by me to go on any raid until after Petersburg was taken, the bridges and public buildings and public property destroyed, which would put the lines of the Appomattox between him and the enemy. Nothing could be better understood; nothing more distinct. If you supposed he had taken Petersburg and then gone on the raid authorized. why did you not go in? If you supposed he had not taken Petersburg, why did you not go to his support? It seems to me that an infantry support of 3,500 men deserting 1,400 cavalry and leaving them to their fate in immediate contact with the forces of the enemy, too large for that infantry to attack, according to the theory upon which you were acting, was the most unsoldierly act ever done by a commanding officer.
You further say, in your report, that you ""then withdrew to the saw-mill, where I remained about an hour, and then marched back to our intrenchments;"" or, in other words, you withdrew another half mile from the enemy, and waited another hour. Now it turns out that at 1.30, thirty minutes after you withdrew your forces from the enemy, General Kautz made his attack at the point designated, carried the works, penetrated the town of Petersburg, and did very gallantly all that he was required to do, but was obliged to withdraw, receiving no support from you, who was at that time industriously getting General Hinks and Colonel Hawley together by withdrawing from before the enemy's militia.
You say further in your report that ""it was no part of the plan to assault the enemy's works on the right as they were known to have interior lines of redoubts."" At a single point only is there an interior line, and that is at Jordan's, on the City Point road, and it was fully explained to you that the
interior line was a failure, being commanded by the outer line, which was higher, and you yourself agreed with me that you would make the real attack on the right while General Hinks made the feigned attack; and in my order of this morning for you to report, you were ordered to say which was to make the feigned and which the real attack, which you have wholly omitted to do. You were also ordered to ""give all verbal orders which you sent to General Hinks,"" which you have failed to do. You were also ordered to ""state the regiments, companies, and detachments which you took with you,"" which you have failed to do. You were also ordered to ""state specially the times at which you were ordered to act and move,"" which you have failed to do. You were also directed to ""state the nearness which your column reached the enemy's works,"" which you have failed to do. You were also directed to ""state how far in advance or rear you were of General Hinks' column,"" which you have failed to do. You were also ordered to ""give the plan agreed upon between you, if any,"" which you have failed to do; and to ""give the number of men lost in killed and wounded in an attack made, with a description of the attack,"" which you have failed to do; and you were told that ""you need not give any report of the operations of Generals Kautz or Hinks,"" which you have attempted to do.
For these reasons your report is wholly defective, unsatisfactory, and unapproved of, and your entire action such as requires me to report it to the general commanding the Army of the United States and to the War Department for such action as they may think proper.
Certain it is, made so from the examination of prisoners captured since, as well as before, that 4,500 of my best troops under your command were kept at bay without an attempt at attack, so far as you were concerned, by some 1,500 men, 600 only of which were Confederate troops, and the rest old men and boys, the grave and the cradle being robbed of about equal proportions to compose the force opposed to you. Without, at this moment, giving words of characterization of the disobedience of orders and your conduct on the field, I submit this statement of facts in review of your report, as you have requested me to do, most of them known to myself, my chief engineer, my signal officers, and an officer of General Grant's staff, who was here present, hearing the instructions and knowing what was done from your verbal report made in his presence upon your return, to your careful consideration; and in connection.
I will call your attention to the fact that after your return to my headquarters at 6 o'clock in the evening, and upon being informed of what had happened to General Kautz, you were very anxious to go out to find him with an escort of 50 cavalry, and that you sent your body guard to my headquarters at 8.30 in the evening for that purpose, when I informed you that General Kautz had returned, having been inside the intrenchments of Petersburg. It would seem that if when you were within 5 miles of him with 3,500 men you were not able to open communication with him, it was hardly worth while to try with a body guard of 50, because such an operation would have added weakness to him and not strength.
To have been obliged to review your report, point out some of its errors and inconsistencies, and to bring out the disobedience of orders, as well in point of time as in want of action, to be obliged to dwell upon the details of this humiliating failure, to probe anew the acute wounds of hopes blasted when so much was expected, to be obliged to comment even with deserved severity upon the actions of an officer whose personal relations have been as pleasant as mine with you, has been a most painful task, to which nothing but a conviction of the stern necessity of a duty to the country to be done could have compelled me. I have the honor to be,

Dearest: Well, the die is cast once more, and the stake lost. Well, I suppose it was appointed to be, that Genl. Gillmore is a
valuable officer for the rebels. If he could manage in the next moves to inflict on the enemy a little of the mischief he has done our cause it might be a reason why he should not be courtmartialed. Well, there is no help for it, so once more ""have patience, good people."" You must be dull tonight, but never heed, it is the pastime of war. I am so wearied of the talk of the incapacity of volunteers. Why, if the regular army were looked to carefully, there are very few to be found beyond mediocrity, and the best of them often make the grossest mistakes. But let it pass, we must take things as they are. I only wish you could be rid of this incubus. Of one thing you may be sure, this campaign is but just begun. Shaffer called this morning and told me of the convention, what he would have done but for being sick, what he did do, and so forth. I have my own opinion about some things. The name is very well represented as well as Kinsman's. Be a little careful about my letters, and return them in yours. I write somewhat recklessly, certainly not for third parties. Would you not be glad to be at home tonight? I should like very much to see you. It will be well, very well, when all this is over. Camp life is not the best that can be had.

You will be delighted, of course, when it is bustle, bustle, and ""the busy hum of preparation"" again salutes your ears. I should be, were I you. Camp life without action is a sorry thing. No better than the negroes' life at Hampton. What is there to give us joy and daily delight? We must not look for it. But self-control, and a degree of comfort will come, with work, work, work. Sometimes children's voices and the breath of love may bring a thrill of joy, but we cannot

It will take some time to restore to your bronzed features the ""pale cast of thought."" Altered somewhat, from the keen, incisive, Neroish looking person, in black dress-coat and white choker, described two years ago at Washington. I was in doubt for a while, but again my mind returns to it with renewed conviction, those troops were removed from you for political reasons. I doubt if Grant hardly knew of it. That speech of Raymond's (the Times is Seward's paper) sent by Mrs. Parton shows their fear of you. I think they will give you soldiers now. But yet they are afraid of you, and will not dare to let you have much chance. Fate was against you, too, to throw in your path a stumbling block like Gillmore. Or perhaps they knew well enough, and left him on purpose that nothing should be done, and Fate has no part in it.

Dear Fisher: I am more convinced than ever that the removal of those troops was a political action wholly.
Weitzel remarked to Webster that Comstock, chief aid to Grant, said that Halleck had done splendidly in sending forward reinforcements. Grant had not been much pleased with him before in some things, but in this he was satisfied Halleck had gathered troops from every corner. So you see that matter
was left entirely with Halleck. And those men came down from Washington solely for the reasons we supposed. I had a note from Mrs. Parton on the day you left. In it she wrote that some one remarked to Raymond, that he hoped Butler would take Richmond. ""Butler, Butler!"" he ejaculated, ""God forbid, he is already too popular."" Our first idea was right.

You will have to think very fast now. I cannot believe you will be allowed a great chance unless it comes by accident. Remember well that though you fight for the salvation of the country, now in extreme peril, you have to fight both sides to be allowed to help save it. I would rather fight the rebels, an open foe, than encounter the home enemy, who strike, assassin-like, under cover, and at the moment success awaits you. But you have many times wrung triumph from the very clutch of despair, and will do it again, and again, in despite of them all. Never yield an inch, or droop an hour, disheartened.

Dear Fisher: What I thought is surely true. Genl. Smith came to see me this morning. He is on his way to Mr. Butler with his corps. He is thoroughly disgusted with what they have made him do, and the conduct of the war generally in the details, which he puts upon Meade. He is inclined to shield Grant somewhat, but he evidently looks upon it from the beginning as a desperate butchery for us with comparatively little loss for the rebels. He says on the line of the Potomac alone we have lost seventy thousand men, and that this campaign will end it, -- if we are not successful now, we can never raise another army. Then, I said, we must be successful, for we must not, cannot yield. He hopes that Wilson will institute an inquiry of those battles where he was engaged on the Potomac. He says it was absolute butchery, his Massachusetts men were piled in heaps without any result, and he is rejoiced to go back to Mr. Butler. I asked him if the order for his removal came from Grant or Washington. He did not reply to the point, but said Grant might have thought it well to have a force when he swung round his left. But, I said, ""were you or could you be of half the use to him there that you could have been with Mr. Butler to take Petersburg, or harass the rebels south of Richmond?"" ""No, no,"" he replied, ""if we now had Petersburg, the rebels would be cornered. I ought to have stayed with Genl. Butler."" He says he was of no use on the Potomac. They had men enough already for slaughter. Now, what say you? Every word I wrote was true. I would like Mr. Parton to know these things, if nothing else comes of them. I could not report what Gen. Smith says, of course, but he is in that mind he will say it anywhere. I write this for your satisfaction and Mr. Parton's.
Yours, Sarah
I believe that Gen'l. Butler and Gen'l. Smith will act with one will. On the Potomac he says Meade complains no two of his Corps Commanders act by consultation or concert. I would rather be a toad, and feed upon the vapors of a dungeon,
than in Meade's place now. If success attends, the glory is Grant's; if defeat follows, the peevishness, jealousy, and incompetency of Meade is commented upon. But I hope there is a better chance for Mr. Butler even by Gen'l. Smith's dissatisfaction with what he has gone through. If Gillmore can be changed, and one spirit infused through the command, they will deal mighty blows yet."

Lieut. Gen. U. S. Grant, Commanding Armies of United States
General: I have the honor to inclose the report of General Gillmore of his operations on Petersburg, with my indorsement thereon; also a copy of a note to my chief of staff received in reply, also the reply furnished him (Gillmore) by me at his request, and a copy of my special order of this date being the action taken upon the whole subject. I need not say to you how unpleasant and painful this whole matter has been, and the necessity of taking the action I have, which seemed to me imperative. The whole matter will be investigated by a competent court of inquiry.
Not taking into account the loss of valuable lives in other engagements in the war, a more disastrous defeat has not been
sustained by the American arms than this has been to the success of the operations on the south side of the James. Had the movement been a success, as it easily might have been, Petersburg would have been in our possession, as all subsequent and prior information shows it might and ought to have been, the whole railroad destroyed effectually, the line of the Appomattox secured, and the enemy's defensive works in our front rendered useless. I also inclose a copy of the Richmond Sentinel with the account of the Petersburg Express of the affair. It will be seen by that account that the enemy never discovered that Generals Gillmore and Hinks, with the real attacking column, came against them at all. They describe the movements of the real column of attack simply ""as feints to deceive our forces,"" while the real movement for the surprise and capture of the city was on the Jerusalem plank road coming to Petersburg from a southerly direction. On the two first roads (i. e., the City Point road and the Prince George Court-House road, upon which was General Gillmore's column) the enemy appeared in considerable numbers as early as 7 o'clock, and this skirmishing was kept up for some time.
I also inclose a copy of the map furnished General Gillmore, with a sketch of the line of fortifications, and an indication of his and General Hinks' position and General Kautz's attack.
I inclose official copies of General Hinks' and General Kautz's reports of the same movement without indorsement, as they have been sufficiently commented upon in my reply to General Gillmore, furnished at his request. I have the honor to be,

"June 14, 1864","Hdqrs. Dept. of Virginia and North Carolina, near Point of Rocks, Va., June 14, 1864
Major-General Gillmore, U. S. Army
General: I have the honor to acknowledge the receipt of your note of the 14th of June, dated Headquarters Tenth Army Corps, in the field near Hatcher's, June 14, 1864. I take leave to call your attention to the heading. After having been relieved from the command of the Tenth Army Corps, or of any troops in the field, such heading must have been an inadvertence. General Gillmore is laboring under a much more grave misapprehension than he imports to the commanding general
if he supposes that it became the painful duty of the commanding general to relieve him from his command because of his request for the court of inquiry. The special order so relieving him was made because of the opinions expressed and the allegations made in the review by the major-general commanding of General Gillmore's action near Petersburg. If those are in any degree correct, and General Gillmore will understand that by the major-general commanding they must be assumed to be so, then General Gillmore's services in the field would not be valuable to the service or the country; but, on the contrary, great mischief might arise, because of his rank, from the necessity of putting him in command of troops which, if the facts in that report are substantially correct, could not be safely intrusted to General Gillmore's charge with hopes of success. In kind consideration, therefore, to General Gillmore, the major-general commanding coupled the order relieving him from command, which from the 9th day of June has been, in the judgment of the major-general commanding, a necessity, with another paragraph in the order which gratified his request for a court of inquiry; and leave is taken to assure General Gillmore that he would have been relieved from command without any such request, and the time was only delayed until the hourly expected arrival of an officer of experience and ability to take his place. It is a source of regret that General Gillmore should have misconstrued what was intended as a kindness. General Gillmore will, therefore, at once proceed to Fortress Monroe, and there await further orders. The major-general commanding has the honor to state his understanding of General Gillmore's request for a court of inquiry, and the regulations and the purport of the article of war as governing the action which ought to be taken upon such request. First, then, the Ninety-second Article of War provides, among other things, that:
""As courts of inquiry may be perverted to dishonorable purposes, and may be considered as engines of destruction to military merit in the hands of weak and envious commanders, they are hereby prohibited unless directed by the President of the United States, or demanded by the accused.""
Now, then, to prevent subordinates from being oppressed by their superiors, the superior is not allowed to order a court against a subordinate's wishes, but must ask the President leave so to do; but it by no means follows that therefore the subordinate has a right to have a court directed by the President at his request, or that the President, if he directs the court, will
not direct it to be ordered by the superior. Therefore, understanding from your note that you desired a court of inquiry, that request was promptly granted you. The phrase in your note of the 12th is:
""It only remains for me to deny respectfully, but emphatically, the charges therein set against me, to request a copy of the orders I have destroyed or failed to obey, and then to demand of the President a court of inquiry to investigate all my official acts while serving in this department. I court a full investigation into the part I have taken in the campaign here.""
It is submitted that no man reading that sentence, especially with the context, would fail to find a request for a court as soon as you are furnished a copy of the orders. To that the commanding general replied, ""You knew what your orders were,"" and I pointed out to you wherein it was thought they were not obeyed. This was done with sufficient minuteness at least to give you notice of the particulars in which your conduct was deemed censurable. Then, again, a request to have all your conduct inquired into includes, of course, a request to have a part thereof inquired into; and it may be very proper to grant a part of that request, while one is obliged to refuse another part of it. It, therefore, cannot be said that a request to have all inquired into is not a request to have any given part inquired into.
Whether you behaved well or ill on the 16th of May near Chesterfield, for instance, can in no way illustrate or determine the fact whether you behaved well or ill near Petersburg on the 9th of June following, in another distinct and diverse operation. The commanding general already explained to you that not having received any official report of your action, he could (not), nor ought the President, nor, in his belief, would the President, order any court of inquiry upon all the official conduct of General Gillmore not yet officially reported, except to inquire, possibly, why General Gillmore had not made his official report earlier.
If you request a court of inquiry it will be granted. If you do not request a court of inquiry you will say so, and the commanding general will give it his most attentive consideration whether or not you should be holden to your former request; and, therefore, a categorical answer is desired to this question: Do you, or do you not, wish a court of inquiry upon your report of the operations of the 8th, 9th, and 10th of June, and the commanding general's indorsement?
If you do not, such action will be taken as the commanding general may be advised the good of the public service demands. If you do, as is already stated, it will be granted you; but you are earnestly desired to disabuse yourself of the idea that the question whether you shall or shall not have a court of inquiry into your conduct has anything to do with your being relieved from command. I have the honor to be,

Smith must have at least 15,000 men with him besides cavalry and 4 batteries of artillery.

In your despatch you informed me that Hancock had been ordered to Harrison's Creek. If you will look upon the map compiled in the Bureau of the Topographical Engineers, Washington, 1861, with additions and corrections by Capt. H. L. Abbot, you will see that Harrison's Creek runs into the Appomattox across the City Point railroad, about four miles from Petersburg. This is the only Harrison's Creek I know. My messenger, returning from General Smith, says that General Hancock's corps is at Bailey's Creek, about five or six miles in the rear of the position on Harrison's Creek. I have ordered the wagon train with the rations out there under an escort of two squadrons of cavalry, and with your leave I will order Hancock's corps to advance to Smith, whom I have just heard has not been able yet to carry the interior line of the enemy's works. I would desire Hancock to move up in view of the possible re-enforcement of the enemy during the night. The boat that brings this to City Point will wait answer.

Smith has taken 17 guns, 9 by white and 8 by colored troops, who assaulted and carried their advanced works. Smith says they behaved admirably, and he is not a partial witness. This is the concurrent testimony of all. As the enemy have evacuated our front, I would respectfully suggest whether the steamers at Wilcox Wharf might not take the troops of one of the Corps to Bermuda. There in conjunction with the troops of this line we could I think advance on the railroad and isolate Petersburg, and as only a part of Lee's army has passed down, cut it in two and hold it cut. Our line would be a short one, and we could protect our flanks. At least we should hold an opening from which to envelope Richmond on the south side, and save marching.

The exact state of affairs in my front of this: At daybreak this morning the enemy's line was evacuated by the troops defending it to go to Petersburg, from orders from Beauregard,
but to leave a picket line which should amuse us till Early's division should take their place. By a blunder, the pickets were withdrawn on a part of the line. This was endeavored to be corrected about 8 o'clock, but our pickets discovered the fact early in the morning, and I ordered an advance along the whole line; this flanked the remaining pickets and all were driven in or captured. The railroad being thus open, we moved upon it at once, and after throwing out a brigade toward our right to observe the enemy in the direction of Richmond, we commenced upon the railroad, and have torn up the track for nearly three miles, piling up the ties burning them with the rails laid over them and in some places digging down the embankments. About two o'clock the enemy appeared in force on our right and drove in our pickets, forcing us back to their line of intrenchments and near the James, back to Ware Bottom Church. If we hold what we have now, we can turn their line at any time after Wright's Corps, which I have not yet heard of, comes up.
I shall have three regiments on picket after I withdraw five regiments, the whole eight being left out on that line to be sure and hold it, but as it leaves too large a force, being nearly one-half of my best men, to fight on a picket line, and endangers the safety of my principal line, I withdraw the five regiments, especially as they have been working and fighting all day. My right is within two miles of the turnpike over which Lee must march as the railroad is gone, and within one mile of the gunboats. We are dropping shells upon it in intervals of once in three minutes, which is the firing you hear.

By your note I see I might have gone, but it is too late to regret it. We look for news tonight, and hope for the capture of Petersburg. I do not allow myself to feel sure.

If the rebels have time to get down there, I fear we have not taken it yet. I will believe we have it till I hear to the contrary. Friday morning. No news yet. I cannot believe in this case that no news is good news. I think there is so much to do. The campaign is but just begun, and now the hot weather is really here. I hope we shall have some word in the course of an hour or two. I cannot very well write about anything else, I am so eager to know of this.

The Ninth Corps this morning carried two more redoubts, forming part of the defenses of Petersburg, capturing 450 prisoners and 4 guns. Our successes are being followed up. Our forces drew out from within fifty yards of the enemy's intrenchments at Cold Harbor, made a flank movement of an average of about fifty miles' march, crossing the Chickahominy and James Rivers, the latter 2,000 feet wide and 84 feet deep at point of crossing, and surprised the enemy's rear at Petersburg. This was done without the loss of a wagon or piece of artillery and with the loss of only about 150 stragglers, picked up by the enemy. In covering this move Warren's corps and Wilson's cavalry had frequent skirmishes with the enemy, each losing from fifty to sixty killed and wounded, but inflicting an equal, if not greater, loss upon the enemy. The Eighteenth Corps (Smith's) was transported from White House to Bermuda Hundred by water, moved out near to Petersburg the night of its arrival, and surprised or rather captured the very strong works northeast of Petersburg before sufficient force could be got in there by the enemy to hold them. He was joined the night following this capture by the Second Corps, which in turn captured more of the
enemy's redoubts farther south, and this corps was followed by the Ninth, with the result above stated. All the troops are now up except two divisions covering the wagon trains, and they will be up to-night. The enemy, in their endeavor to re-enforce Petersburg, abandoned their intrenchments in front of Bermuda Hundred. They no doubt expected troops from the north of the James River to take their place before we discovered it. General Butler took advantage of this and moved a force at once upon the railroad and plank road between Richmond and Petersburg, which I hope to retain possession of. Too much credit cannot be given the troops and their commanders for the energy and fortitude displayed during the last five days. Day and night have been all the same, no delays being allowed on any account.

After conferring with General Terry and Colonel Abbot, and after examining the best surveys of the locality, I am of opinion that while we may carry the line in front of Battery No. 4, now occupied by the enemy, it is doubtful whether we can hold it. The advanced positions of the enemy take this line in flank, and those positions we can hardly hope to get to-night. A successful assault will therefore probably be finally repulsed. Whether or not this risk should be undertaken depends much on whether the movement is offensive or defensive. If the latter, my judgment is against it; if the former, and it can be instantly followed up by an adequate force, I should advise that the risk be undertaken. My
troops are still held in readiness to move. My own opinion is that this advanced position should be taken and held only when we are prepared to take and hold the whole line on the right and left to the two rivers. Please instruct me as to what you decide in this matter.

Tomorrow I shall look to hear it is ours. Do men who command think deeply enough on this matter of fighting? War is an art, and it seems to me requires the closest scrutiny, the great point being to get your enemy at a disadvantage. Now, it seems to me they have us that way all the time. Why did not Gen'l. Grant, looking over the whole campaign, see
that Petersburg was essential to his success? And while he held Lee at Chickahominy, detach a force sufficient to take it before he moved himself? If Lee is as quick and capable as heretofore, he can hurry a force to Petersburg that will trouble you to take it. We seem to lack strategic skill, the electric fire of genius, that launches the thunderbolt of war where the enemy look not for it. The only movement worthy of absolute praise during the campaign is yours, at the beginning up the James river. After your troops were removed, had they been stealthily returned to you with half of Grant's army, why could you not have entered Richmond? I suppose I am writing nonsense. But it does seem as though Grant should have kept Lee until advantages were gained where you are, before the two great armies entrenched opposite each other again. Now it would be better to cut their communication and starve them out. To look out on this glorious moonlight and the dark waving branches and listen to the continued breaking of the waves on the sands, it is so rich, and full of peaceful beauty, that I do not like to think what horrors you may be engaged in tonight.

Dearest: I have your note. I am not disappointed that we have not Petersburg. I felt sure if Lee had time to move down that we could not take it without hard fighting. Perhaps not at all. Bennett has been in this last half hour. I sent for him to hear details. But he cannot tell me where Grant's or Lee's army lie at present. You are to have Smith's Corps, Gillmore's, and a part of the sixth reports to you as he understands it, and Smith's Corps are to be recalled from Petersburg. I do not see why, maybe he is mistaken. It seems there is some unpleasant feeling shown to those who do not belong to the Army of the Potomac. I should not wish to encourage it farther than to show sympathy with Smith.
Avoid hostility as much as possible; keep it for the rebels. Dissensions weaken us, and aid the enemy. And all the strength and ability of every officer combined and exerted to the utmost, will no more than suffice to take Richmond. Call on Grant whenever courtesy or good feeling make it proper. I have a fancy you may like each other well if nothing
untoward occurs. You will not I know be very ready to give or take offence with anyone, -- that reminds me of Bennett's funny account of Stephen's tale of woe. He declares he did not need the shaking, for ""you know how I love the General, and do everything for him that I can."" Poor Steve! Tell him every day to sweep the tent where you eat, and put a clean newspaper on the table, and keep the oysters cool, and be as lively as possible.

Dear Sir: Your note came this morning. You are quite right. The time has passed for any vindication at present. Perhaps none will ever be needed. For that campaign may be a glorious success, and the leaders be crowned with laurel, or such an unhappy failure that none will wish to hear of it again. If the defence had immediately followed the attack it might have answered a purpose. Such things are usually as well left alone. I have not received the copy of ""Franklin's Life,"" and fear it is delayed on the way. I will send directly to the various officers and endeavor to find it. In the meantime accept my thanks for your kindness in sending it. I hope it is not lost, for I know I shall find it delightful reading.
I had the pleasure of a very agreeable note from Mrs. Parton the other day. As it was generally kind, or rather I might say, kind for the General, and did not require an immediate answer, I have, as usual, delayed to send one. I forwarded the note directly to Mr. Butler, and am quite sure he found time even in the midst of a movement to read the flattering remarks it contained. I have now written so much, will Mrs. Parton permit me to acknowledge her note through yours, and say I am very sorry your engagements prevented a visit to Fortress Monroe. I am very much obliged and should be happy to accept yours and Mrs. Parton's kind invitation to visit your pleasant home. When there will be a time one can hardly foretell. I am uncertain if I shall be here a week longer, every
week that passes. Blanche will leave school the last of this month, and whether to bring her here or to take her home I am still undecided.
I have expected for the last four days to hear that we had taken Petersburg. Gen'l. Smith has taken the outside works and two hundred and fifty prisoners. That was news sent to me yesterday. This morning there is a rumour that Lee's army is between us and Petersburg. I am waiting anxiously for a letter. I fear we have lost.

To so meritorious and able officer as yourself, and to one toward whom the sincerest personal friendship and the highest respect concur in my mind, I am and shall ever be unwilling to utter a word of complaint. Yet I think duty requires that I should call your attention to the fact that your column, which was ordered to move at daylight in the cool of the morning, is now just passing my head Qrs. in the heat of the day for a ten mile march. The great fault of all our movements is dilatoriness, and if this is the fault of your division commanders, let them be very severely reproved therefor. I have found it necessary to relieve one general for this among other causes, where it took place in a movement of vital importance, and in justice to him you will hardly expect me to pass in silence a like fault where of less moment. The delay of Grouchy, for three hours, lost to Napoleon Waterloo and an empire, and we all remember the bitterness with which the Emperor exclaimed as he waited for his tardy general, ""Il s'amuse à Gembloux.""

When a friend writes you a note, is it not best to read it twice before you answer it unkindly? If you will look again you will find that it contains neither an accusation or a threat, the last it could certainly not contain, as I would not allow anybody but yourself to say you could be ""frightened,"" and you will observe some words interlined lest it might possibly be thought to bear that meaning. No accusation is made, but the fact stated and a suggestion that if the fault was where I supposed it might be, as I saw only a part of the column, it should be corrected. I even stated that I did not desire to complain, and then stated the reason why your attention should be called to it.

Lieut. Genl. Grant, Comd'g. Armies United States
General: I am informed by Brig. Genl. Weitzel that there are now at Baton Rouge some 30 regiments of negro infantry, probably averaging 500, that they have been there for a year simply garrisoning that place. I know Baton Rouge very well; with its fortifications, 3000 determined men can hold it against 15. Certain it is that 1500 men under the lamented William held it against 8000 men under Breckenridge. I am informed from various sources, and believe that for some cause, and I think so far as my experience has gone, want of attention to hygenic principles, the negro soldiers there are dying at a very great rate of mortality. The negro soldiers in this department are by far the healthiest troops I have. With the exception of casualties in battle, the sick are not one & a half per cent. Not in the limits of this note but more at length I am convinced I could explain the causes of this mortality in Louisiana, which has been made the subject of parade in rebel newspapers, and of alarm to the friends of the black man. In view of this, the need of troops, and specially those as well adapted for siege operations as are the negroes, I suggest that as many as could be spared from the Department of the Gulf, and that would be just as many as are ordered away, be sent for to come into this department. I think that 10 or 15000 of effective men could be got in this manner, and the change of the sea air upon their health in the saving of the men would actually pay for the transportation.
Pardon these suggestions if out of place, but my familiarity with the Department of the Gulf has given me means of knowledge upon this subject which I supposed might not be readily within the reach of the Lieut. Genl. Comd'g, and therefore have taken leave to make these suggestions. If it should be thought best to adopt them, I have a staff officer who commanded a regiment at Port Hudson and served two years in the Department of the Gulf, whom I could recommend as a very
competent and efficient person to take charge of the transportation of these negro troops to Fortress Monroe.

"June 21, 1864","Fortress Monroe, June 21, 1864
Dearest: I have heard tonight that Gen'l. Grant would take up his quarters at Bermuda Hundred. I suppose it is only a rumour. I am so disappointed because there is no letter from you tonight. I am confident there is one, but I shall not get it before tomorrow morning. Fisher and Lauretta have gone up to Washington tonight. He will return here. I have ever so much to say about business, and I shall never express just what I wish. I know Carney has written you a note about some things I wish to write about. Gen'l. Shepley is doing a number of things, which either you do, or do not, know anything of. No man that I brought into the Department, were I you, should be allowed to do things that I did not fully understand. Whatever is obnoxious, or open to severe criticism, in a Department, is visited on the Commanding General. Many who are allowed advantages are unscrupulous in their use, because they have all the gain, and the ignominy of their misdeeds falls on the person who has given them the
opportunity to commit them. Gen'l. Shepley, I think, while all about him suffered not a little at N. O., escaped calumny. His position and advantages were better than almost any other man's. That is well, and his good name is a recommendation for further service. But no man should take a large share of my confidence and power a second time, and it freely given, unless I had his in return in every possible form that I desired it. Fisher talked with him today, and did not find him open or communicative. Shaffer is not in his confidence either, and is displeased. If you are not, and let me here remark what I think you also believe, that there is but one man in whom you can have absolute confidence, that time or change cannot alter. And he alone is the one I would trust, simply his word of honor. He has time and opportunity to look after and observe things which you have not. For if your whole mind is not given without distraction to the immense labour before you, it will never be accomplished. Strange to say, I cannot get away from the thought that if Richmond is taken it will, in some way, be your work to do it. I have gone away from my subject. If you are not in his confidence who then is? Fisher will see him here next Sunday, and will talk very freely if you wish it. I know he does not wish to interfere in the least degree unless you wish him to, and does not do or say what I think he might, lest he disturb something you do not want meddled with. You know I thought Col. Shaffer made a mistake in sending for his brothers. I think so still. Too many of a name take up too much room to the hurt of each other. But the Colonel himself is tolerably keen, and will not long endure to be left in doubt. The brother is afraid to say much for he does not know how Shepley stands toward you. Dudley B -- is very well a good way off, and Richardson, Gallager, and that kind I should rather not have about me. I would not have men holding places or trading in my Department to any great extent whom I could not trust at home. They will bring discredit that will worry you hereafter. Forgive me for troubling you with this long letter of such matters, but I hope you will pay some little heed, and not be angry with it. Return this in your next. I do not like to send it very well, but I have written and it shall go. When read put it back in your pocket. I am tired to death writing it."

Dearest: I was very glad to get your note and you came so near not writing it! Were you disappointed when the time came and I was not there? Or are you too busy to notice? Mrs. Grant will not give me much trouble. She is a kind-hearted, unpretending woman. I can make her very happy with very little trouble, unless she is worried about her husband. I have thought still more about Weitzel. I pray you to show him great kindness and attention. He has given up a position superior to the one he now holds simply from preference for you, because he likes you. That in the future, if you win, he will not regret it, I know. But show him by consulting and associating him with whatever you do with Grant, that you appreciate his services. He is the only man you have ever had whose knowledge and judgment are both to be relied on. Keep nothing secret from him, for that is his reward for his perfect fidelity to you. I would sooner have him to lead one Division than anyone I have heard of, but I would still rather have him where he is. A better could not be found. There! have I said enough? You must not say, too much! for I say it wholly from interest for you, which at this time absorbs every other. I look at men with that view and weigh them in that balance, can they serve you? If they are found wanting I pay but little heed to them. Today I am busy with Blanche's clothes that want improving, and in truth I work all the time.

"June 21, 1864","Confidential June 21st, 1864
My dear Shepley: I send you the copies of the Zantzinger papers. I have waited a reasonable time for their exculpatory publication promised in their letter but have heard nothing of it, and I think it due to the cause of justice and right that the whole matter should be published.
It might be prefaced with something like this: ""Governor Pierpont's Pamphlet. We have refrained from making comment on this ‘effort’ of His-would-be-Excellency of Virginia, wherein he set himself up as the Patron Saint of Whiskey-
Smugglers, because we knew investigations were in progress which would reveal at once the justice and propriety of General Butler's action, the guilt of the parties and the complicity of Pierpont with the Whiskey-Smugglers of Norfolk.""
It may be asked what motive could Pierpont have to make this attack on General Butler, in behalf of the Whiskey and Salt Smugglers, and in the language of Daniels, his co-conspirator ‘effect his removal if possible, I hope some day to be successful.’ This may be well asked, for Judas even did not act without a motive. The secret is this; the so called Restored Government of Virginia has no servitors over which to attempt jurisdiction save the cities of Alexandria, Norfolk, and Ports-mouth, all garrisoned by Union troops and under martial law, and its staple revenues are its impositions upon the trade in the shape of licenses, and as bar rooms and corner groceries are peculiarly Southern institutions, if not restrained they would be very prevalent. If the sale of whiskey is stopped by military orders in these cities, the Treasury of the Commonwealth of Virginia would lose its principal support, become bankrupt, and His Excellency get no salary. Besides, if General Butler could be removed, then Zantzinger and Daniels would have a claim for the confiscated whiskey (say $14,000), and could divide with the Governor as they have with Rogers and Sewell as will be seen hereafter. Therefore Pierpont has complained to the War Department of General Clough at Alexandria and of General Butler at Norfolk, because they stopped the indiscriminate sale of whiskey in their commands; and failing to get the bar rooms opened by an order from the War Department, the Governor publishes a pamphlet.
""Pierpont makes Zantzinger and Daniels prefer case of grievance under what he is pleased to call the ‘abuse of military power in the command of General Butler.’ It is the first case which he puts forward as a specimen, and introducing it with a flourish of trumpets, ‘It is incredible. The firm was one of the largest in Norfolk.’ Now he asks the impartial judgment of any man living, what was there in this case to inflict this punishment? Was it (the liquor) smuggled? ‘Zantsinger is the brother-in-law of Commodore Farragut,’ ‘a member of the Loyal Legislature of Virginia.’ ‘Daniels is a loyal business man.’ ‘The animus of General Butler can only be seen by connecting this case with Hodgkins case.’
""General Butler cannot of course re-examine the cases decided in his provost court and acted upon by his Provost
Marshal, nor does he deem it necessary, but as Pierpont had made Zantzinger and Daniels a test case, General Butler determined as soon as his duties would permit to investigate this case in person, and exhibit both the Governor and co-adjuters to the citizens of his department, that they may see of what kind of people the restored Government of Virginia is made.
""The General therefore procured the evidence, which is in the first paper printed below, and then confronted the several guilty parties with it, took their confessions under oath, which established beyond a doubt the following propositions:
""1st That Zantzinger and Daniels smuggled into Norfolk 75 barrels of liquor, 53 of which Pierpont complains Gen'l. Butler confiscated, under the name of ‘Cider Vinegar’ in violation of a military permit.
""2nd. That Zantzinger and Daniels bailed Henry C. Tyler, master of the schooner ‘L. B. Cowperthwait,’ paying $1750.00 to defraud the Government by shipping this liquor and 450 sacks of salt into Norfolk under a forged and false manifest.
""3rd That Zantzinger and Daniels corrupted the revenue officer, Lt. Sewell, by the payment of $750, to pass in this liquor and salt in dereliction of his duty and in fraud of the revenue.
""4th Being put upon their trial before the Provost Court, Zantzinger and Daniels suborned their clerk, Wm. Knight, to commit artful and corrupt perjury to sustain their fraud, well knowing when they called Knight as a witness that he would commit perjury in their behalf.
""5th That Zantzinger and Daniels also suborned Lt. Sewell to cover up his and their crime by deliberate and wilful perjury before the Provost Court, by swearing that Zantzinger and Daniels had no contraband goods on board of vessel consigned to them, when they and Sewell both knew that he was hired to pass in such goods.
""6th That Would-be Governor Pierpont, in his anxiety to make a case against General Butler and to get him removed from his command; so that His Pseudo Excellency's salary might be drawn from the licenses for the sale of whiskey, against the earnest entreaty of Zantzinger and Daniels, who knew justice had been done them and hardly enough of that, designedly persisted in publishing this case as abuse of military power, thus rendering himself an accomplice with smuggler aiders of the enemy, disloyal men, corrupters of officers, bribers and suborners of perjury.
""Of such are the restored Government of Virginia:
""It will further appear from Pierpont's letter to Zantzinger that he now knows the wrong he has done General Butler, and is too base to do justice and recant, although his associates in crime desire now to do so.
""Pierpont has seen how Gov. Meade treats a libeler who endeavored to weaken the confidence of his soldiers and the Government in their commander, and those who know Gen'l. Butler would advise His Whiskey Smuggling, defending Excellency not to come into Gen'l. Butler's department.
""As to Zantzinger and Daniels, we do not suppose that General Butler will punish them farther. He knew from the beginning their crime against the United States, and punished it. He has vindicated the action of the Government and its officers against the accusations of Pierpont and his associate felons, and if they have any farther accusations to bring would be happy to deal with them in like fashion.
He has furnished the Restored Government of Virginia with the fullest evidence that these men and their associates have been guilty of perjury and subornation of perjury, and will now calmly wait to see if that Restored Government has vitality enough to punish such offenders in its principal city, or only strength sufficient to receive license money for selling rotgut whiskey.
""Hodgkins case carries its own refutation with it, in Pierpont's statement. Hodgkins was a soldier in the Rebel army, occupying another rebel's store in Norfolk to sell the goods of another firm who had run away. General Butler advised the Treasury agent, Maj. Moss, to turn Hodgkins out and lease the premises in behalf of the United States to a loyal man, which was done.
‘We can assure Pierpont that any other of his friends and supporters in like condition with Hodgkins will be served the same way as soon as their cases come to the knowledge of General Butler, so that if Pierpont will only disclose the true condition as to loyalty and honesty of his friends in Norfolk, he can get another book of grievances ready in advance.

Dearest: I pity you today; the heat must be intolerable. Even here we can hardly endure it. Tonight, after five, Blanche and I rode up to the light-house. Seven miles, we went entirely up, saw the house where the man who keeps the light lives. It is a bare, sandy spot. About a quarter of a
mile back there is a very fine dense forest. We had scarcely a breeze going or coming. The evening is very warm. I am writing in my night-dress. If Richmond is to be taken by siege, I am afraid you will be there half the summer. How will you be able to endure it? I hope the campaign will not be prolonged in that way. The truth is, I should be glad if we could go home for a time, but that I suppose is not to be talked of now. Farrington and his wife have both been sick, and will return to Lowell next Monday.
Thursday morning. Twenty-one guns were fired this morning. I thought for the President, and have looked for a call ever since. Maybe he did not stop. The guns were a passing salute. It is hotter today than yesterday. Martin is not ready to return before tomorrow. Not positive then. There are quantities of ripe currants in the garden. If I thought you would return here I should make them into jelly. The Democratic convention is postponed to the last of August. A very wise move, I should think. The campaign will last till then.

I HAVE the honor to acknowledge the receipt of your telegram (a copy of which you have forwarded directly to the Lt. General as I am informed) in regard to Colored Troops. From several of its propositions I dissent. Your field return of the 23rd instant gives 7852 Col. Troops for duty, in this despatch you say you have now nearly 5000. What has become of nearly three thousand of these troops in three days? As to Choate's Colored Battery, it has been well-drilled, highly spoken of. I know its commander is a good officer, and he has expressed confidence in his men. In your despatch of the 23rd, upon the authority of your Chief of Artillery, you reported the Col. Battery inefficient. But as that officer is of that class who do not trust any Colored troops, and has since proved his own inefficiency by deliberately riding into the enemy's lines in a fit of drunken or other delirium, as I am informed, and been captured by them. I am not inclined to base much official action on his judgment.
It can be hardly true in fact that the three regiments of Colored Cavalry are yet undrilled in loading their muskets, as one
of these regiments was in the charge for which you have publicly so highly complimented the Colored Troops, and took the works they were ordered to do. If these are not to be depended upon, you have few Colored Troops that can be.
Much as I value Gen. Hinks' services, and I yield to no man more kindly appreciation of them, I should hardly advise the disorganization of his division because of his loss. If, however, the Lt. General choose to carry out a suggestion made by him several days since, and giving to Gen. Burnside the troops of the 9th Army Corps which are now in this department in the Eighteenth Corps, and giving us General Ferrero's Division instead, as you seem to desire this change for the purpose of consolidating the Colored Troops, I will not object. Supposing, however, until now this was against your wish, I have objected, but will now withdraw it and allow the change to be made so far as it rests with me.
As you are entrenching before Petersburg, as you suggest, you will find these good troops to hold entrenchments.
I will forward a copy of this note to the Chief of Staff of the Commanding General, so that he may have our views before him at the same time, although as a rule I would not send forward such communications without an interchange of views.

General: Mr. Dana, Assistant Secretary of War, has just returned. He informs me that he called attention to the necessity of sending General Butler to another field of duty. Whilst I have no difficulty with General Butler, finding him always clear in his conception of orders and prompt to obey, yet there is a want of knowledge how to execute, and particularly a prejudice against him as a commander that operates against his usefulness. I have feared that it might become necessary to separate him and General Smith. The latter is really one of the most efficient officers in the service, readiest in expedients and most skilful in the management of troops in action. I would dislike removing him from his present command unless it was to increase it, but, as I say, may have it to do yet if General Butler remains. As an administrative officer General Butler has no superior. In taking charge of a Department where there are no great battles to be fought, but a dissatisfied element to control, no one could manage it better than he.
If a command could be cut out such as Mr. Dana proposed, namely Kentucky, Illinois, and Iowa, or if the Departments of the Missouri, Kansas, and the States of Illinois and Iowa could be merged together and General Butler put over it, I believe
the good of the service would be subserved. I regret the necessity of asking for a change in commander here, but General Butler not being a soldier by education or experience, is in the hands of his subordinates in the execution of all operations military. I would feel strengthened with Smith, Franklin, or J. J. Reynolds commanding the right wing of this army. At the same time, as I have here stated, General Butler has always been prompt in his obedience to orders with me and clear in his understanding of them. I would not therefore be willing to recommend his retirement. I send this by mail for consideration, but will telegraph if I think it absolutely necessary to make a change.

It was foreseen from the first that you would eventually find it necessary to relieve General B. on account of his total unfitness to command in the field, and his general quarrelsome character. What shall be done with him, has therefore already been, as I am informed, a matter of consultation. To send him to Kentucky would probably cause an insurrection in that State, and an immediate call for large re-inforcements. Moreover, he would probably greatly embarrass Sherman, if he did not attempt to supersede him, by using against him all his talent at political intrigue and his facilities for newspaper abuse. If you send him to Missouri, nearly the same thing will occur there. Although it might not be objectionable to have a free fight between him and Rosecrans, the Government would be seriously embarrassed by the local difficulties and calls for re-enforcements likely to follow. Inveterate as is Rosecrans' habit of continually calling for more troops, Butler differs only in demanding instead of calling. As things now stand in the West, I think we can keep the peace; but if Butler be thrown in as a disturbing element, I anticipate very serious results. Why not leave General Butler in the local command of his department, including North Carolina, Norfolk, Fort Monroe, Yorktown, &c., and
make a new army corps of the part of the Eighteenth under Smith? This would leave [Butler] under your immediate control, and at the same time would relieve you of his presence in the field. Moreover, it would save the necessity of organizing a new department. If he must be relieved entirely, I think it would be best to make a new department for him in New England. I make these remarks merely as suggestions. Whatever you may finally determine on, I will try to have done. As General B[utler] claims to rank me, I shall give him no orders whereon he may go, without the special direction of yourself or the Secretary of War.
Yours truly, H. W. Halleck"

General: In acknowledging your despatch with reference to my leave, I consider it due to you, who have been so kind to me, and to myself who has never had anything but the warmest wish for your success and for the prosperous termination of this war, to render some explanation. One of my troubles, that of my head, has three times driven me from a southern climate, and I really feel quite helpless here, unable to go out at all during the heat of the day even to visit my lines, and therefore I do not do the duty of a corps commander as I think it should be done. I have during this war held my health and my life at the service of the country when I thought I was doing any good, and as I stand now, unfortunately, and as I think I can say with the clearest conscience from no fault of my own, I have deemed that some other with more ambition
and no hostilities could better serve the country here in my place; therefore, I was in nowise called upon to risk a permanent disability by remaining here. I wish to say to you, unofficially, that from the time I joined the Department of Virginia until the campaign terminated disgracefully, I gave to the work the utmost energies of mind and body. Then I wanted to be where I could be useful, and, thinking the more troops there were in this department the more blunders and murders would be committed, I went gladly to the Army of the Potomac with the most hearty good will and intentions. In looking back over the sneers and false charges and the snubbings I received there I only wonder, general, at my own moderation. I then came back, thinking that your presence here would prevent blunders, and that I could once more be useful. Two letters have been written to me which I think any gentleman would be ashamed to acknowledge as emanating from him, and for which there was not even the shadow of an excuse. This has induced me to believe that some one else would be of far more service here than I am. And as my only ambition is to be of service, I determined to present the just plea of my health to remove one of the obstacles to harmony in this army, and that, general, if you will look closely into the campaign, you will find to be one of the causes of want of success when you needed and expected it. In conclusion, general, I am willing to do anything and endure anything which will be of service to the country or yourself. Now I am through with the personal, and I want simply to call your attention to the fact that no man since the Revolution has had a tithe of the responsibility which now rests on your shoulders, and to ask you how you can place a man in command of two army corps who is as helpless as a child on the field of battle, and as visionary as an opium eater in council, and that, too, when you have such men as Franklin and Wright available to help you, to make you famous for all time, and our country great and free beyond all other nations of the world? Think of it, my dear general, and let your good sense and not your heart decide questions of this kind.

Gen. Smith telegraphed me this afternoon that six regts. of infantry, 22 army wagons, and 26 ambulances passed over the turnpike toward Richmond, and also a train of cars loaded with troops and a battery. A deserter from Foster's front at Deep Bottom reports that Cook and Kirkland's Brigades of Hettis Division of Hill's Corps have left there, and that there is now in front of Foster -- Davis Brigade of Hettis Division and Lane's and Conner's Brigades of Wilcox' Division of Hill's Corps with one regt. from Gracie's Brigade. These troops have gone there within two days. Another deserter, just in, reports that Pickett's Division is being withdrawn from our front, their place to be supplied by batteries of reserve militia, who are to hold our lines while Pickett's Division is to cross the Appomattox. He also reports Gen. Early present in person but does not know of his Division. He states that his officers say that there is to be a flank movement. This may possibly be a movement against Meade's left. The troops that Smith reports going up may be the reserves to take the place of Pickett's veteran troops, that are to cross the Appomattox. I have thought the man's story of sufficient consequence to send him to you for examination in addition to this synopsis of his information. He reports, also, felling the trees by the enemy in our front, which would show that they do not mean a movement upon us. By careful question you may be able to make something more out of him.
It is quite possible that an attack, which will probably be a feint, will be made on Foster, while a real attack will be made on Meade's left, and this may be the flank movement spoken of.

I desire to add the following to my last despatch: When General Smith left here to re-enforce General Meade at Cold Harbor, he applied for a regular engineer officer. Although with the great deal of work on hand here I had only two, I gave him Captain Farquhar, the older of the two. On his return he permitted Captain Farquhar to delay several days at Fortress Monroe, and when he was ordered to Petersburg applied for Lieutenant Michie, who could not be spared. Now, again without consulting General Butler or myself, he again permits Farquhar to go and again applies for Lieutenant Michie, who can be spared less now than ever. I respectfully protest against any officer holding a position junior to these headquarters applying for one of the officers in my department by name. He has the right to apply for an officer to perform certain duties if required, and then it becomes my duty to procure one if I have none on hand to send. If General Smith can by any means get my only reliable assistant detailed from me, it presumes either that he knows more about my department than I do, or that I am not capable to preside over the department. It is certainly not right for him to apply direct to you; and is in direct disobedience of a general order from Lieutenant-General Grant promulgated about the beginning of this campaign.

Blanche's dress to be finished next Wednesday. The tea was delicious. Nobody has nice tea but us. When one is tired there is no restorative like it. That is evident, for I came weary and silent from the boat, now I am flippant in writing, and could walk round the ramparts if it were not raining. No, it is not raining this moment, but the leaves are trembling and swaying, and the clouds darkening. Hundreds of martin birds are twittering and hovering close down to my windows. They will have to fly for shelter or the storm will catch them. There they rush back and forth close down to me, oh what a cloud of them! The silly things, they don't care for the thunder or rain. Oh me, what a tremendous crash! The lightning flew a dozen ways, and the birds have shot out of sight.

Colonel Comstock is going out this morning, and will explain to you my idea. If the approaches are made it will be with the view of ultimately making an assault on the enemy's lines, but I have always hoped to go through in General Butler's front so as to carry the north bank of Swift Creek. This, however, cannot be done until the Nineteenth Corps arrives, without giving up too much ground that we have already fought for. This would make no difference, except in case of failure to get through to Swift Creek. The advantage of commencing our regular approaches on your front now would simply be that we would be that far advanced if we were compelled at last to advance in that way, and it would tend to divert the enemy from the proposed advance in General Butler's front. We ought by all means to cut the Weldon road so as to make it useless to enemy. I think Wright's two divisions should take the place of Hancock's corps, and the latter should support the cavalry whilst it destroys the road down as far as Hicksford. Preparations for this, I think, should be made at once so as to start from your left by the night of the 10th.

I also find that the permit granted Todd & Co. for Gardner has been badly managed. Neither of them put a dollar of capital into the business, and in order to do business have been compelled to give most of the profit to Daniels and cattle like him, so that what was supposed to be a favor to friends has actually been used to make money for men who are not entitled to any consideration whatever from the authorities.
I think their permits to sell liquor in Norfolk and to send goods up river had better be revoked, and the permits given such person as Bill and Hildreth may want. I don't care much, only I think at least a giving of the favors should go to our friends.
I have been so extremely cautious about favoring any one that would appear to be connected with me that it has resulted in enriching enemies. I would rather you would sign and send the order to me as you have managed the whole affair with Daniels, besides it is entirely proper to close them out.
I wish you could find a man of brains and dignity for Provost Marshal. There is no use disguising the fact, Weldon is not fit in any sense of the word, he has not one qualification. You could transfer him to Bermuda, to deal with deserters, prisons, etc. Your man Hutchins had better be transferred to another field. He is injuring you in many ways, is a bad man.
Webster is not the man for his place. He is very slow, and
has no sort of an idea of proper punishment to inflict on culprits. I don't believe you can find any man who has not had experiences in the army, to do any better, but if you could find some officer that was a lawyer, it would be much better.
I have faith that Colonel Sanders would be infinitely better for the criminal business, as he is quick and severe. Stackpole says he is the best man on court martial he has ever seen. Could not the business of the court be divided into criminal and civil? Let Webster run the civil. As soon as the other courts are all divided up in Portsmouth and Norfolk, the business will be heavy, besides there should be a court here that you could send cases from the front to be tried. I think Sanders would convict on whatever evidence was sent him.
I am very little better than when I came down. I felt better yesterday morning, but when I returned from Norfolk I was used up. However, should anything turn up, telegraph me and I can under the circumstances run ten days.
I see Paine is appointed Brig. I am very anxious that the negroes should be organized into a solid and compact organization, say Duncan and Draper for Brigade Commanders and Paine Div. I would make Weitzel turn his attention a little to putting the cavalry in shape. Ludlow should get orders from Grant for horses, and go to Washington after them. I learn that Grant has sent Barnard off, -- don't let him have Weitzel at any price.
I am waiting until Mrs. Butler returns to learn what that delegation was after. If you can manage any way to command the 18th Corps, or get a commander for it, I would let Smith have his sick leave, -- he only asked it of Grant to force Grant into giving him an independent command; there is nothing honest about him. I would have Weitzel spend as much time as possible in having the troops all got in perfect shape, so that you can tell any day just how many there are and under whose command. We have too many detachments disconnected from both Corps.
Now, General, I have written plainly, and I know you will take it as it is meant, for God knows that but for your sake I would not remain here ten minutes longer, for I believe that every day I remain here in service tells on my constitution more than three months away from the army would, but as I have said before, I will see you through as far as (The remainder of this letter is missing)"

My dear Mr. Clark: Dr. Brown Sequard, the very eminent Paris physician for many years -- now here -- has carefully seen and examined Maj. Bell. Dr. Upham tells me that the opinion of Dr. S. is the best in the world of such diseases, that he says the later symptoms of Maj. Bell, of which I wrote you, are not alarming, nor necessarily bad, that the Major has congestion without ""effusion"" -- that the congestion continues -- that it may be a year before it can be determined whether he will recover or not -- and that he, Dr. S. has known recovery, full as I understood Dr. Upham, in as bad cases. My inference from what the Dr. told me was that the Major may have something like an even chance of recovery, in his, Dr. Upham's, judgment. Of that chance I imagine Dr. Sequard did not speak so strongly.
I think Ed. E. Hale in the Advertizer and I in the Transcript have set Gen'l. Butler pretty nearly right here. When the right opportunity offers I will say more, -- I mean of the mean attacks-upon his military eareer at Bermuda Hundred. I know enough of Gillmore to stamp him as a ""poor cuss.""

I have sent for Gen. Brooks to consult with him to see where if possible we can spare troops for you.
As you had made no application to me for any additional force, while I knew such force would be desirable, yet I felt the necessity for them here was great, and therefore had not ordered them forwarded.

reasons for not forwarding them sooner are that I had a conversation upon the subject with the lieutenant-general, in which your recommendations were substantially to be carried out, as a portion of them have already been. The colored battery has been withdrawn from the front and sent for drill to Portsmouth, in order that the experiment of using negroes for artillery may be tested fully.

My dear General Butler: You see I have given up, very unwillingly, the idea of returning to you at present. I came home to find my wife sick and confined to her room, which she only left to-day; my brother off for Egypt, unexpectedly soon; my assistant taking care of Grant's wounded at Port Royal, my country home here going to the dogs for somebody to look after it. I have done what I could to straighten out this imbroglio; but I cannot cut my cable.
Meanwhile I have a thousand things to say to you, for there is not an hour when I am not talking of you and my ""campaign.""
1st. I have tried to send you before this the precise weight of a cord half a mile long, which will hold a balloon of 450 lbs. lifting power. But I have not yet got the proper estimate.
2d. I came down James River with the paroled-surgeons of Averill's command, fresh from the Libby. They implored me, by all that was holy, to see that the proper parties sent private boxes of provision to our officers in the Libby, 66 in number then; and Dr. Ferguson told me that the rebel Dr. Semple, in charge of Hospital No. 21 (where our wounded are), promised sacredly that any chloroform & brandy sent to him should be used for our wounded. I have attended to both their requests.
I am afraid I have driven Major Mulford crazy by the number of packages and boxes which have been sent him for officers, ""by their friend,"" under my direction. He notifies us that he is not able to go up now. I suppose you all mean to go into Richmond so soon as to give him no chance, but this is to beg you to send him up as soon as the military exigency will permit, it's only for these supplies' sake & those who need them.
3d. The little Hickory; a ""very young hickory"" got to Lowell within 48 hours after it left your marquee. But Mr. Pierson has never notified me of its arrival. I hope he has you; and that we may yet sit under its umbrage with patent nut-crackers bruising the fruit, and telling the stories of victory.
4th and in especial. I called on Major Bell Sunday night. But he does not see company now, having, I fancy, over-exerted himself by seeing too many people. I saw Mrs. Bell, who was in very good spirits about him. She says he is improving, and that Dr. Brown Sequard, the celebrated French student of those diseases, promises them a complete recovery. She was enthusiastic about the cordiality and hospitality of the Department of Virginia, and begged to be remembered to you & Mrs. Butler most heartily.
5th. (I hope you appreciate these numerical divisions, and see that I have not been ""in the field"" for nothing.) Since I undertook this note, which you will call so formidable, my neighbor John M. Forbes has been in to tell me his son Will is a prisoner. I am very sorry for this. You remember the lad, for you went to his trial when the College Corporation fought him; and I believe that you do not worship the Corporation more heartily than I do. Will you ask Major Mulford to find out what he can about him, and if there should be any chance to relieve him -- why there are lots of us who would be glad. Forbes, the father, tells me he has written to you enclosing a letter to his son. He is about the most efficient man in Massachusetts; enough more to do, with what is of real use than the Governor, one of the few men of the conservative training who now takes the really democratic instead of the Girondist or precedent view of this war of ours.
Pray try to think of some service I can render you here, and do not be surprised if you see me some evening in the close of the summer. Only I shall never come as a visitor, unless I can go to work. I should feel as if honest men had a right to spit at me. There is good chance that I may be drafted, in which case some day, as a tall, round-shouldered sentinel presents
arms to the staff, Shaffer will say ""that man looks like the Doctor,"" and you will see that the fellow-citizen holding his musket two inches from the end of his nose is

My dearest Wife: I wrote you a very mysterious epistle yesterday because I was in doubt myself.
I had just received an order from Washington (which may the Rebels take), appointing Smith to the command of the troops serving under him, and the remainder of the troops in the department to be under the Command of Maj. Gen'l. Butler, headqrs. Fortress Monroe. Immediately after breakfast I went to Gen. Grant, as I had seen him the night before and was treated by him with the utmost cordiality, and had a confidential conference. I could not tell why this order should come out and he not have mentioned it then. He received me with cordial greeting. As soon as possible after the usual compliments, and the staff had retired, I showed him the order, and told him I did not understand it. He says, ""Oh, -- I did not mean you should have seen that order. It is a mistake. I suppressed all the copies that were transmitted through me. How did you get this?"" ""Some friend in the War Department, fearing perhaps I should not see it, forwarded me one direct,"" said I. ""Well,"" said he, ""I don't want this at all. I want Smith to report to you -- you to have the full command. I was going to add the 19th corps to your department, and I shall when it comes here from Washington. I will telegraph now."" He then telegraphed that he had suspended the order, and that he desired that Gen. Franklin be ordered to report to me for active duty in the field as soon as he was able to take the saddle, and so the order has gone up. This was the work of Halleck upon the application of Smith, but it has failed, and I have gained by it. From Grant's suspension of the
order, and saying that he proposed to have the 19th corps added to my command, he has vindicated me and my military operations in a way it would not have been done but for these people -- whom God and his humble instrument will take care of before we get through.
So you see I shall not come to Fortress Monroe as soon as you thought and I hoped. But the mail closes. Read this to Shaffer.

I have sent no troops to Baltimore except Ricketts' division and the dismounted cavalry. Two divisions, the balance of the Sixth Corps, are now on their way to Washington, the advance having sailed at 10 A. M. The remainder are embarking and starting as fast as the steamers are loaded. I have sent General Ord to Washington. I would give more for him as a commander in the field than most of the generals now in Maryland. Probably it would be well to send him to Baltimore to command and hold the place, forcing into service for the purpose, if necessary, all citizens capable of bearing arms. He should also have discretion to move out against the enemy. All other force, it looks to me, should be collected in rear of the enemy about Edward's Ferry, and follow him up and cut off retreat if possible. All losses sustained by loyal citizens can be paid back to them by contributions collected from rebel sympathizers after the enemy is got rid of.

He thinks that with the 100-days' men and invalids we have here we can defend Washington, and scarcely Baltimore. Besides these there are about 8,000, not very reliable, under Howe at Harper's Ferry, with Hunter approaching that point very slowly, with what number I suppose you know better than I.
Wallace, with some odds and ends and part of what came up with Ricketts was so badly beaten yesterday at Monocacy that what is left can attempt no more than to defend Baltimore. What we shall get in from Pennsylvania and New York will scarcely be worth counting, I fear. Now, what I think is that you should provide to retain your hold where you are, certainly, and bring the rest with you personally, and make a vigorous effort to destroy the enemy's force in this vicinity. I think there is really a fair chance to do this if the movement is prompt. This is what I think, upon your suggestion, and is not an order.

A communication is forwarded to you from Risley, whether sufficient or not I have no knowledge not having seen it. I must say, however, I have but little confidence in Lane. I do not believe he can be trusted a great way at a time.
Now, if you have the right, I want you should give Lewis N. Barlow, Capt. of Steamer ""Relief,"" a permit to run her from New York to Norfolk carrying such freight as may be permitted by the military authorities. I think the boat can do a paying business in this line -- at any rate better than laying at New York at $20 a day expense.
I also want a permit for myself to come to & from this department. And, if it is not bothering you too much, I should like permits for James M. Renshaw, Mr. Wadleigh, & W. H. Clemence to come here. I shall not use them unless I am satisfied it is best on my arrival home & full consultation. If you shall send these permits, & the permit to run the steamer, enclose them all to me & direct to Lowell.
The reason I ask for another for myself is, the officer at the boat at Baltimore thought the one I have was too long ago, so I gave him one I had from Col. Wooley, though I do not think
he would have absolutely refused to let me come on the old one of yours.
I do not wish to be understood as desiring to say anything to delay Lane in getting his cargo released as quickly as possible. I only say my confidence in the man is by no means so full as I should desire in matters where strict integrity & honor are necessary -- he might abuse his privileges.
Truly yours, Fisher"

Dearest: Your letter is written in great good spirits. For your sake I am rejoiced that Grant sustains you. For me, I am sorry we are not to see you. I must write, in my old way, some few things that seem to me important. Do not attempt with Grant anything against those officers. Unless he takes the lead, suggest nothing against them. Do not speak of them to your own officers. The quarrel is too heavy and no advantage to you. Gillmore has injured you already. Add to the quarrel three other officers of more ability, and Grant himself cannot sustain it. Do every possible thing to aid and assist Grant, tax your mind to the utmost and give it entirely to his service, with the difference that all men in power are quick to perceive. Without servility, let him feel that you are truly and firmly his friend, ready to espouse his quarrels, troubling him but little with your own. Give your whole mind to help him whip the rebels. If you do this, and he has the penetration to look at it rightly, you will supply any deficiency that may exist in him, and win for yourself what you have never yet had in this war, a friend so high in power that he can help you in the hour of danger. Tell him that Mrs. Butler is disappointed that Mrs. Grant did not come. The journey is too long for a short vacation. I expected her for the campaign. If Gen. Weitzel is sick, let him come down and stay with Mr. Webster for a few days. Oh, dearest, I have written you a long letter. I can never feel right till you have seen and read it. And then I wish you to answer it in person. I know not when to send it, for I do not wish a private grief of mine to mar a public act of yours. I shall not be able while this heat lasts to go up to you. I feel too tired to do much, and have grown thin, Lauretta says, since she came down. So, as I cannot go to you, I do not see but you must come to me. Blanche is half inclined to go home for a little. What do you think of it? She sends love.
Yours, affectionately, Sarah
Thursday
Morning.
Dearest: Your letter of the 10th did not come till this morning. Is it not provoking? We are anxious for news; but we had ascertained nearly how it stood. You are right, it is a perfect vindication of your cause that Grant upholds you. Fisher said so at once when we found Grant had taken it into his own hands. I am thankful, love, for you. You could be so wretched if sent back here. Hold firmly to the hand that helps you. Do not feel too sure that the storm is over."
"July, 1864","Fortress Monroe, July -th, 1864
Dearest: Your letter came while Genl. Weitzel and Dr. McCormick were with us. After some consideration I read a part of your letter to them. Weitzel who had been wavering, doubtful, if he had better go to N. York, instantly decided he would not. Both were delighted that Grant had given the command to you. It is the highest endorsement and compliment that he could show you. (It means the whole army, does it not?) But both of them believe that a movement made with the army of the Potomac would be almost sure to be failure, and fatal to you. But I need not urge this on your attention, because Weitzel instantly rose to write you a letter. He will give you his reasons much more fully than I should be able to give them. The Dr. has gone North alone. Genl. Weitzel and Blanche have driven up the beach, where he encamps. She will return alone. I ran upstairs to write you before dark. How variable, how strange, you must think me! Yet I am not so. Only foolish that I cannot always forget myself. I know that what I should do is to cheer, and encourage. But if I could always do it, it would be so like a machine. It may be you would prefer to take me as I am. Fitful, wayward sometimes, but a very loving wife. More ready to show devotion and tenderness in adversity than in your proudest hours of triumph. You have doubted this. You never need to doubt it more. Pride, that I once thought a ruling element, is subject and overborne by tenderness, sympathy, and other gentler feelings. Perhaps the first has passed away, and the others have grown stronger. Whatever it may be, I feel very tenderly toward you, and do not like to see you troubled. I wish you were here to go out with us to bethe. I am almost afraid to go. I do not feel sure that the
water is beneficial to me. I get tired more easily than ever before. This is a long and hot summer. I hope if we live for another we shall pass it farther North.

I don't know what you can say to him, as I don't know what you promised Gardner. One thing is certain, that the people here or in Norfolk wondered that you let Daniels run as long as you did.

I am truly sorry that your health is not sufficient for your duties, for I know you desire to be at your post, and I trust that a few days' rest will bring you all right. We have had the devil to pay here for a few days in consequence of the present raid. The whole thing looks as if our troops had made special effort to assist the enemy to steal all they wanted, and now news comes that they have all got safely back south of the river. If this man Halleck is permitted to control any military matters all will go to the devil, as it has heretofore when he has had a finger in it. If the Lord would be kind enough to take Mary to himself and send Halleck to the devil, it would help the country materially. If Lincoln is not defeated, it will not be for want of special effort on his part. The truth is, Shaffer, I am perfectly discouraged in regard to Lincoln, and I am not sure but his defeat would benefit the country.
Washburn has gone home, will return here early in August. Things at home look well, and if the two northern districts will do their duty the old program can be carried out.

General: Assuming that this position in the peninsula of Bermuda Hundreds will not be abandoned, at least during the war, whatever may be the necessities of operations or the results of movements elsewhere, and specially in view of operations on the south side of Richmond, I take leave to suggest to the Commanding General the propriety of constructing a railroad from the landing at Bermuda Hundreds to our front. The route is very practicable, and I will have it run out. Whenever we advance, the road can be easily carried forward and make a junction with the Petersburg road. There is iron enough for the purpose at Norfolk and Fortress Monroe, and while we are remaining here the road might be easily built by a force detailed
from the hundred days' men the timber for ties being directly along the road.
I observe that owing to the contraction of space for wharf room at City Point, between the ravine and the Appomattox, it is impossible to get wharfage enough there to land all the supplies, so that large sums are being expended for demurrage, although the vessels lay six (6) or seven (7) deep along the whole extent of wharf.
The wharves at Bermuda Hundreds need not be more than fifty (50) feet in width to get the deepest water, and the entire expense of putting them in order and constructing the railroad, to the United States, would be saved by one week's necessary demurrage as it exists at present. Of course, in this I mean no criticism upon General Ingalls, who seems to be doing the best he can in the space he occupies.
I am aware of the cost of labor for loading and unloading stores from vessels, but as we advance I trust we shall be able to obtain that labor at a cheap rate. We should have had a surplus of it here if Kautz & Wilson's return had not been interrupted with the negroes they were bringing in with them.
It is quite possible that hereafter at some central point it may be necessary to make a depot for the recruitment and disciplining of negro troops, in the necessity of garrisoning the Southern Country. For that purpose I know no better point than this. Healthy, easily defended, good water, plenty of wood and easy of access, a garrison, which should control Richmond, Petersburg, and all the country east of the Chowan River, and therefore Norfolk, Portsmouth, and Suffolk, might be most conveniently located here. Besides, there will be land enough here for the safe location of a large colony of Freedmen. Indeed, if the war should proceed further South, and last any time, I do not see why this would not be as convenient a location as any for prisoners, with the negroes on hand to guard them.
I venture to submit these suggestions to the attention of the Commanding General. I have the honor to be,

Now about your own and Grant's movements. This is the point of time when he will make or undo himself. The country is at the critical point, ready to applaud or condemn on the

Can you not send half of the cavalry across the country to cut them off, and have enough left to help strike a blow at Lee where you are? This must be Grant's time for action, is it not? Go to him every day, if he will take it kindly, and think, think, think by what stratagem these fellows can be whipped. Consult with Weitzel, I am so sorry he is out of health, he cannot do justice to himself in that state. Do not take him on long rides or he will be entirely disabled. I have an idea our leaders do not think deeply, and are amazed at every new move of the rebels, rather than prepared to take advantage of the changes. We hear that Meade is ordered to Washington with all the troops, but that cannot be so. I would hold for Richmond if I were Grant, if Washington fell to ashes. Forget all quarrels, and act alone to aid Grant to win success. Oh me! Why do I get excited over this? Will it change one feature of my life whichever way it turns? But it is folly to think of that.

I have also examined General Order No. 257, instructions intended to promote the efficiency of the cavalry service. If you will do me the favor I will examine any other papers which you may choose to submit to me. So far as I can ascertain from this order and from these papers your duties here in this Dept. will be those of a Special and Assistant Inspector of Cavalry. You will therefore make your inspections according to the instructions given you contained in these written instructions, and any further instructions you may receive through my Inspector General. I understood in conversation that you supposed it was your duty to forward your reports directly to Washington. I entertain different views of your duties, but as it is a matter of form only I am not inclined to interfere with your forwarding special reports, provided duplicates are also sent to my Inspector General's Office. I feel bound to say to you that if the Cavalry Bureau at Washington had chosen to examine my Inspector General's reports up to the last month, they would have found every item of intelligence there which so far as I can learn you are required to give, saving always your own opinions upon the efficiency and propriety of action of my cavalry officers, and I know that the opinions which you will give of your own, being those of a young cavalry officer of three years' standing, will be modestly and properly expressed. Any further instructions I can give you, or any other aid that I can furnish which in your judgment will promote the efficiency of the cavalry of this Department, will be as promptly furnished as is this note, as you will do me the favor to remember that I have but this moment received the order under which you are acting. I would suggest to you, however, that the 12th New York Cavalry at Newbern, N. C., is not in as satisfactory condition as I could wish, and perhaps as the division of cavalry at this point will leave very shortly upon a raid, not to return before the end of the month, you will find leisure to examine into the condition of the cavalry forces in North Carolina. I desire also to call your special attention to the insufficiency of arms with which my cavalry is furnished, and if this Bureau can have any effect in promoting the efficiency of cavalry, it can do more in this direction than any other, and in answering my requisition for horses which has been before them for three months without any notice.

In the view of Gillmore's being restored to command; of the attacks made upon me; the spies and others set over me by this abortion of a Government, I am sometimes about to give up the contest, and leave all to go home and be quiet. But I must struggle on. There is nothing new here, nothing. We are waiting till Lee's troops get back from Maryland well-laden with spoils. Then we shall move. If the Washington people could have had a little more constancy, could have stood up a little better, then we should not have been obliged to send our troops away and stop operations. But so it has ever been. I am in doubt whether it would not have been better for the rebels to have burnt Washington.

Blanche is urging to stay. Lauretta and Florence have gone out with her to drive on the beach. If Fisher returns, they expect to leave tomorrow. I am in doubt if I should keep her or not. Her dresses I could arrange well enough, but I fear for her fresh young face. If her rich color dies out she will look as wan as I do. That makes me think of Lauretta's remark to me yesterday: ""When I boarded at your house on Central Street, your complexion was perfect. When you came down in the morning it was clear and dewy, with the loveliest pink in your cheeks, beautiful to look at."" Now you must not think me vain, that I recall this vision of youth and write it to you; for I lie here so pale and wearied, so unattractive, that I would fain present some bright season of life when I was looked at with pleasure, and loved, by those who felt the inspiration of my nature. -- Love, that they can never forget while life exists. It came, not from the romance of the school-girl that dies at twenty, but the impassioned woman that art, beauty, and heroic deeds forever stimulate and exult, that cannot fatten from thirty to sixty and waddle through life neglected and self-complaisant. My head aches writing in bed, and I do not know if you can read it. When shall I send you the letter I spoke of, or when shall I see you? Delay will waste me to nothing. Fisher says you will make no move at present. Perhaps for you, it is better not. Not so for Grant. Politics is all there is of it. I wrote you a letter about Shepley, and sent it while you were coming down here. You have not returned it to me. Look for it, I would not like others to see it. Tell me if you found it on your return from here. Your note yesterday was very kind. Today you had not time to write. Pray answer my questions. When shall I send my letter and when shall I see you?
Yours affectionately, Sarah"

My dear Wife: I am grieved to hear that you are unwell -- pray get up again at once. Do, dearest, that is a good girl. I will see you if I can. I would give much to do so, but at present we are getting ready for a movement as soon as the troops return. I think you had better run home with Blanche for ten days, and get a snuff of fresh air, and then we shall have got over with our present movement. There is nothing, absolutely nothing to tell here. There are some political movements which Fisher will tell you, as it is not best to write them.
Can't you scratch me a line -- a word or two on the back of Blanche's note. I was very lonely last night at the news of your illness, and early went to bed but not to sleep. I wish you would write.

Dearest: Do not trouble about me -- I have been up most of today. Your note came this afternoon -- it was very kind -- and I very glad to get it. Fisher and family left tonight Blanche was so unwilling to leave me that she has stayed behind. They did not urge her at last, because they seemed to think I was not well enough to be left alone. That ought not to have kept her. In a few days I shall be as well, I hope, as usual. The journey home, to return soon, is too wearisome for me -- I must wait awhile. Wait, till I have seen you. That will be better. Mrs. Shaffer came this morning. Her
baggage is lost on the way. Of course she is troubled about it, but it may come in a day or two. Shaffer thinks there will be no movement until the troops are all returned. That will take three weeks before you will be entirely ready. Can you not give two days to one who needs it as I do, before you enter into deadly strife? Think of it, dearest, for my sake, and write to me if I may send a letter the day after you answer this, that I can be sure will reach you!

Several deserters just in on General Meade's front, who left the picket-line tonight, concur in the statement that we are to be attacked tonight. General Field visited their line just before they deserted, and they overheard him talking with a colonel on the details of the movement. They say it is conceded in their army that Johnston is gone, unless he can be re-enforced, and before they can re-enforce him we must be driven back. Have the Tenth and Eighteenth Corps duly notified, with caution, however, that they are to make no demonstration to show that we are expecting any such attack. Be prepared at the same time to take advantage of any abandonment by the enemy of his lines in your front, especially after daylight in the morning. Of course it is not known when the attack is to be, or whether it is to be at all, but we want to be prepared for the enemy if he should give us such an advantage.

My dearest Love: Do you not think that there are others who remember those roses beside Lauretta? Nay more, that see nothing else now. That memory is ever present with one -- and the vision most frequently recalled -- most usually -- is the fresh-cheeked rosy girl with the flowing curls, rosier than Blanche, more graceful, but not so graceful as now.
Ah me! If you would and could only believe what I know and feel you would not write to me so sadly. Do not stop your letters if you can write in no other strain, for I sadly miss them.

"July 18, 1864","Private. Cincinnati, July 18th, 1864
Major General B. F. Butler, Fortress Monroe, Va.
Dear Sir: Enclosed I send you copy of letter just sent Major General Fremont. It speaks for itself.
Thousands of our best and most influential citizens of this city (and they but indicate a very general and growing sentiment all through the North) who voted for Lincoln, and who to-day are only Lincoln men from pure necessity, fearing in a change of getting a worse man, are anxiously looking for some chance to secure with a certainty a competent, loyal President, in the place of our present imbecile incumbent, and his cabinet and surroundings.
Your course has been such as to inspire confidence in your loyalty and ability for such a position. The exigencies of our country demand your election in preference to any man the war has developed. You have not hesitated to take advanced steps, and to trust your own interests and standing with a people that you have promptly and fearlessly furnished with your just decisions when they have instinctively approved of the same, and responded with a wish that you were the President in the place of a man with neither the ability nor patriotism to thus act.
Our country has been awfully scourged in the loss of its army, navey, and treasures, to gratify a conservative party in sympathy with the President. The main progress of the President has been more from force of circumstances and complaints of the people than from any inherent force with the President and his Cabinet. His fooleries have well-nigh exhausted the patriotism and confidence of the loyal people, and he may be credited for much of the disloyal sentiment of the North.
Had his nomination been put off, as I urged in the National Union Association of this city, 2 months, he could not have got it. The President of said Association said to me to-day that if you would run, and get the support of the War Democrats and Fremont Party, that he would support you, and Lincoln would be greatly defeated as he ought to be.
You have no conception of the change, and I hope that the policy indicated in my letter to General Fremont will be adopted. There is a way to bring that about. You have friends that might induce Fremont to favor and recommend this policy. If you can have it done, my word for it you will see such a spontaneous
uprising as the country has never seen. As to the Peace Democrats, and the few adhering to Lincoln, they would be nowhere.
We want a government, or we shall fall to pieces. Our domestic and foreign enemies must be made to feel that we have a Government afraid of nothing but to do wrong, negatively or positively.
Prompt action on the part of your friends will set the ball in motion, and all of Lincoln's office-holders can't stop it. I will work for you like a dog, and ask for nothing but the satisfaction of relieving my afflicted country from the double curse of a positive rebellion, and a negative Govt. incompetent to put it down.
I am not a politician or office-holder, and never was. I voted for Fillmore, Clay, Harrison, and Lincoln. I don't want to be compelled to vote again for such a man. ""Sumter"" counted me into a radical to meet radicals.
Your style suits me and the North, and if, as some say, while your are smarter than Lincoln, you are not as honest as ""Abe,"" I reply by saying that were you elected and to keep a pack of thieves around you, you could not steal more than Abe's friends do.
General Fremont can't be elected anyway, not even by aid of Peace Democrats, as in case they two unite, the War Democrats and Union Party will unite with Lincoln. But let War Democrats nominate you with the understanding that Fremont will retire, and advise his friends to unite in you, and they too will immediately receive more than enough of support from men like myself to settle your selection.
I have thus frankly expressed what I know is the feeling and judgment of our best men, all over this country. I have no other motive in thus expressing myself but that which should prompt a good citizen. Your standing is such that it may be made available by above policy, if promptly carried out.
It would be praiseworthy in you to give proper direction to an object, so much needed by an afflicted country, and I trust you will promptly do so. I am very respectfully,
Your obdt. Servant, Edgar Conkling,

"July 18, 1864","Confidential. Cincinnati, July 18th, 1864
Major General J. C. Fremont, New York
Dear Sir: A sense of duty constrains me to frankly address you, suggesting what I think will fully harmonize with your views, as expressed in your letter of acceptance of the Cleveland Convention.
I agree with you that Mr. Lincoln has failed in many important respects, and I am glad to see that a large portion of those having voted for him, with myself, are seeking to see how they may safely vote for another, and greatly more competent and loyal to the principles essential to a speedy quelling this rebellion, and its cause and support.
I understand that you would retire in case it would render it certain that Mr. Lincoln could be defeated by a good and true Union President. As I understand it, Mr. Lincoln is certain to be elected unless the War Democrats and Fremont Party can unite on some ticket satisfactory to those who will forsake Lincoln for it. If such an arrangement can be made, Lincoln will be defeated, as he ought to be for his total incapacity for his position and bad treatment of more competent persons.
My idea is that Gen. Butler would be entirely satisfactory to your party as well as the War Democrats and disaffected to Lincoln. Such a candidate, and one like him for Vice President, would wipe out Lincoln, and say to the South and Europe that we are in earnest. You would get great credit for such an arrangement, while accomplishing your purpose of favoring the country with a competent President, and shortening the war and its many evils.
There is a prestige connected with Gen. Butler's just decisions and prompt energetic course, that places him more prominently before the people than any other person.
I trust you will promptly answer this great question in the light of public good. I am very respectfully,
Your obedient servant, Edgar Conkling"
"July 23, 1864","Headquarters, Department Va. and N. C., FORT MONROE, July 23rd, 1864
Dear General: I have been thinking the matter over contained in Conkling's letter. I have always supposed that Fremont held himself in readiness to withdraw whenever he
could thereby aid any good man that was a candidate, and don't now think there will be trouble on that score.
I can think of no plan as feasible as the one Conkling mentions to bring you out. This has been a troublesome point to settle in my own mind. I now believe if the War Democracy will go to Chicago on the 9th of August (which I believe is [the date] of convention), and split off from balance of their party and nominate you on your own platform, that the way is clear. All other suggestions will settle themselves.
This appears to me the only safe way to get at the thing. And if you are sure that this can be done, it is better that Davis should not publish his protest against Lincoln until after the 9th of August, after you get the endorsement of War Democracy. Then have Davis come out with his paper, and have other leading Republicans come out and call a mass meeting at New York, or elsewhere, to endorse the action of War Democracy, and I think it will settle the matter. Of course everything depends on you holding your own with the public until you get out of the army. If you have no objections, I will go to Baltimore and have a chat with Davis. Seward has gone up, -- let me know what he is after.

I regret that I cannot visit you at Head Quarters this time. I will certainly do so in a few days. Mr. Fessenden has assigned to Mr. Mellen, Sup. Spec. Agent from the West, and me the preparation of regulations under the new law; we are engaged upon them, and well as I would like to confer with you regarding them it will not do for me to be absent so long.

Agt. to make local rules in the respective agencies, and under these we can shape matters as may be necessary to Virginia.
Mr. Fessenden is going home in a week to recruit, and desires to have regulations perfected before he goes.
You will observe by the law trade is to be limited to supplies to loyal people within our lines. Residents of insurrecting states are to be allowed to take or send their products to market and Govt. is to buy products through Treasury agents. All other commercial intercourse prohibited. Then the law provides for leasing lands, etc., and providing for the employment and general welfare of the freed persons.

Risley will not go up to see you now; he returns to Washington tomorrow night. They passed the day here. Will return in a week. He asked me if I had any word from you about coming down in the last few days. I told him, no, not any. He said Gen'l Smith came on the boat with him returning to his command. I do not like it. I am afraid you are to have trouble. Unless Grant is firm, Smith has won! Risley said, too, that Bates, if I have the name right, was moving against your military rule in Norfolk, and aiding Pierpont. I fear they do not mean you shall hold anywhere. Fisher read the article aloud you have sent to me on Sunday in the Tribune. We both admired it, and wonder if it were editorial. It is very ably written. And suits the time.

As it will be several days before the balance of the Nineteenth Corps will arrive, it will not be advisable to send any portion of it to Deep Bottom at present. Send none of it over until at least a complete division is here, and when that is sent over withdraw Foster, so as to hold your line at Bermuda Hundred perfectly safe.

I have relieved General Smith from command of the Eighteenth Corps, and shall place General Ord in his place. It is now open to select a commander for the Tenth Corps. Do you think of any major-general available who you would like to have? Birney and Gibbon are with the Army of the Potomac, only commanding divisions. General Ord will meet you today at the Eighteenth Corps headquarters.

General: I am obliged for the assignment of General Ord to the 18th Corps. In regard to the 10th, of the two Major Generals I believe Birney would be the best assignment. Allow me, however, to call your attention to General Martindale.
He is a graduate of the class of Gen. Meade, a gentleman of ability, and has shown himself to be a good soldier, a good lawyer, and you will pardon me for believing that he has some of the qualities therefore of a soldier. Gen. Martindale is the senior Brigadier General in the active service, and has been during the war in many battles, behaving well and without promotion. If you think with me, might not General Martindale be assigned to the 10th Corps? Of course, these are suggestions to your better judgment, only saying farther that General Martindale would be perfectly agreeable to me, and from what I have seen of him, commends himself to my good opinion. I say this without prejudice to General Birney, whom I also much respect. If it be said that General Martindale is only a Brigadier, that may be answered by saying that is not his fault, and I have no doubt he will earn his spurs.
Allow me to congratulate you upon the good news from Hunter. It is very good.

Dear Love: I feel so much relieved, Smith is ordered back to New York, and you to Fortress Monroe. Why would he enter into this quarrel? He has ability as a soldier, and the country needs such service. Gen'l Grant has, must have a deep personal grudge against him for his intriguing propensities, used no doubt at some time against himself, or he would not dismiss him so summarily. I think, too, that he likes and believes in you, and is too honorable himself to permit dishonorable action toward another when he has the power to prevent it. Trust to him, and use your best thoughts to serve him, for together you make the most able combination for effectual service to the country. The trouble with Smith is he wishes to be paramount; he would intrigue against anyone for the highest place, and therefore, though he might serve ably, he cannot serve truly.
You see, dearest, I forgot myself, in my eagerness for you -- that I cannot help when danger threatens you. When you are triumphant, I am foolish enough to think you forget me. Sometimes I know you love me. Do not forget me in triumph
or danger. I shall prove better worth remembering than any other ever can be, to you. How silly it is that I should write this to you. -- My mind runs along to curious quaint old things, ballads, and snatches of songs, such as ""spinsters and knitters in the sun, and the free maids that weave their thread with bones, do use to chant. It is silly sooth, and dallies with the innocence of love like the old time."" I have been out since I wrote thus far. Blanche came up after nine, and teased me into going out to bathe. To please her I went. They locked us out, and we were obliged to walk round to the carriage gate. It is nearly twelve o'clock. I am very weary. I have not sent you the letter I wrote of because I thought you might be in trouble, and feared to add to it.
Very affectionately yours, Sarah"

My dearest Sarah: I am keeping the mail waiting while I write a word. I rode over to Petersburg and the Potomac Army yesterday, and therefore am very lazy or tired this morning, so that I am just up. But if you are half as much disappointed and annoyed at not finding a letter as I am you will understand why I write even when I write nothing.
Smith is relieved and sent to New York. He will not be employed by Grant again in any important command. He has lost by his too great selfishness.
I don't know and do not care what they are about at Washington. If they want to quarrel, I am ready and ""Barkis is willin'."" I know I have done my duty in my command and my whole duty, and perhaps the sooner they break with me the better. They shall force me, not I them. I will not resign, and they shall find that I am uncomfortable to quarrel with. There, I must not gossip any more with you, for I haven't written a word I meant to say.
I do mean to say, my dearest, best love, that you must love me, bear with me -- trust me and be happy. You have no cause to do otherwise in truth and in fact. Do not grieve at all. There is no need. Every day convinces me that we must be all in all to each other, go on down hill hand in hand. My own wife, here is a kiss in memory of the roses, and as you read it they will come back again blushing brightly for a minute. I see them now, as girlish as at sixteen. I wish you could precisely

Dear General: I learn Shepley is intending to ask for twenty or thirty days' leave. Cannot you rig some excuse to put another man in his place? I am really out of patience with the workings of things there. The list of firms that Finegas speaks of as getting favors, own Shepley. They dine him and wine him and run him, put that to the disgraceful behavior of Weldon and his subordinates, and the fact that such cattle as Finegas and Hutchins, and their class who are persuading themselves as being under your special protection and patronage, hurt you more than you imagine. I admit that I can't exactly see the way out of this mess, but I will keep a thinking until I see some way. How would it do to ask Grant to recommend some of the wounded generals? Ransome commanded Natchez, I understand with credit to himself. He is unfit for active duty, and is a warm admirer of yours, and I know he is poor and has never made a cent while in the service, which is in his favor, as I have made up my mind that an officer to do his duty to you in such a place can't be on the make.
Shepley and all those around him are after making money. Now, if you could get Ransome and a good Provost Marshal, things would, I believe, improve. Ransome has, I think, plenty of ability. I wish you would consider this matter, and you might put Shepley off with something else. Say that Grant wanted Ransome provided for. Ransome stands very high with Grant.

Dearest: It is a wild night. The wind sweeps over the ramparts, carrying along mist and a soughing, sighing sound, melancholy and bodeful. The air is not cold, but heavy and oppressive. I rode out with Blanche half an hour ago, the sun as we rode up the beach was red as blood. You could look directly at the face, the beams were so obscured and veiled. I remember just such an appearance one summer day at home. Capt. George was with us at tea; the weather had been hot for weeks, the earth was baked and the grass withered. We strolled out down to the black birch tree by the road, and sat down there till quite dusk. We all remarked on the strange mysterious look that nature wore, threatening and volcanic. The summer had been very sickly. It was the season that Webster and the Nesmiths lost their children. George kept on talking (where in the world or out of it, does he talk now?) and speculating about Blanche and her future, what man would be likely to capture her, and all the advantages belonging. How much have they been increased since then? He, poor man, has observed and talked of her up to the time of his death, wondering what man would be fortunate enough to win what he had never seen combined before. Health, wealth,
and beauty! and good position. Poor George! we miss him sadly. You want him, now, in your political movements. Well, well, well, this gossip is as rambling as the old ""Muses to Juliet."" The breakers roll in splendidly tonight. Would you not be glad to let them dash over you? The phosphorescent creatures gleam in your face and shine on your fingers, and the crabs snap at your toes, as they did at Fisher's and Webster's, who came home bleeding -- laughed at by all. Oh love, you say you love me dearly, and I believe it fully, tonight. Are we on the down-hill road? Yes, I think so. I am. I do not care, if you do not worry me, and that I am sure you will not. I think I have no desire to try it over again -- nor will you by the time it is finished. What a poor, pitiful letter! Tomorrow I shall write of the freshest news, and speculate on the best means of ending the war with glory. And what poor wretches they are that have charge of it!

Dear Sir: On my return a few days since from Washington I should have been pleased to have visited you at your Head Quarters in the field, but the conviction that your time was wholly absorbed prevented.
Before leaving Washington I was much surprised to learn that you had received some erroneous impressions as to the conduct of our Local Treasury Agent at Roanoke Island. I learned that you had been informed that said Agent had acted somewhat recklessly in the issuing of permits for goods & supplies. In order to learn definitely, whether the allegations in this regard were well-founded, I called for some hours at Roanoke Island on my return to this place. A critical examination enables me to say to you that you certainly have been misinformed, & hence have labored under wrong impressions.
I find that the said Agent has not only exercised due caution & discretion in the issuing of permits, but that in no instance has he given authority to take goods away from the Island unless he had the written endorsement & sanction of Colonel Wardrope, the Military Commander.
From the fact that a seeming effort has been made for some purpose to shake your confidence in the integrity of the said Agent, I deem it the part of candor to give you the foregoing explanation. You may rest assured that the business of the Treasury Agency is conducted with proper care at the Island.
My earnest desire is for all local agents to act harmoniously with the military authorities, & to that end I am ever ready to exert whatever influence or power I may possess.
Since my return I have heard the evidence read in the case of the seizure of the steamer ""Philadelphia,"" & I regret, deeply, to say to you that there appears to have been not only a palpable violation of Treasury regulations, but of your own instructions & the specific conditions prescribed by General Shepley.
I may have occasion to address you again, soon, on matters of interest to the Government & this portion of your department. I am, General.

Dearest: Friday, a day of misfortunes! I tried to persuade Blanche to go to Norfolk with Mr. Webster to have a dress fitted. She could not be induced to go without me. I did not feel like it, and went reluctantly. The dress-maker was sick, and could not do the work. When we returned, three cards were on the table, Seward's, Frederick Seward and wife, Mrs. and Mr. Peale. They have passed the day here and I away! The very man of all others I wished to see! They might have asked me to go up with them. I know they would have liked me, because I wished them to. If I did not go with them, I might have shown them great attention here. They would have felt obliged. Grant is undoubtedly indebted to him for his place. If Seward has gone up to urge anything in regard to you, he will have great weight. If I had seen, I might have pleased and impressed him favorably, in spite of prejudice, if he feels it. It is a pity, but so it is. I shall never get near this man! The fates are against it. Better perhaps I should not. Carney will go up tomorrow. He has many things to tell you. I will leave that for him. I had a long talk with Shaffer the other day. Some things he says are very well. Others I do not like. Norfolk has some poor creatures in office that should be dismissed. But he said to me that every Massachusetts man had better be cleared out. This is bad and selfish advice. Are not the men from Mass. or N. England, which he also meant, as good as Col. Shaffer can bring from Illinois or the West? Keep the men whom you know to be honorable, capable business men, who are decent in their morals and conduct, and root out the others without mercy. For the rest I had rather you select your men than Shaffer should select them for you. Shaffer approves Webster, thinks him the only man of any account there is there. Weldon, I agree with him, never was fit for his place. He has a
set of hangers-on worse than himself. Shepley never could stand up -- in a moral view; that town, or, many of our people in it, are only fit for the wrath of Heaven. Select your own men as far as possible, but take them from the honorable, capable men you know. Then you need not stop your own operations to defend or punish these worthless people. Or be threatened with removal, as I hear you are, for their misconduct. Yes, I have been disappointed all day. And now I am weary and tired out with it. Your note of four lines was the last thing. Mine of four pages is worse yet. This is poor stuff I have written. I have written nothing I wish to say. I would see you, and see no way to do it. Adieu,

I am inclined to think that Foster's censure is a little too sweeping, although I can well pardon the vexation of an officer at the loss of what he so gallantly won.

My dearest Sarah: I am glad that unlucky Friday is over. Can you not see how your letters are so sad and mine so short? Your write me at night when wearied and harassed with the cares of the day -- just as you are going to bed -- at a time when you miss me most, I love to fancy, and then you feel lonely -- all is still except the sighing wind, and you give that wild imagination full play.
Mine, on the contrary, are so short because I sleep in the morning until Orderly says, ""Gen., anything for the mail?"" Then I have to jump up and write so short but then more joyous because mayhap I have just been dreaming of you. Now then, which is the best time to write? Both have their disadvantages, but after all mine is best, is it not?
I am about to make some radical changes in Norfolk which will meet many of your objections. I know of no Massachusetts men in Norfolk save Nichols and Farrington that I care for. Everybody else were appointed on Shaffer's recommendation. Be not annoyed about the man Casaran. Some of his statements are true and some false. I have had my eye on him for some time, and will, I reckon, take care of him. Stanton's spies do not alarm me, especially so shallow ones as Casaran. Seward came up here -- saw Grant in the morning, then came up at 1/2 past one o'clock to Point of Rocks in his boat, said he must go immediately down to avoid dangers of navigation. Grant came with him. He was very gracious and complimentary, and I have no doubt false. I could in no way learn what he came for. I do not believe he came for nothing. I think it was to find Grant's opinion of your humble servant. He goes back to see Shepley. I wonder what that is for. I would give a trifle is Shepley should get off before he comes down, or otherwise that Seward should be disappointed
in seeing him. However, it must go on as it is. There are many things now I could write if ""Gen., mail is ready,"" did not meet me, and so

Dearest: They have gone -- they have all passed by -- and left me a prey to disappointment. I can look at the delicious French soft-shelled crabs, spring chickens, green goose, nice, fresh baked cakes, cocoanut pies, stewed pears, ripe figs, fragrant coffee, iced wines, and the dish most inviting of all (that I came near forgetting), iced tomato salad. I shall look at all these, and sigh to think -- to what base uses they must now be given, instead of tickling the appetite of a Cabinet Minister, that is as ticklish to suit as the big speckled trout that quietly floats among the mosses and ferns under the shadow of rock and alder bushes. The minnows snap at anything -- the trout bides his time, waits for the gilded fly, fashioned to tickle his fancy -- and is caught, like the rest. I should be glad now -- I am so vexed, if this one were caught with a ""salt fish tied to his hook, which he with fervency drew up."" Intended for a Cabinet Minister, shall this goodly lunch be pressed and crushed with the ivories of the smiling darkies that prepared it? Forbid it, Epicurus! to such poor uses it must not be given! They will have all our good things by degrees, when they are able to bear them, not just yet. I send out immediately for Col. Shaffer, and the ladies who have not as yet feasted on crabs. The Secretary went into Norfolk last night at nine, spent the night with Shepley, and passed here this morning, with an apology that he had no more time, as the European mail goes out tomorrow. Shepley did not go up with him, but he had ample time for conversation at his house. And he is so slippery you will never know what he said. He was over this afternoon, but did not call on me or Shaffer, as is his custom. I think it would be a dangerous interview for a man like Shepley. Resembling each other in their adroit intrigues and social proclivities, the one is so superior to the other in point of skill, he could squeeze him like a sponge without his feeling the pressure. Or if aware of it, willing, from his nature, which is somewhat treacherous, to be squeezed if by yielding he could see a possiblity of advantage to himself.
Well, the fates are against me in this. I had a fancy if I
could see these people pleasantly, and Seward had an ugly thing to do against you, I might possibly avert it. We must let things take their course, perhaps they are better that way than when we try to direct them. You cannot call this letter sad, dearest. I was obliged to leave it last night just there.

Fellow Citizens: The undersigned, after personal consultation and extensive correspondence with a number of the leading democrats in the loyal States, have concluded to call a National mass convention of the War Democrats of the United States to meet at Cooper Institute, in the City of New York,
on Thursday, August 17th, at 12 o'clock, noon, for the purpose of consultation and organization preparatory to the Presidential canvass.
We cordially invite all democrats who are resolved to maintain at all hazards and in every contingency the integrity of the nation, whose supreme law is the Constitution; all who are for a vigorous prosecution of the war, with a view to its speedy termination by the accumulation of overwhelming forces on decisive points, supported by adequate reserves, and proper precautions to avert the annual invasions which for three years have endangered the national capitol and desolated the loyal States bordering on the rebellion; all who are for converting the negro population from laborers for the support of rebels into soldiers for the relief of loyal white men; all who are in favor of confining the discretionary power of arrest without judicial process to cases involving grave public danger, for which alone it was intended, and discountenancing its perversion to the purpose of a substitute for the ordinary criminal law of the land, anti-republican in spirit and dangerous in precedent; all who are in favor of electing a man for President who will consult and take the advice of his cabinet, and of a Cabinet which will not permit great measures to be resolved upon and executed by the President on which they have not been consulted, and which they disapprove; all who are unwilling to see the existing bureaucracy become the permanent system of the government, whereby it will be deprived of the benefit of responsible Cabinet ministers; all who are willing to recognize the undeniable fact that Slavery as an institution is practically destroyed, and who are therefore ready to demand an amendment to the National Constitution which shall declare that fact, and forever prohibit its re-establishment in any State or Territory of the Union; all who believe that as a free people our greatest safeguard from Executive usurpation and eventual despotism will be found in a firm adherence to the One Term principle; all who are for the enforcement of the Monroe doctrine by the entire military power of the Nation, and for a National administration that in its foreign policy, in the language of Jackson, ""will ask for nothing that is not right and submit to nothing that is wrong,"" and who are for ""a plain and simple government, devoid of pomp, protecting all and granting special favors to none."" All these are earnestly invited to meet with us at the time and place above named for the purpose designated.
 -- 536  -- We are impelled to this course by no spirit of faction. To go into a National Convention the delegates to which have been all appointed months in advance by packed conventions, and pledge ourselves to abide its action and support the candidates nominated, would be simply to surrender unconditionally to the dictation of the faction who have assumed to speak for the Democratic party of the United States.
The loyal democracy of this country do not recognize the authority of the present self-constituted Executive committee to call a National convention of the democracy of the United States to meet at Chicago.
We cannot recognize the action of the Chicago convention as binding on us, because we have had no voice in calling it, nor in the selection of delegates already chosen to it.
Before the question of the Presidency had been discussed, or the so-called democratic National Convention to meet at Chicago had been called, and while all true democrats were either in the army fighting to put down the rebellion, or laboring some day and night to fill up the army, a combination of self-appointed leaders, aided by the machinery of a secret political organization, constituted themselves into what they are pleased to called a National Democratic Executive Committee, and actively engaged in having State Conventions held six and eight months before the time designated for the meeting of the Chicago convention.
The State Conventions already held have thus far been chiefly called and controlled through the agency of these self-constituted leaders, to the practical exclusion of all loyal democrats, especially those in the army, so that a large majority of the delegates elected to the Convention to meet at Chicago are known to be hostile to the time-honored principles of the democratic party, and many are openly in sympathy with the rebellion.
The War Democrats, both at home and in the army, ask for a fair hearing, and for a National Convention that shall honestly represent the loyal democracy of the U. S.
On this movement, sincerely believed by us to be for the best interest of the country, and necessary to secure union and harmony among the loyal democrats of the Nation, we ask the earnest co-operation of all loyal men, and invoke the gracious favor of Almighty God."

Maj. Gen. G. G. Meade, Comd'g Army of the Potomac
General: Before making an expedition down the Weldon, road, I propose to make a demonstration on the north side of the James River, having for its real object the destruction of the railroads on that side. To execute this, the 2nd Army Corps, two Divisions of Sheridan's Cavalry, Sheridan commanding in person, will be required. Kautz' Cavalry will also be ordered to report to Sheridan for the occasion. This whole force should be got to Deep Bottom, without attracting the attention of the enemy, and before our own people are allowed a clue to what is really intended. There are now two pontoon bridges at Deep Bottom, and in the evening before the movement commences a second should be thrown across the Appomattox at Broadway. This would give two roadways the whole distance to be travelled. There are now two bridges at Deep Bottom and on the New Market and Malvern Hill road. These troops will continue to hold their present position, thus securing the crossing for our troops on their return. After crossing James River, the Cavalry will advance as rapidly as possible on to the Va. Central Railroad -- in fact the bridges over the Chickahominy on both roads should be destroyed -- as near to the city as possible. From this point they will work north as far as the South Anna, unless driven off sooner. I will direct Gen. Ingalls to send with the expedition two hundred of his railroad men to aid in the work of destruction.
The 2nd Corps will also advance as rapidly as possible from Deep Bottom until they get opposite Chapins Bluff. Here they will take up a line to prevent the enemy throwing a force across the river to cut off the return of our cavalry. If in the judgment of the Comd'g Officer his whole force is not necessary for this, he will advance towards Richmond with his available force, and hold such positions as he may think will insure the greatest security to the expedition.
No wagons will be taken with the expedition, except to carry necessary intrenching tools and tools for destroying roads. Wagons, however, to carry forty rounds of ammunition and five days' rations and three days' grain, may be sent in advance and packed near the pontoon bridge over the James, ready to be forwarded if required. The troops will carry four days rations with them, commencing from the time they leave
Deep Bottom. To give them these, the Commissary at Deep Bottom will be instructed to have on hand sixty thousand rations ready to issue.
When the work of destroying the railroads is accomplished, the whole expedition will return and resume their present places.
It is barely possible that by a bold move this expedition may surprise the little garrison of citizen soldiery now in Richmond, and get in. This cannot be done, however, by any cautious movement, developing our force and making reconnoissances before attacking. The only way in which it can be done at all is to ride up to the city boldly, dismount, and go in at the first point reached. If carried in this way the prize could be secured by hurrying up the 2d Corps, and sending back word here so that other disposition be made.
This expedition has for its object as first stated to destroy the railroads north of Richmond. If anything more favorable grows out of it, it will be due to the officers and men composing [it], and will be duly appreciated.
In the absence of the 2d Corps and Cavalry, great watchfulness will be required on the part of the other troops, and readiness to take advantage of any movement of the enemy.
In preparing for this move let it be understood that it is for a grand raid towards Weldon. I do not mean to imply the necessity of saying anything untrue, but simply to make the necessary preparations for starting without giving out the idea of what is to be done, and leave our troops to guess that it is to go South, as they will, without contradiction.
I should like this expedition to get off tomorrow night if possible; if not, then the night following. I am,
Very respectfully Yours, U. S. Grant, Lt. Genl."

I have just examined some prisoners and deserters. There are opposite Deep Bottom, Johnson's Brigade of Beauregard's forces, McGowan's Brigade (now Conner's), and Lane's Brigade. These Brigades will average about nine hundred (900) men. On last Saturday McGowan's Division of Longstreet's Corps came there, consisting of Kershaw's old Brigade, Kershaw now commanding the Division, Humphrey's Brigade, about seven hundred (700) men, Wafford's Brigade, about eight hundred (800), Bryan's Brigade about (800), Kershaw's Brigade, about eight hundred (800). They are entrenching themselves in front of Foster between three (3) and four (4) mile creek. I cannot learn that they extend to our right beyond four (4) mile creek. It is reported, but this is not certain, that A. P. Hill has relieved Kershaw, and is in command of all the troops on the north of the James.
A refugee who left Richmond on Saturday reports no troops in Richmond save the second class militia, that is under eighteen and above forty-five, & the foreign legion of five (5) or six hundred (600), guarding prisoners & bridges. This is also confirmed by two (2) other refuges that left Richmond yesterday.

To Maj. Gen. B. F. Butler, Comdg.
General: The result of submitting to the people of Norfolk the question of the continuance of municipal Govt. was that on yesterday three hundred and thirty (330) voted against ""continuing the present form of municipal government during the existence of military occupation,"" and sixteen (16) only in favor of its continuance. One hundred and nine (109) persons only, voted for Mayor.
If the act of voting for municipal officers is to be considered as an expression in favor of the continuance of municipal government, then less than one fourth (1/4) of the voters desire its continuance; but many persons voted for Mayor who voted ""No"" on the question submitted. There is no pretence but this is a fair expression of the preferences of the citizens of Norfolk.
My order only allowed those to vote upon the question who were entitled to vote by the Laws of Virginia, thus in effect adopting the precise direction laid down in the President's Amnesty Proclamation.
I submit, therefore, for your determination, the question of the further continuance of these officers, with the suggestions that you should issue such orders, or direct me to issue such orders as may be required before the 1st day of Aug., as that is the time for the commencement of the new administration.

We are utterly distressed and disgusted with the candidate for the Presidency. Political tricksters and fanatics have one ticket, pap-fed parasites, contractors, and office holders another, and the peace men and traitors will soon have a third. What are we to do?
No man who follows the advice of Wm. H. Seward, who consults with that arch rascal, prince of legislative corruptionists, and bosom friend of the Secretary of State, who lends himself to these men and innocently (?) commits such damnable blunders as Mr. Lincoln has, can expect the votes of men who see the need of a vigorous ruler, of one who is not afraid to hurt rebels, who so hates treason that he will hang traitors, confiscate their property, do justice to loyal men, and retaliate the wrongs even of negroes.
We are like raftsmen whose raft had gone to pieces -- broken up -- left struggling each on separate planks, which planks if put together would make a grand platform of pure politics, human rights, vigorous war, forgiveness to rebels who prove themselves worthy, National rights on sea and land, and
personal rights everywhere. There is one man in sight -- whose beck can congregate these raftsmen all afloat -- whose magic can inspire them to put together the platform, and whose pure patriotism will be their cynosure.

Although a large number of them did not come into our possession actually, they had been surrendered to us and must be looked upon as prisoners of war, as much so as were the officers and crew of the U.

They are so few that until I received your despatch I was under the impression that these roads were most excellent. I have the statement of Captain Gordon and four other officers of the cavalry staff, who rode over the roads the day before the movement, that the roads were very good. I would ask you to send an officer over the road to report. I will have it carefully cleaned up if anything is found.

Allow me to submit to your consideration a thought which has struck me. The rebels have fortified Howlett House Bluff with 19 guns, and a very strong work. Trents Reach is so shallow that our iron-clads cannot get up without great labor in dredging the channels. Now what hinders us from turning the Howlett House Battery by taking the hint from that Dutchman and cut a canal at Dutch Gap?
It is but 200 yards from 16 ft. water to 16 ft. water across the gap. The land is but 30 feet high as an average, and we should have for a fifty feet cut but about 55,000 cubic feet of excavation or 10 days' labor for a thousand men. By that means one iron-clad could get out and Howlett would be useless. If you will look upon the map you will get my idea at once.
I have made my examination by the coast survey map. I should not depend on the current to do any part of the cutting, as at Vicksburg, although it might help. The gunboats cover the place.
Respectfully, Benj. F. Butler, Maj. Gen. Commdg."

Pardon me if I am presuming too much to address these few lines to you, but I would make an appeal to you, most respected of commanders, in behalf of those brave defenders of the Union now suffering such wretched misery, and wasting slowly away in southern confines, under the inhuman treatment of their captors. I read in the Journal that in your department you are again agitating the question of exchange, and we women of the north would implore you to accept the terms of the rebel commissioner, Col. Ould.
It may seem a disadvantage to exchange otherwise than ""man for man,"" but if all these suffering ones were liberated, would it not inspire our whole army with fresh courage, cause them to feel that they were fighting for a government that respected their rights, and would protect them in the hour of trial, even as they had periled their lives in her defence, and feeling thus would they not fight on with renewed patriotism and love of country?
At home, too, the call of the President for ""five hundred thousand more"" would meet with a heartier response if men could feel that humanity and justice was the watchword of our rulers.
I enclose a piece clipped from the evening Journal which has roused our sympathies for the oppressed, and -- I almost said our indignation at a government that has so long permitted her heroic defenders to endure this torture. Can the nation expect prosperity and the blessing of the All-pitiful-Father if
such is its policy? Rather may we expect a curse than a blessing.
It seems but little that woman can do in this monster struggle, but her influence has done much to fill the ranks of our armies, to encourage the faltering and urge on the noble ones who could go to suffer and die if need be, for freedom's sake, but how can she, after reading such accounts as the one referred to, encourage her friends to volunteer? Only yesterday I heard the mother of a son, patriotically inclined, assert her determination to do everything in her power to keep him from the army, and yet each woman earnestly desires success for our arms; but the mother's heart shrinks from exposing her son to the possibilities of such a fate as here portrayed. There is nothing so discourages enlisting as the fact of the government allowing her men to endure the barbarous treatment.
Noble Commander, hear our prayer, let the oppressed go free, and the blessings of the wives, mothers, sisters, and sweet-hearts of twenty thousand Union prisoners shall follow you all the days of your life.
Respectfully yours in behalf of our suffering ones.

Dearest: We are back at the Fort. Dr. McCormick, Kensel, and Weitzel came with us to dinner or tea. Now you can imagine how tired I am. I think so many times about your being ill this morning. You are better by this time, I know. And you have great strength still in reserve. I do not feel as though I had a particle. I know you had very little pleasure in my visit. I was so weary with the constant feeling that I should get worse and unable to get back. Indeed, I can hardly sit at the table and hold the pen. But I want to write you something about Seward, that has fairly worked through my mind today. He expected to find you at the Fortress. All that he said confirms it. And he came prepared to offer you certain things on condition. When he found that Grant had sustained you, it interfered with his plans. You were less come-at-able than if you had been in disgrace at the Fortress. And terms more difficult to make. He must be wrathful with Grant for interfering. It was not Hancock he wanted, but you, though he may take the other. But the
other in that position does not avail much to the success of the Administration. You, if rightfully guarded, would be of infinite service. And the offer may yet be made you, but it does not stand as Seward wished it. And if victory can be gained -- or any other available opening, to win the public he will not make it. I am very sorry I did not see him. I am so fatigued I do not know as I write clearly but I think you will understand me. To me all his movements now look clear as day. I wonder what you are thinking of at this hour? Kindly of me I hope, as I think earnestly of you. Indeed, you will never have reason to think otherwise of me though I trouble you a little at times.

Maj. Gen. B. F. Butler, Comd'g Dept. of Va. & N. C.
General: The main object of the expedition north of the James River having failed by reason of the very large force thrown there by the enemy, I have determined to try and take advantage of the division made by assaulting at Petersburg before the enemy can get much of his force back there. As the assault must be made promptly on the return of our troops, and a night march being necessary to deceive the enemy, which will necessarily fatigue the troops to such an extent as to make their attack weak, I determined to withdraw one Division of the 2d Corps during last night, and with it relieve the 18th Corps, so as to have all fresh troops for the first assault.
The Division which withdrew last night marched to the neighborhood of Petersburg. They will rest today, and under cover of night take the place of the 18th Corps. Gen. Meade having studied all the ground over which the assault is to be made, and the 9th Corps & part of his command having the advance in the assault, Gen. Ord will report to Gen. Meade for instructions during the assault. Gen. Meade has received verbal instructions from me, and is now industriously engaged preparing the detail.
As soon as it is dark, Gen. Hancock will commence the withdrawal of the balance of his corps. The cavalry will follow the inf. The former will reach Petersburg with all dispatch, and follow the assaulting column, or take the place now occupied by the 18th Corps as may be found advisable. The cavalry will make a forced march to the left of our present line, and be in readiness to move round the enemy's right.
This movement will leave the garrison at Deep Bottom in
presence of vastly superior forces. The Navy will want to dispose of their vessels in such manner as to sweep all the ground in front of our troops. I wish you would communicate with Capt. Smith, through a staff officer, on this subject. Please caution him to make no changes through the day calculated to attract special interest on the part of the enemy.
Gen. Foster, I think, had better level the line of rifle pits we captured from the enemy, and move his whole force to the side of the creek first occupied by him. The lower pontoon bridge should also be swing around to the left bank of the river. It may be advisable for Gen. Foster to move his teams and surplus property to the left bank, but these details I leave to you.
If possible, I want to leave our withdrawal from the north bank of the river concealed from the enemy until the attack commences at Petersburg. I have had Gen. Ord informed, verbally, of the fact that he is to be relieved by the 2d Corps and is to form a part of the assaulting column. It only remains to notify him that during the assault he will receive orders from Gen. Meade. Very Respectfully,
Your obt. svt., U. S. Grant, Lt. Gen."
"July 29, 1864","July 29th, 1864
Your instructions are quite clear, and perhaps I ought not to trouble you, but fearing that I may misunderstand, I venture to ask a word of explanation.
You say, ""Gen. Foster had better level the line of rifle pits occupied by the enemy, and move his whole force to the side of the creek first occupied by him."" Gen. Foster originally held two positions defended by works, one on the north side & one on the south side of the creek, the latter being held to prevent the enemy from commanding the former, with that position.
If Foster abandons the south side, and places his whole force on the north side, he will be overlooked by the enemy. By leaving a small force in the south work, I think he can defend both positions better than one.
We will leave some pontoon boats or the bridge, as the enemy cannot cross in face of the gunboats. Is it your intention that we should literally obey the order, or merely that Foster shall hold his old position if he can? If the latter, it may be telegraphed ""hold the old position,"" if the former, ""obey instructions.""

The following instructions are issued for the guidance of all concerned.
1st. As soon as it is dark, Major Gen'l. Burnside, Comd'g. 9th Corps, will withdraw his two brigades under Genl. White, occupying the entrenchments between the plank and Norfolk roads, and bring them to his front. Care will be taken not to interfere with the troops of the 18th Corps moving into their position in rear of the 9th Corps. Gen'l. Burnside will form his troops for assaulting the enemy's works at daylight of the 30th, prepare his parapets, and leave the pioneers equipped for work in opening passages for artillery, destroying enemy's abatis, &c., and the entrenching tools distributed for effecting lodgments, &c.
2nd. Maj. Gen'l. Warren, Comd'g 5th Corps, will reduce the number of his troops holding the entrenchments of his front to the minimum, and concentrate all his available force on his right, and hold them prepared to support the assault of Maj. Gen'l. Burnside. The preparations in respect to pioneers, entrenching tools, &c., enjoined upon the 9th Corps, will also be made by the 5th Corps.
3rd. As soon as it is dark, Maj. Gen. Ord, Com'd'g 18th Corps, will relieve his troops in the trenches by Gen. Mott's Division of the 2nd Corps, and form his Corps in rear of the 9th Corps, and be prepared to support the assault of Maj. Genl. Burnside.
4th. Every preparation will be made for moving forward the field artillery of each Corps.
5th. At dark, Maj. Gen'l. Hancock, Comd'g 2nd Corps, will move from Deep Bottom to the rear of the entrenchments now held by the 18th Corps, resume the command of Mott's Division, and be prepared at daylight to follow up the assaulting and supporting columns, or for such other operations as may be found necessary.
6th. Maj. Gen'l. Sheridan, Comd'g Cavalry Corps, will proceed at dark from the vicinity of Deep Bottom to Lee's Mill, and at day-light will move with his whole Corps, including Wilson's Division, against the enemy's troops defending Petersburg on their right, by the roads leading to that town from the Southward and Westward.
 -- 559  -- 7th. Major Duane, Act'g Chief Engineer, will have the pontoon trains packed at convenient points in the rear prepared to move. He will see that supplies of sand bags, gabions, fascines, &c. are in the depot near the lines ready for use. He will detail engineer officers for each Corps.
8th. At half past three in the morning of the 30th, Maj. Gen'l. Burnside will spring his mine, and his assaulting columns will immediately move rapidly upon the breach, seize the crest in the rear, and effect a lodgment there. He will be followed by Maj. Gen. Ord, who will support him on the right, directing his movement to the crest indicated, and by Maj. Gen. Warren, who will support him on the left.
Upon the explosion of the mine, the artillery of all kinds in battery will open upon those points of the enemy's works whose fire covers the ground over which our columns must move, care being taken to avoid impeding the progress of our troops. Special instructions respecting the direction of fire will be issued through the Chief of Artillery.
9th. Corps Commanders will report to the Comd'g Genl. when their preparations are complete, and will advise him of every step in the progress of the operation, and of everything important that occurs.
10th. Promptitude, rapidity of execution, and cordial coöperation are essential to success, and the Comd'g Genl. is confident that this indication of his expectations will insure the hearty efforts of the Commanders and troops.
11th. Head Quarters during the operation will be at the Head Quarters of the 9th Corps.

Dear Sir: As you have already learned, Gen. Hancock has been ordered to move in another direction, -- this will leave a vastly superior force in your front, which probably will attempt to assault your works and to carry them by superior numbers. In a military sense the worth of a post is only what it may cost the enemy to take it, as it is axiomatic, that all posts and garrison places may be taken at some cost. Now then, you will have if the rebels attack you a gallant defence.
Make it cost them all your post is worth. A good defence even with loss is better than an attempted retreat. Surrender I know you never will. Nay more, you will lose less men in a defence however protracted and deadly than you will in a retreat.
If they do attack you, every moment you hold out costs them hours on the left, and aids Gen. Grant's movement in the most essential manner.
You can and will hold them, and for your courage and conduct I shall be most happy to bear the fullest testimony.

The last news I have heard from Sherman brought his operations down to Friday night, at which time all moved well.

My dearest little Wife: I get two letters and you get none last night. That is too bad. But then you had the President and General Grant. Was not that enough?
We made the assault upon Petersburg, and decidedly and totally failed with a loss of some three or four thousand men. All from the incompetency or worse of the generals. As Turner expressed it, too many men, too few generals. In the advance lines, after they were taken by our troops, from which we were afterwards driven, there was not a single division commander, and the supporting column was 3/4 of an hour behind. We shall never get on at this rate. The plan was a good one -- there were men more than enough there, but what has happened in every case happened here -- want of moving in time and in concert.
Now all the 19th Corps are ordered to Washington, and I do not know how many more will go. I do not see the use of Grant's planning movements and battles, and his plans are admirable, when nobody will execute them.
Have you any idea what the President came down for? Weitzel is no better, and goes down to Fortress Monroe to encamp near the sea for a few days, to see if that will aid his health. He will not come into the house as I asked him over and over again to do.
They have laid a trap for me at Washington, to see if I cannot be caught on the Civil Government at Norfolk. Upon consultation of Washington Judge Snead has advertised to open his court today in Norfolk. I have sent for him, and he admits that this is done to make a case against me, and upon inquiry
says that it is to be opened in opposition to the military orders of the Government. This put him in my hands of course, he cannot open his court in opposition to the military in a camp. I have arrested him, and shall hold him in spite of the Government's Attorney General. So you see we go. I will go home on the question before I will yield.

The President of the United States
Sir: As you are aware, the city of Norfolk was captured from the Rebels in March, 1862, I believe you were present at the capture, -- the most disloyal city probably in Virginia not excepting Richmond. By the Comdg. General of this department, it has been garrisoned by troops of the Unites States ever since martial law was proclaimed, and since that time Norfolk has been a depot for troops and provisions for the United States army, of great value and extent because of its geographical situation. It was excepted from the proclamation on account of its disloyalty which opened trade to Beaufort, Port Royal, and New Orleans, although captured previously to the last two.
When I took command of this department through your kind consideration in November last, I found nineteen-twentieths (19/20ths) of the citizens of Norfolk disloyal, and more than one-half actually and actively engaged in correspondence with and giving aid to the enemy. Few had taken the oath of allegiance to the United States, and fewer still
who had taken it respected it as a binding obligation. I found the streets and wharves out of repair, filthy and dangerous. I found its Fire Department utterly disorganized and inefficient both in men and material, so much so that only a few days before I took command a large fire, destroying a very great amount of private property and some public, and endangering still more, had occurred, which was the work of an incendiary. I found the government distributing provisions to the white inhabitants alone to the amount of some seventy-five thousand dollars ($75,000) yearly. The churches with a single exception were unopened because those who should have taught the religion of Christ would only teach rebellion. I found that the people were governed by an admixture of military government and civil government, neither of which was administered with too much vigor. As an instance of the administration of the military government, I found an order had been promulgated with a view of increasing the respect of the people for the flag of the United States, and make them pass under the same, that that flag should be hoisted over all the grog ships and drinking saloons where the people most did congregate, so that a large part of the citizens thereby were brought under the influence of the stars and stripes.
As an instance of the efficiency of the civil government, the city government attempted to discharge the city watch for inefficiency, but the watchmen claimed that being elected for a year their office was in the nature of a contract, and they had a right to serve a year, and could not be discharged. This claim was sustained by the corporation court, and the city had to pay the wages of the watchmen without any services.
I also found that the city government had been inaugurated by a vote of about one hundred (100) of the citizens, over forty (40) of whom enjoy the offices to which the one hundred (100) votes elect them. I also found that in the portion of Virginia occupied by garrisons as military posts of the United States -- to wit, Alexandria, the Eastern shore, the peninsula formed between the Chesapeake Bay and the Atlantic, and the cities of Norfolk and Portsmouth -- had enacted themselves into the state of Virginia, had formed a supposed government, had undertaken to legislate for all the good people of Virginia, had imposed laws, had elected a majority of themselves to office, had claimed to send senators to the United States Senate, which in my judgment in an evil hour permitted them to take seats, an experiment which the subsequent conduct of the
Senate shows will not be repeated. Members of Congress representing nobody had been elected and refused their seats, and so far as I could see the only action of the restored government was to tax people in the shape of imposts and licenses principally upon the sale of liquor, which was sanctioned by raising the United States flag over the place where such liquors were mixed and drank. It had attempted legislation which should show how near it could be loyal without separating itself from disloyalty.
Believing that the President of the United States and the commander in chief of the army did not desire such military administration, I set myself to work to reform it according as I could guess the policy of the government. I ordered the city to be cleaned, so that pestilence might be warded off -- the wharves to be repaired, the fire department to be reorganized so that the public property was rendered safe, -- that a night patrol and watch should be set, so as to protect the city from incendiaries, -- that the streets should be lighted to prevent burglary and crime, -- that the poor should be fed at an expense less than one-half that with which it had formerly been done, -- that the negroes who had swarmed into the city and by herding together formed fruitful sources of vice and disease, should be sent out on the farms and adjacent lands.
I also caused the oath prescribed by the President of the United States to be administered to all who had been in rebellion, and proposed to do any business or take part in any governmental action or receive anything from the government but personal protectio. I caused everybody who did any thing disloyal to be arrested, and either punished or sent away.
I did not interfere with the workings of the civil government because that government did nothing but to draw the salaries, and the members thereof nothing but quarrel among themselves, and I was quite willing that the people should try thoroughly the experiment they had set on foot and settle for themselves the government under which they wished to live, as they had already settled the institutions under which they would live by a portion going into the Confederate lines and a portion remaining under the protection of the United States.
On the 24th day of June last past, that city government was about to expire by its own limitation, and an election was ordered under some supposed authority to be had on that day. In the meantime a very large number of the most respectable, most loyal, and reliable citizens of Norfolk had asked the
Comdg. General to examine into and develop the workings of the civil government. Thereupon reports were called for, from all the civil officers, the results of which I have already had the honor to report to you, but perhaps it may not be inappropriate to restate one or two of those results here -- and one, the principal one was that out of the revenues of the city, amounting to some thirteen thousand dollars ($13,000), only one hundred and fifty dollars ($150) had been collected by legitimate. taxation within the previous six months, the rest being imposts upon trade and business during that period, and of that thirteen thousand dollars ($13,000) twelve thousand ($12,000) had been expended in salaries.
When these exhibits were published, was it to be doubted that those good citizens desired a government which should be efficient as well for protection as taxation, and a chance as well to earn as to receive salaries should be offered them?
Therefore it was that a large majority of those citizens asked the Comdg. Gen'l. of the department to provide for them a remedy, knowing that the City of Norfolk was but a military post, dependent upon its garrison for its safety as well as for means of subsistence of its people, under the blockade of the fleet, and not an open port. It seemed to be an appropriate place for the exercise of martial law, being a camp only, in which, as I have before observed, martial law had been declared.
Now, my theory of the law martial is this -- that it is a well-known, well-settled, and well-defined part of the common law of this country, received by us from England and recognized in its proper place by the Constitution, and that proper place, leaving out all disputed questions, is in the camp and garrison. Now, the best definition of martial law that I have ever heard was that by Sir Arthur Wellesly, afterwards Duke of Wellington, while serving in Spain: ""The will of the Comdg. General exercised according to the principles of natural equity.""
If this be so, or under any other definition which can be given by any writer on public law, then all civil rights and governments in camp and garrison where martial law obtains must be subservient to it, and therefore permissive only. Thus civil government may well exist in subordination to martial law controlling, restraining and protecting citizens, when it is so constituted that the government is efficient to the end desired. When it cannot do that, that government is, like any other useless thing, to be cast aside.
From such examination as I was able to make I had come
fully to the conclusion that the government, commonly called the restored government of Virginia, and specially so much of it as was within the camp of the United States troops at Norfolk, was that useless, expensive, and inefficient thing, unrecognized by Congress, unknown to the Constitution of the United States, and of such character that there is no command in the Decalogue against worshiping it, it being the likeness of nothing in the Heavens above, the earth beneath, or the waters under the earth.
But fearing lest three (3) years' life in camp, and in the exercise of military power might have blunted a judgment educated in the administration of civil law, I preferred not to trust my own judgment to decide peremptorily what should be done with that civil government, and therefore I directed the commandant at Norfolk at the then coming election to ask the loyal citizens duly qualified to vote to express their opinions upon the question, whether the civil government as administered was desirable during the occupation of Norfolk as a military post. I was specially induced to take this course and take the judgment of the people because one Pierpont, claiming to be Governor of Virginia, had made certain allegations against and observations upon the administration of the law partial by the military commanders of this Department, which tended to show that military rule was conducted with oppression, fraud, and wrong upon the citizens of Norfolk. Of course, if these allegations were true, the good people of Norfolk would know the fact quite as well as would Mr. Pierpont, who spends most of his time in Washington and Alexandria. The orders calling for that expression of opinion and its results are recited in my order of June 30th, which I beg leave to append as part of this report. With the singular unanimity of three hundred and thirty (330) to sixteen (16), the qualified voters of Norfolk by any laws that ever existed in Virginia decided against the further existence of civil government. On the same day election was held for city officers, and while upon the question of civil government, three hundred and forty-six (346) voted, upon the election of Mayor but one hundred and nine (109) voted, fifty-two (52) of whom voted for one candidate and fifty-seven (57) for another. Now, the tickets of the various city officers, of which there were two, contained forty-five (45) officers depending upon the election of either ticket -- assuming that these ninety (90) men voted for each other it would leave but nineteen (19) other voters
who take any interest in the question of their ruler. This result, at once so gratifying and convincing, determined the General Comd'g. the Department upon the course which he ought to pursue. Therefore the order of June 30th, 1864, was issued, staying the exercise of civil government in the city of Norfolk as long as she should be a camp and garrison of United States troops, and providing for the safety of the city. That order and the action of the Comdg. General was received by the same singular unanimity and acquiescence by the citizens; quiet, peace, harmony, and good order are observed in the city of Norfolk to as much effect as in any city of the United States, and everything remained calmly quiet from said 30th day of June to the 30th day of July, as far as known to the Comdg. General.
On that 30th day of July a communication from a public meeting of the citizens of Norfolk brought it to the attention of the Comdg. General that Edward K. Snead, who never before the rebellion had been a citizen of Norfolk, and who by his own confession remained on the eastern shore while it was in rebellion against the United States, practicing his profession as a lawyer under the Confederate government, and serving in its militia, had removed to Norfolk for the purpose of being elected Judge of the First Judicial District of Virginia, which includes the very large territory comprised in the counties of Norfolk, Princess Anne, Isle of Wight, Southampton, Surrey, and Sussex -- all of which was then in the rebel lines except Norfolk, and had been so elected; that one Baker is now exercising the functions of Judge of said Judicial circuit under a commission given by him the Governor of the State of Virginia long before the rebellion. Indeed, if we look to regularity of appointment for ""apostolic succession"" it is very clear if the State of Virginia has never gone out of the Union Judge Baker is still the legitimate Judge of that circuit. He has received no new commission, and he had nine-tenths (9/10) of the entire judicial circuit within the limits of his judicial jurisdiction. I further learned that Mr. Snead claimed that he was elected to this large Judicial Circuit by the vote of Norfolk and Portsmouth, in one of which, a city of twelve thousand (12,000) inhabitants, seventy (70) votes were cast for him, in the other one hundred (100). After he was elected, he took the oath of allegiance to the United States and became thereby a loyal citizen of the restored government of Virginia.
It was also brought to my attention that he was about to
hold a Judicial Court as such Judge in the City of Norfolk. Now, if that Court could have been held in subordination to the military authorities and in their aid, no one would have rejoiced more at such efficient assistance than the Comdg. General. But it was brought to the attention of the Comdg. General by this meeting that it was not the intention to hold this Court in aid of the military authorities, either in governing the people, five-eighths of whom at least were disloyal, or in the suppression of the rebellion, but that the Court was to be held for the purpose of embarrassing the military government and inaugurating a conflict between the civil and military authority of the United States like that which disgraced the city and state of New York in the summer of 1863.
In tender regard for civil rights everywhere, for the purpose of avoiding all possible conflict even in camp between any supposed civil authorities and military authorities, to the end that to every extent where it was possible and practicable the military should be subordinate to civil power, I caused said Snead to be brought to my Head Quarters, and enquired among other things whether his court was to hold in subordination or opposition to the military authorities, with a frankness which does him credit, and is a good example to others engaged in this transaction as I shall narrate hereafter, he averred it was his intention to hold his court in opposition to the military authorities of the United States. I thereupon informed him that nothing could be done in this Department while the rebellion remained unsuppressed, especially in the camps and garrisons of this Department, in opposition to this authority, and therefore it would become necessary to stay him and hold him quiet from all such operations. But believing that he was but an instrument in the hands of others, and charmed with his frankness, I offered not to interfere with him personally if he would give his parole not to oppose the military authorities, and this he declined to do, frankly stating the reason to me of that declination which was in substance as follows:
That there was no special occasion for holding this special form of court at the present time, but that it was to be held as a tentative process by which to bring on a conflict between the supposed civil and the military authorities of this Department, and that in doing this he was acting under the advice of the Attorney General of the United States who desired this action to be had, so that by the enforcement of the military orders of the department, the Comdg. General and the military authorities
would be brought in conflict with the supposed civil authorities, and that some disgrace and odium might attach thereby to the military administration of the government in this Department, for although that government is carried on through the humble instrumentality of the Comdg. General, yet he takes leave to consider that his orders are those of the government of the United States until revoked, over-ruled, and set aside by the Commander in Chief of the Army and Navy.
It is not for the Comdg. General to use words of epithet upon the conduct of the Attorney General of the United States in endeavoring to bring on a conflict between the military authorities of the United States and the supposed civil authority of the State of Virginia. If the restored government of Virginia has civil rights, civil powers, civil duties and functions recognized by the laws of Congress and the Constitution, it is the duty of the administration in all its branches, as well in the office of the Comdg. General as in the office of the Attorney General, to sustain, uphold, protect, and defend those civil rights and duties. If the restored government of Virginia has not such civil rights, duties, powers and functions in the garrisons of the United States troops in Virginia, it is not the duty of the Attorney General, any more than it is the duty of the Comdg. General, of this Department, to uphold these rights and powers and duties. It is only the respect which the Comdg. General feels for the associations in which he finds the Attorney General of the United States which prevents him from epithetizing this ruse or trick, which is intended to bring on a conflict between the various departments of the government, which should work in harmony, with words of fit and proper characterization.
The Comdg. General feels humiliated for the administration of the government that it should have been thought necessary by a cabinet officer to resort to such means to [elucidate] a great political principle, or to sustain great political rights. If it is true, and I pray the President of the United States and Commander in Chief to make due inquiry and ascertain the truth, and my remarks are predicated upon the supposition of the truth as it has been informed to me, that this contrivance has been arranged for this purpose, then it becomes my duty to ask if this is the co-operation which the Comdg. Generals of the Armies in the field, encamped within sound of the enemies' guns thundering in their ears, are to receive from a gentleman in the Cabinet of the United States, sitting at Washington,
while he is calling upon the same armies to protect his person from raids by his friends in arms from his own state.
The public prints in opposition to the administration inform the people day by day that through machinations, intrigues, contrivances, and pettifogging devices the Generals Comdg. armies in the field are thwarted, hindered, annoyed and delayed in pursuing measures they are taking in suppression of the rebellion. The Comdg. General in this department has always believed and still does believe and will continue to believe, until such action is taken as to convince him of truth of the contrary, that these publications were but slanders upon the Government and its administration, which he has sustained in every way that his judgment and his ability would permit him as identical with the interests of the country.
The judgment of the Comd'g. General after due and mature reflection is satisfied that such interference as is proposed by the Attorney General of the United States will weaken his authority, embarrass his action, and make it necessary to draw from his command a larger garrison to maintain peace and quiet in the City of Norfolk than would be otherwise needed, and would be wholly disastrous, so far as there is power to bring disaster from such sources, and therefore if the course of the Attorney General of the United States and his supposed coadjutor, Snead, is sustained by the President, it must be taken to be an expression on the part of the President that he is no longer satisfied of the capacity or judgment of the Comdg. General to administer the affairs in this Department of Virginia, and he will therefore pray the President to put in command of that department an officer in whose capacity he has confidence and whose administration will not need to be embarrassed by the ruses and contrivances of the Attorney General of the United States.
In the interview between Mr. Snead and the Comdg. General he frankly admitted that the restored government of Virginia had neither people, power, territory, or revenue except so much of the last as they could derive from licenses upon trade. How far such a civil government will be sustained by the United States, unknown to its laws and its constitution, is a question which the Comdg. General desires to submit to the chief executive of the nation. Perhaps no better illustration of the danger to our institutions and uselessness of such a government could be devised than to examine for a moment the bearing of the restored Government of Virginia upon the Presidential election.
If this creation is the true and legitimate government of Virginia, then in the next electoral congress it is entitled to twelve electoral votes. The disloyal people within that supposed restored government can at any moment control these twelve electoral votes. If the loyal North should elect a Union-loving patriot to the Presidency by a majority of eleven (11) electoral votes, does any one think they would allow that choice to be defeated by the twelve (12) disloyal votes of Virginia, representing no man and no territory? Or would any Union-loving, high-minded, patriotic gentleman take his seat in the Presidential chair against the vote of the majority of the true citizens of the loyal states because of a majority given him by the twelve (12) votes of the restored Government of Virginia, representing no man or no territory? In either event, these votes would be only potent for mischief. If thrown by disloyal men who are by the restored constitution of Virginia entitled to vote against the loyal states, they will never be allowed to be counted by the good sense of the loyal people. If thrown for the loyal candidate, then the opposition may well claim that such are illegalized, or voided election, and afford a just pretext for revolution. So far as I can perceive, this pretended organization is fraught only with wrong, can in no way aid the true and loyal, but may deeply embarrass them.
It is agreed that considerations of expediency should never control political rights or determine questions of law, but with a law undefined, with a state resting solely upon the fiat of the executive for its organization and being, expediency and the mischiefs to be caused thereby may well be considered upon the question of issuing that fiat and breathing the breath of life into that which would be otherwise a lean and dead carcass.
Whenever the Attorney Genl. of the United States shall have conducted the affairs of his proper Department with such energy, efficiency, and ability as to leave nothing to be desired, and make them and himself wholly acceptable to the loyal people of the United States, then I have no doubt that the military commanders would be very glad of his services to aid them. But not until then, it is respectfully submitted, can his exertions be spared from his legitimate sphere. If the learned Attorney General has a fancy for intermeddling with the affairs of disloyal people in a state, it might be suggested that Missouri opens a fine field for the exercise of his talents in that direction.
Because of the urgency of the case to prevent all possible
interference with the administration of the departmental affairs to which it refers and the peculiar nature of the subject, it is believed that it is proper to forward this report directly to the President, and not through military channels. I have the honor to be,
Your obedient servant, Benj. F. Butler, Maj. Genl. Comdg."

As the military reasons are entirely beyond my knowledge, I will only speak of men, in relation to your interests. Capt.

Major Hoffman we knew in New Orleans, and we knew him to be not over friendly to yourself,
or those more intimately connected with you. His ambition always seemed to be (and the spirit begins to manifest itself here) to find a way of his own for doing everything, and sometimes offensively intimating, or saying rather, ""They have a strange way of doing things in this department."" To illustrate -- he sends his clerk to this office, with instructions to sign published orders with the Commanding General's name in small caps., and the Adjt. Genl's. name in caps. -- that the present way is in bad taste. Richard B. Irwin did the same thing in New Orleans. This is only a sample of Hoffman's peculiarities. Capt. Clark can give you many details. I regard him (H.) as a man not capable of appreciating much confidence, an insidious and somewhat dangerous person, not fit to be too near you or any very prominent point of your department.

You further did me the honor to say that you were advised to this course by high authority in Washington. That you had consulted the Attorney General of the United States, and that he had given his opinion in favor of your proposition, and you further said to me that it was thought by that very high authority, that your attempt to hold court would be the very best way to bring on a collision between the military authorities and the supposed civil government. You further said to me that you expected to be sustained by the Cabinet because of the advice you had received from this same high authority. You also stated that you had consulted with nobody on this subject in Washington except the Attorney General.
Will you now do me the favor to answer if I understood you correctly in these various propositions, and also to answer me categorically whether or not you referred to the Attorney General of the United States as the high authority who advised you to this course?
Of course, a matter of communication between a Cabinet officer and a State officer in regard to the performance of the public duties cannot be a secret which you are bound or could desire to keep. These things cannot be done in a corner, and mystery or secrecy upon such subjects would only savor of fraud and deceit, and a matter of so grave moment as this collision thus brought on between the claimed civil and the military authorities, ought not to be disposed of even upon the recollections of several witnesses, and therefore I have ventured to ask your reply to these questions in writing.

Department of Virginia and North Carolina
Sir: In reply to your communication, I have the honor to say that I am not able to state in precise terms the conversation between you and myself, but will endeavor to state the substance thereof, to the best of my recollection. I have no recollection of saying that the Court I ""proposed to hold in Norfolk would not have been held except for the purpose of trying the question of obedience to ‘your’ military order."" That was undoubtedly one of the objects, but had no such order been issued, I should have called a special term at that time, because the business before the Court had not been all disposed of. I may have used the language you seem to impute to me; but, if I did, I do not remember it. Certain it is that I should have called a special term if no occasion had existed for testing the question of obedience to your Order. When I left Norfolk for Washington I had not adjourned my Court finally, and expected to return before the term should expire by operation of law; but in this I am disappointed. And on my return, I issued my warrant for a special term for the purpose of trying the question of obedience to your Order, as well as of trying the undisposed of cases, ready for trial at the former term. I distinctly
remember saying to you, in answer to your question why I proposed to hold Court in opposition to your order, that I was induced to do so because I believed it to be my right and my duty, and because I was so advised by high authority in Washington. The authority referred to was the Attorney General. I said he had given his opinion in favor of our right to maintain civil government in Norfolk in opposition to your Order -- that is, that a military commander was not authorised in abolishing civil government there, under the circumstances of the case, and in the way proposed. I have no recollection of saying that the ""high authority"" referred to, said my attempt to hold Court would be ""the very best way of bringing on a collision between the military authorities and the civil government."" I am sure the Attorney General never made use of the word ""collision."" The language I used, according to my present recollection, was that my attempt to hold Court would test the question. Of course, the attempt to hold Court would necessarily bring on a ""collision"" between the two parties, unless such an event should be averted by the timely intervention of the President.
I did say that I expected to be sustained by the President from what the Attorney General said to me. I further stated that I had no personal consultation with any other Cabinet officer, in reference to this subject, except the Attorney General.
In conclusion, I wish to add by way of personal explanation, that I was not controlled in my action by the advice of the Attorney General, and should not have followed it but that I regarded such a cause as enjoined upon me by a high sense of duty and of right. I am, General, very respectfully,
Your obedient Servant, Edward K. Snead"

The President
In the case of Edward K. Snead of Norfolk, who was stayed because he threatened disobedience to my orders, and whose case I have reported to you by mail, no further present action need be taken, as Snead has given his word not to disobey any military order of this Department, and he has been released to go about his business.

Maj. Gen. Ord, Comd'g 18th A. C.
General: As your negro troops have had a pretty hard time of service for fresh hands, I propose that General Paine shall send you from the troops on this line an equal number with what you name, now returning those you have here for the purpose of reorganization and recruitment.
I hope you can so manage it as to put a brigade together and give them a defined position of the line to hold, so that upon them & their officers may be a responsibility which all may feel. It will be much for the advantage of the service, in my judgment, if these colored troops are kept together, and as soon as we can get them fairly reorganized and a little recruited we will have a division together.
Benj. F. Butler, Maj. Genl. Comd'g."

My dearest Sarah: I am much grieved to learn of your continued weakness. I think you had really better go North for two or three weeks, and if you will I will try and come down and see you. That at least will furnish an excuse.
Dr. McCormick is going up on the ""Atlantic,"" and perhaps you could go directly if there was not any sea. You would run up there in twenty-four hours.
We are in great trouble here -- crimination and incrimination. Grant was sick all day yesterday, so he could not be seen, so I have not had the particulars of the affairs from him. I do not think your inference has anything to found itself upon. That Lincoln had anything to do with paying the usual compliments would be so far-fetched as not to justify an inference.
That your letters should show you sick and sad makes me very sad. Indeed I have literally nobody here now, so that I cannot leave. Do go over and see Martin, poor fellow; it is very sad. Go to see Weitzel occasionally or he will get the blues. I believe the Doctor is going to try and get him on board the ""Atlantic"" for New York. Judge Snead of Norfolk has given his parole to behave well, and I have release him. I have made it a test case in regard to interference with my
military authority. I am determined to get away from here, if I can with honor to myself and profit to the country, at any rate. I will not be interfered with causelessly and wickedly.
Yours truly as ever, Benj."

A deserter from the 25 S. C. informs us that the rumor is that Kershaw's Division went South on Monday night. Another deserter from the 42 Va. & C. Hoke's Division says that Kershaw's Division was on his right, but that it was rumored it had gone South, and that, on the night the rumor was heard, trains were moving all night South. Field's Division is on our front at Deep Bottom. We have both prisoners and deserters from it. Men from Pickett's Division come in daily from our front. We have heard of no special movements there.

I understand strong efforts are being made to have taken from this Department the counties of Accomac and North-umberland, commonly called the Eastern shore.
I could have no objection to this, provided I did not know that it was in order to get rid of the very stringent regulations and system of guards by which we prevent smuggling, and in order that the sale of whiskey may be unlimited in that District.
It is one of the series of movements of Gov. Pierpont against the Comd'g Gen'l of the Department, to which I take leave to call your attention. I should be quite willing to have the question settled by the votes of the loyal and respectable men of those counties.
Benj. F. Butler, Maj. Genl. Comd'g."

There is no probability that counties of Accomac & North-umberland will be separated from your Com'd. Certainly not with my assent. The application I have permanently refused.

My dear, dear Sarah: If I thought you were not sick I would scold you terribly, but I fear you are sick, weak, and wearied, and cannot write. When the mail came I opened each package -- no letter -- perhaps it is overlooked in the envelope. I pick them up from the floor and look them through. Still no letter. I was sad.
Your letter has been the close of the day with me. It came as evening shades stole over the woods, and I would read it and muse over it as I listened to the booming cannon with monotonous regularity throwing shells into Petersburg. It often brought sad fancies because it shew you were sad, but always sweet, as it was never without the evidence that you loved, aye, and confided in me, but last night no letter, and then in the solemn stillness of the quiet camp, with the bright stars of midnight looking in upon me, and the dull, steady tramp of the sentinel the only living sound, I read your long letter which you gave me in hand. ""So sweet, so sad, and awesome that my heart almost broke as I listened to it."" I say again and again that you mistake me wholly, fully, thoroughly. You put down as the purpose of a lifetime and enduring thought of the mind the foolish not even fancy but accident of the hour. Nay, of the moment. You erect into a settled plan and fixed design what was but an occurrence. You make a part of the voyage of life, on to its port of destination, that deviation which was and is but a stupid and foolish blunder of the helmsman. You set down as a part of the original purpose and chart of the voyage acts which were only intended and done to correct the blunder of the steersman. But sadly, beautifully have you wrought it out, and admiration, love, sadness, pity, sympathy, and yearning tenderness, mingled with whirling celerity as I read. Ah me! That my faults should return to me with such vivid painting by such a hand! I wish much to see you. Will convince you of the mistake, and tell you that a fervent and vivid imagination has only pictured a day-dream and not a reality.
All is well here, but everybody sadly despondent.
Yours as ever surely and truly, Benj. F. B."

My own dear Love: What a day of disappointments! Alas for the soft crabs! Don't you think a few soft crabs would tickle the palate of a Major Genl. commanding as well as of a Cabinet Minister? Then next day another disappointment -- no letter. I know it was a disappointment. You need not say it was not. Now, I had my little disappointments. I wanted the ""Greyhound."" She had been sent to Fortress Monroe with the mail. So I could not have her. Disappointment No. 1. Then I at once telegraphed to Col. Shaffer to come up in her and bring you. I was at General Grant's when she came by with but a carriage on board. I made sure that I should see you, specially as she went up to the Point of Rocks, and hurried away from the General to meet you, but alas, you were not. Now a Cabinet Minister was nothing to that. No, nor a million of soft crabs.
Then Gen. Rawlins, Gen. Grant's Chief of Staff, wanted to go to Washington, and they wanted the ""Greyhound,"" but they should not have had her except that she will be back at the Fortress tomorrow and will bring you up. You must come. I will have the fatted calf killed. She will be at the Fortress tomorrow, and you must come after the shower -- the air is delightful. You can have her start at precisely such an hour as you choose. Perhaps Mrs. Shaffer will come with you. Shaffer will, certain.
Thank you a thousand times for your graceful, sprightly, spirited letter. No, it was not sad, and shew that phase of your mind which I admire so much. Only write so also never feeling and therefore never seeming sad.
We shall have a movement here in a day or two, but I cannot write you of it. I fear it has already been let out by an indiscreet officer. You and Buntie must come up.
Yours, Benj."
