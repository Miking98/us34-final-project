		<h2>Michael & Theo's US 34 Final Project</h2>
	</div>
	<div class="card-body">
		<p>In this project, we set out to analyze Civil War data in order to substantiate themes from the course and hopefully find new interesting patterns as well. We surveyed several categories of data and created this website as the end product through which we present our findings.</p>
		<p>The first major way in we succeeded in meeting our goals was our creation of the letter analysis tool, which can be found on the project website under the tab labeled “Letters.” The tool allows for a user to enter one or more keywords and see how their frequency of use in around 4,000 letters from the Civil War period varies with respect to time. While we had hoped that this aspect of the project would yield interesting results, it surpassed all of our expectations. The tool illuminates all sorts of fascinating trends, from the changing interpretation of god during the war, to the rise and fall of army commanders, to discussions surrounding key battles in their aftermath. It can even be used to substantiate or refute modern positions, such as the common claim that the civil war was fought over “state’s rights”; this phrase appears in literally none of the letters we sampled. We have provided a list of interesting patterns on the website so that any users can investigate these instances for themselves. Ultimately, the letters applet shows users how although communication during the Civil War era was much more restricted and isolated than it is in today’s hyper-connected technological environment, public and private discussion still followed well-defined movements depending on current events and updates on the status of the war.</p>
		<p>Another way in which we were able to illustrate historical data was through our exploration of data on Union Army Recruits. With a sample of 39,000 white Union army veterans, we created an informative map that allows the user to explore recruitment trends on a county-to-county basis. This data set was by far more coherent than any we could find for confederate soldiers or for black soldiers fighting for the Union, but we hope that these data points can eventually be added to our work. The map reveals pockets of local wealth along the East Coast and, somewhat more surprisingly, in the westmost portions of the Union. Furthermore, it reveals examples of soldiers who lived in Confederate counties but chose to enlist in the Union army. We found these soldiers to be older on average than those who enlisted from within the union.</p>
		<p>Our final section within the website is the “Modern Trends” tab, which outlines connections between Civil War era divisions and data from modern periods. For instance, we compare the Union-Confederacy map, states with education segregation laws in 1954, and states which voted against the 1964 Civil Rights Act. These data selections allow for us to directly view the manner in which the Civil War is still being culturally and politically fought to this day. This culminates in a final data sample in which modern rates of disenfranchisement among black adults are examined, and we see that in reality, this is slavery under a different, present-day guise; the 14th Amendment explicitly makes this exception in allowing slavery “as punishment for crime whereof the party shall have been duly convicted.”</p>
		<p>We did face difficulties throughout the duration of this work, both in terms of technological bugs and scarce source material. Unfortunately, we had one major goal which we were not able to accomplish, mostly due to constraints beyond our control. We initially intended to use the Twitter API to perform a sentiment analysis on discussions surrounding the Civil War, which would provide a window into the ways that the war’s legacy has been interpreted. However, after initially formalizing our application to register as developers with Twitter, we did not receive a response. This area remains as one way in which we could expand this data project and find even more trends in our society to which we can draw connections from our other analyses of the Civil War period.</p>
		<p>We hope that through our data analysis project and the resulting website platform, users can both garner historical insight into media trends in the Civil War period and see the ways in which the war is still being fought to this day. This project was illuminating for us, and we hope that the visitors to our sight feel the same way and create historical data projects of their own!</p>
